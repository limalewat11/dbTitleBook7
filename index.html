There, in shimmering glory, was a beautiful woman draped in gold jewelry, looking satisfied and happy. Across the pages in bold lettering were the words: &#x201c;The Gold Shivers.&#x201d; I felt both amused and appalled as I read the pitch:<br><br>From the First Small Shiver<br><br>when a Shimmering Necklace of Gold Beads Catches a Woman&#x2019;s Eye.<br><br>To the Great Shivers of Delight<br><br>when the Coveted Object Actually Becomes Hers . . .<br><br>Among Life&#x2019;s Pleasures, Count this Deeply Held Euphoria as Unique.<br><br>The Only Way to Get the Gold Shivers is by Getting the Gold.<br><br>Because we&#x2019;re bombarded with thousands of marketing messages like this every day, it&#x2019;s easy to think that gratifying our desires is the way to find happiness. We might even know, as one bumper sticker says, &#x201c;The best things in life are not things,&#x201d; but we can still believe that something else out there will make us happy. When I find my soul mate, or when I write the great American novel, or when I retir . . .<br><br>There&#x2019;s no denying the hit of pleasure we feel when we fulfill a desire for a particular experience or object or goal. But how long does the satisfaction last once we receive the &#x201c;coveted object&#x201d;? Perhaps until we notice there&#x2019;s something else we want. When we equate true happiness with getting something (or someone), we can end up like hamsters in an exercise wheel&#x2014;running but never arriving.<br><br>If genuine happiness is not based on objects or experience, where can it be found? And how? Like following a road map, once you know where you&#x2019;re going, it&#x2019;s easier to figure out how to get there.<br><br>TAKING THE FIRST STEP<br><br>The journey of awakening joy begins with setting a clear intention. Although we all want to be happy, most of us don&#x2019;t place an explicit wish for that at the center of our lives. We think if we are successful, rich, or liked by others, happiness will come. We tend to hope that achieving certain goals in the future will make us happy. But these are roundabout ways to get to happiness, and they don&#x2019;t necessarily work. What does get you there is starting where you are and discovering what you are looking for in the midst of your current life.<br><br>You might think that the circumstances of your life will have to change a lot before you can find happiness in the midst of them. While it&#x2019;s true that our well-being is affected by how we live, we also know that even in the best of circumstances we can be unhappy. And sometimes in very challenging situations, we can feel surprisingly at ease. While this book will encourage you to bring experiences and circumstances into your life that contribute to your well-being, the key factor is deciding to change your mind. As my colleague Sylvia Boorstein puts it, &#x201c;Happiness is an inside job.&#x201d; When we consciously intend to be happy, actually saying that intention aloud or to ourselves, we set in motion a radical transformation. Profound changes begin to take place inside us, in our body and our mind. The momentum of positive change grows as we learn to choose actions and situations that align us with our intention.<br><br>THE GOLD OF TRUE HAPPINESS<br><br>I was a gloomy existentialist in college until one day it struck me that I actually wanted to be happy. I believed the only way to achieve that was to get and to do what I wanted. My personal strategy to ensure happiness was trying to string together enough moments of pleasure and gratification that the underlying unease couldn&#x2019;t get through. Getting the latest album of cool music felt good&#x2014;for a little while. Having fun at a wild party was exhilarating&#x2014;at the time. But no matter how many happy moments I had, I still didn&#x2019;t feel any closer to being a &#x201c;happy person.&#x201d; I felt like I was on a roller coaster, and the ride down seemed to last a lot longer than the occasional trip up. There had to be another way.<br><br>That was what led me in 1974 to Naropa Institute, a kind of spiritual summer camp, in Boulder, Colorado. I&#x2019;d read some books on Eastern philosophy that made me question a lot of my assumptions, and I wanted to check things out for myself. When I walked into meditation class that first day, I was excited about the promise of an exotic new teaching. There in the front of the room a man was sitting cross- legged&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t at all fit my image of the great spiritual guru I was expecting to see. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t seem very different from me. He was Jewish and sounded like he was from New York, and I wondered if this guy could really tell me something new. But after spending the first ten minutes of the lecture judging the package, I decided to start listening to what he was saying.<br><br>Within moments it was clear that Joseph Goldstein understood something about genuine freedom and happiness and how to get there. I saw for the first time the possibility of not being a slave to my neurotic thoughts and fears. By the end of the class, I knew I had found a sure road to happiness, and I was determined to follow it.<br><br>Joseph talked a lot about one of the basic teachings of the Buddha&#x2014; the recognition that everything we experience in life is impermanent. No matter how good things are, they will change. Well, that&#x2019;s for sure, I thought. That&#x2019;s the story of my life. We don&#x2019;t get what we want and feel frustrated. We get what we don&#x2019;t want and feel upset. Or we get what we want and then find out it doesn&#x2019;t quite satisfy us in the way we thought it would. We find that the pleasure of the gold shivers lasts for a few moments, then fades away. As those famous &#x201c;philosophers,&#x201d; the Rolling Stones, so profoundly put it: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get no satisfaction.&#x201d;<br><br>Because everything changes, no circumstance, experience, or object can give us lasting happiness. Our bodies change, our minds change, the seasons change. Yet we try to hold on to pleasure, youth, summertime, happiness. As Joseph puts it, trying to hold on to anything in an ever-changing reality is like holding tight to a rope you&#x2019;re sliding down. All you get is rope burn. And the more you hold on, the more you suffer.<br><br>What is the way out of this predicament? Awakening joy isn&#x2019;t about fulfilling goals or changing particular circumstances. It&#x2019;s about training the mind and heart to live in a way that allows us to be truly happy with our life as it is right now. Not that we stop aspiring to grow and change in positive ways, or that we remain in harmful situations, but we begin to find the joy inside us right where we are. As you work with the practices offered here, you will discover that happiness is not a place you arrive at but rather the result of training your mind to ride with ease and flexibility the roller coaster of life.<br><br>DECIDING TO BE HAPPY<br><br>Vickie was hoping for a miracle. For five years she had been living with chronic pain, unrelieved by anything doctors and healers had been able to offer. By the time we spoke, her disappointment had spiraled down into severe bouts of depression. &#x201c;Often I break down and cry just from trying to get through the day,&#x201d; she told me. Vickie had come to talk about whether or not she should enroll in an Awakening Joy course. &#x201c;But I just can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s possible for me to be happy,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Recently her situation had gotten even harder. Friends who had been trying to help for years had begun to drift away, afraid of being pulled into the black hole of Vickie&#x2019;s despair. &#x201c;And my boyfriend has real doubts about our future,&#x201d; she said through tears. &#x201c;I know he loves me and feels a lot of compassion for me, but he says he wonders if I haven&#x2019;t given up on life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going through so much, Vickie,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve seen other people going through really hard times make major changes when they decide to. I think you can do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite her doubts, Vickie decided to enroll in the course. The very first meeting of the group proved to be a critical turning point for her. As usual I opened the course by asking participants to get in touch with their intention to bring more happiness into their lives. The evening was spent exploring this uplifting prospect, and by the time the class ended, the room was filled with enthusiasm and promise. Some participants lingered to talk with friends, and others came up to ask questions or make comments. I noticed Vickie sitting quietly at the side of the room, and when the others had left, I went over to see if she was okay.<br><br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see how this will work for me, given my physical condition,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even conceive of what it would be like to be joyful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand how you can feel that way,&#x201d; I said, taking a seat next to her. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t try to be any different from how you are at this moment. But I think the most important ingredient in changing your situation is letting yourself open to the possibility of finding joy in your life. That needs to happen before you can get clear on your intention.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew there had to be a way to help her realize she had the capacity to enjoy her life. I had seen so many people, including myself, turn their lives around once they had embraced that possibility.<br><br>&#x201c;Vickie, are there ever any moments in your life when you&#x2019;re enjoying something?&#x201d; I asked her.<br><br>She replied, a little hesitantly, &#x201c;Yes . . .when I play with my three-year-old niece.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you right now bring to mind an image of playing with your niece?&#x201d;<br><br>Vickie settled into her chair and closed her eyes. Almost immediately a tiny smile appeared.<br><br>&#x201c;Now just stay with that image and those feelings for a few moments,&#x201d; I suggested. I could see a subtle change pass over her face as she sat there in silence. When I asked her to describe what she was feeling, it took her a while to find the words.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel a kind of tingling throughout my body . . .a lightness in my mind . . .my heart feels warm . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, good. Now let yourself breathe in that feeling, allowing it to deepen with each breath,&#x201d; I suggested, knowing that letting the experience fully register in her body and mind was a key to making the shift she wanted.<br><br>&#x201c;Now project your mind forward in time and imagine that you&#x2019;ve practiced accessing this feeling of well-being regularly during the next ten months of the course. Can you tell me what your life would look like then?&#x201d;<br><br>I could see Vickie&#x2019;s body relax as she reflected.<br><br>&#x201c;I have less stress . . .I enjoy being with my friends again . . .I see myself taking more walks in nature, and letting myself have more fun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. If this feels worth going for,&#x201d; I said softly, &#x201c;take your time to get in touch with your intention to make it happen. See if you can decide that you&#x2019;ll do your part to bring it about.&#x201d;<br><br>As she silently contemplated that suggestion, it looked to me as if Vickie&#x2019;s body actually grew lighter. When she finally opened her eyes, the smile she gave me was genuine and bright. &#x201c;That was amazing,&#x201d; she offered. &#x201c;Something in me said not only can I do this but I&#x2019;m going to do this.&#x201d; That decision began a process within her that would eventually look like the miracle she had longed for. As the saying goes, &#x201c;God helps those who help themselves,&#x201d; and Vickie&#x2019;s &#x201c;miracle&#x201d; was actually set in motion when she was willing to open to the possibility of joy.<br><br>FINDING THE &#x201c;MAGIC&#x201d; WORDS<br><br>FOR YOUR INTENTION<br><br>As Vickie found, setting the intention to awaken joy works best once you&#x2019;ve recalled your capacity to be happy. Trusting that knowledge, you can make the heartfelt decision to do your part to make that happen. This is the heart of setting your intention to be happy&#x2014;your determination to do what you can to fulfill your vision.<br><br>Finding a phrase that encapsulates your intention is a useful way to remind yourself of your direction. You might say something like &#x201c;I intend to allow more joy into my life,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I want to experience more happiness each day,&#x201d; or &#x201c;May I live with a greater sense of well- being.&#x201d; The exact way you phrase your intention doesn&#x2019;t matter, and the wording may change over time. What&#x2019;s most important is to begin.<br><br>Joan wrote from Canada about the struggle she got into when she tried to find the perfect way to state her intention. She had joined the Awakening Joy course in order to find more joy in her relationships with her husband and two children. &#x201c;I keep falling into knee-jerk reactions such as irritation and negativity with them,&#x201d; she wrote. Because the change she was looking for felt so important, Joan wanted the phrase she used to state her intention to be exactly right.<br><br>After several frustrating days of trying out various possibilities, she decided to just sit quietly and see what came. The words that arose were &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give joy a shot.&#x201d; Not at all the profound phrase she was looking for! &#x201c;I felt almost repulsed by the words and dismissed them,&#x201d; she wrote. But the phrase kept coming back. At some point Joan realized, &#x201c;I can just be silly with the intention and stop worrying about the &#x2018;right&#x2019; words. Instead I can try to stay connected with the raw energy behind these &#x2018;silly&#x2019; words and go for it!&#x201d;<br><br>A GAME OF REMINDERS<br><br>The more you do something, the easier it gets. The more often you remind yourself that you are actually intending to bring more feelings of joy and well-being into your life, the more you will be open to them when they arise. And when you remain aware of your intention to grow in happiness, you&#x2019;re more likely to make choices to support it.</p><h2>The Moor</h2><p>Though theirs is a marriage of true equals, when Sherlock Holmes summons his wife and partner Mary Russell to the eerie scene of his most celebrated case, she abandons her Oxford studies to aid his investigation. But this time, on Dartmoor, there is more to the matter than a phantom hound. Sightings of a spectral coach carrying a long-dead noblewoman over the moonlit moor have heralded a mysterious death, the corpse surrounded by oversize paw prints. Here on this wild and foreboding moor, Russell and Holmes embark on a quest with few clues save a fanatic anthropologist, an ancestral portrait, a moorland witch, and a lowly&#x2013;but most revealing&#x2013;hedgehog. As Holmes and Russell anticipate, a rational explanation lies beneath the supernatural events&#x2013;but one darker than they could have imagined. And one that could end their lives in this harsh and desolate land.</p><p>Longtime fans of Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, might think that their favorite sleuth met his fate at the hands of Dr. Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Anyone who believes that, however, obviously hasn't read Laurie R. King's delightful series featuring Holmes and his wife(!), Mary Russell. In <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i>, Holmes succumbs to the Oxford scholar's charms; now, in <i>The Moor</i>, fourth in the series, Holmes and Russell are summoned to Devonshire to solve a tin miner's mysterious death. Lonely Dartmoor provides plenty of opportunities for King to both relate the haunting legends of that part of the world and offer some amusing revisions to one of Holmes's most famous cases, <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>. Though Holmes purists might resent the liberties taken with their hero, readers in search of a strong female protagonist, some fascinating local history, and spooky ambience will enjoy <i>The Moor</i>.Barely has Mary Russell resumed her 1923 studies at Oxford when she is summoned by her partner and husband Sherlock Holmes to the eerie scene of his most celebrated case.But this time, on Dartmoor, there is more to the matter than a phantom hound.<br><br>Sightings of a spectral coach carrying a long-dead noblewoman over the moonlit moor have heralded a mysterious death, the corpse surrounded by oversize paw prints.Here on this wild and foreboding moor, Russell and Holmes embark on a quest with few clues save a fanatic anthropologist, an ancestral portrait, a moorland witch, and a lowly--but most revealing--hedgehog.As Holmes and Russell anticipate, a rational explanation lies beneath the supernatural events--but one darker than they could have imagined.And one that could end their lives in this harsh and desolate land.</p><h2>Adrift: Seventy-Six Days Lost at Sea</h2><p>The author recalls his seventy-six-day ordeal adrift in the Atlantic Ocean in a five-foot inflatable raft after the sinking of his sailboat, recounting his problems surviving the weather, shark attacks, a leaking raft, and, above all, the lack of food and</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesIMES besteller, this true story tells the riveting, first-hand account of the only man in history to have survived more than a month alone at sea,fighting for his life in an inflatable raft after his small sloop capsized only six days out.

It boasted a �twelfth-�century church, an equally ancient bridge, and a weekly cattle market that supplied the butcher shops of Paris and, every Tuesday, left the medieval streets steaming with manure. There was little �else in Poissy except for the ancient priory of �Saint-�Louis, a walled convent that had once been home to an order of Dominican nuns. The nuns had been evicted during the French Revolution and the convent&#x2019;s buildings either demolished or sold to private buyers. But inside the enclosure remained an enormous, spired church almost a hundred yards in length and, close by, a grandiose �house with clusters of balconies, dormer windows and �pink-�bricked chimneys: a building sometimes known as the Grande Maison.<br><br>Ernest Meissonier had occupied the Grande Maison for most of the previous two de�cades. In his �forty-�eighth year he was short, arrogant and densely bearded: &#x201c;ugly, little and mean,&#x201d; one observer put it, &#x201c;rather a scrap of a man.&#x201d;2 A friend described him as looking like a professor of gymnastics, and indeed the burly Meissonier was an eager and accomplished athlete, often rising before dawn to rampage through the countryside on �horse�back, swim in the Seine, or launch himself at an opponent, �fencing �sword in hand. Only after an hour or two of these exertions would he retire, sometimes still shod in his riding boots, to a studio in the Grande Maison where he spent ten or twelve hours each day crafting on his easel the wonders of precision and meticulousness that had made both his reputation and his fortune.<br><br>To overstate either Meissonier&#x2019;s reputation or his fortune would have been difficult in the year 1863. &#x201c;At no period,&#x201d; a contemporary claimed, &#x201c;can we point to a French paint�er to whom such high distinctions �were awarded, whose works �were so eagerly sought after, whose material interests �were so guaranteed by the high prices offered for every production of his brush.&#x201d; No artist in France could command Meissonier&#x2019;s extravagant prices or excite so much public attention. Each year at the Paris �Salon &#x2013; the annual art exhibition in the Palais des �Champs-�lys�es &#x2013; the space before Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings grew so thick with spectators that a special policeman was needed to regulate the masses as they pressed forward to inspect his latest success. Collected by wealthy connoisseurs such as James de Rothschild and the Duc d&#x2019;Aumale, these paintings proved such lucrative investments that Meissonier&#x2019;s signature was said to be worth that of the Bank of France. &#x201c;The prices of his works,&#x201d; noted one awestruck art critic, &#x201c;have attained formidable proportions, never before known.&#x201d;<br><br>Meissonier&#x2019;s success in the auction rooms was accompanied by a chorus of critical praise �and &#x2013; even more unusual for an art world riven by savage rivalries and piffling �jealousies &#x2013; the respect and admiration of his peers. &#x201c;He is the incontestable master of our epoch,&#x201d; declared Eug�ne Delacroix, who predicted to the poet Charles Baudelaire that &#x201c;amongst all of us, surely it is he who is most certain to survive!&#x201d; Another of Meissonier&#x2019;s friends, the writer Alexandre Dumas <i>fils</i>, called him &#x201c;<i>the</i> paint�er of France.&#x201d; He was simply, as a newspaper breathlessly reported, &#x201c;the most renowned artist of our time.&#x201d;<br><br>From his vantage point at the top of his mansion this most renowned artist could have seen all that his tremendous success had bought him. A stable �housed his eight �horses and a coach �house his fleet of carriages, which included expensive landaus, berlines, and victorias. He even owned the fastest vehicle on the road, a mail coach. All �were decorated, in one of his typically lordly gestures, with a crest that bore his most fitting motto: <i>Omnia labor</i>, or &#x201c;Everything by work.&#x201d; A green�house, a saddlery, an En�glish garden, a photographic workshop, a duck pond, lodgings for his coachman and groom, and a meadow planted with cherry �trees &#x2013; all �were ranged across a patch of land sloping down to the embankments of the Seine, where his two yachts �were moored. A dozen miles upstream, in the Rue des Pyramides, a fashionable street within steps of both the Jardin des Tuileries and the Louvre, he maintained his Paris apartment.<br><br>The Grande Maison itself stood between the convent&#x2019;s Gothic church and the remains of its ancient cloister. Meissonier had purchased the �pink-�bricked �eighteenth-�century orangery, which was sometimes known as Le Pavillon �Rose, in 1846. In the ensuing years he had spent hundreds of thousands of francs on its expansion and refurbishment in order to create a splendid palace for himself and his family. A turret had been built above an adjoining cottage to �house an enormous cistern that provided the Grande Maison with running water, which was pumped through the �house and garden by means of a steam engine. The �house also boasted a luxurious water closet and, to warm it in winter, a central heating system. A billiard room was available for Meissonier&#x2019;s rare moments away from his easel.<br><br>Yet despite these modern con�ve�niences, the Grande Maison was really intended to be an exquisite antiquarian daydream. &#x201c;My �house and my temperament belong to another age,&#x201d; Meissonier once said. He did not feel at home or at ease in the nineteenth century. He spoke unashamedly of the &#x201c;good old days,&#x201d; by which he meant the eighteenth century and even earlier. He detested the sight of railway stations, �cast-�iron bridges, modern architecture and recent fashions such as frock coats and top hats. He did not like how people sat �cross-�legged and read newspapers and cheap pamphlets instead of �leather-�bound books. And so from the outside his �house&#x2013;all gables, pitched roofs and leaded �windows &#x2013; was a vision of �eighteenth-�century elegance and tranquillity, while on the inside the rooms �were decorated in the style of Louis XV, with expensive tapestries, armoires, embroidered fauteuils, and carved wooden balustrades.<br><br>The Grande Maison included not one but, most unusually, two large studios in which Meissonier could paint his masterpieces. The <i>atelier d&#x2019;hiver</i>, or &#x201c;winter workshop,&#x201d; featuring bay windows and a large fireplace, was on the top floor of the �house, while at ground level, overlooking the garden, he had built a �glass-�roofed annex known as the <i>atelier d&#x2019;�t�</i>, or &#x201c;summer workshop.&#x201d; Both abounded with the tools of his trade: canvases, brushes and easels, but also musical instruments, suits of armor, bridles and harnesses, plumed helmets, and an assortment of halberds, rapiers and �muskets &#x2013; enough weaponry, it was said, to equip a company of mercenaries. For Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings �were, like his �house, recherch� figments of an antiquarian imagination. He specialized in scenes from �seventeenth- and �eighteenth-�century life, portraying an �ever-�growing cast of �silk-�coated and �lace-�ruffed �gentlemen &#x2013; what he called his <i>bonshommes</i>, or &#x201c;goodfellows&#x201d; &#x2013; playing chess, smoking pipes, reading books, sitting before easels or double basses, or posing in the uniforms of musketeers or halberdiers. These musicians and bookworms striking their quiet and reflective poses in serene, softly lit interiors, all executed in microscopic detail, bore uncanny similarities to the work of Jan Vermeer, an artist whose rediscovery in the 1860s owed much to the ravenous taste for �Meissonier &#x2013; and one whose tremendous current popularity approaches the enthusiastic esteem in which Meissonier himself was held in �mid-�nineteenth-�century France.<br><br>Typical of Meissonier&#x2019;s work was one of his most recent creations, <i>Halt at an Inn</i>, owned by the Duc de Morny, a wealthy art collector and the illegitimate half brother of the French Emperor, Napoleon III. Completed in 1862, it featured three �eighteenth-�century cavaliers in tricorn hats being served drinks on �horse�back outside a �half-�timbered rural tavern: a charming vignette of the days of old, without a railway train or top hat in sight. Meissonier&#x2019;s most famous painting, though, was <i>The Brawl</i>, a somewhat less decorous scene depicting a fight in a tavern between two men �dressed &#x2013; as �usual &#x2013; in opulent �eighteenth-�century attire. Awarded the Grand Medal of Honor at the Salon of 1855, it was owned by Queen Victoria, whose husband and consort, Prince Albert, had prized Meissonier above all other artists. At the height of the Crimean War, Napoleon III had purchased the work from Meissonier for 25,000 �francs &#x2013; eight times the annual salary of an average factory �worker &#x2013; and presented it as a gift to his ally across the Channel.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>In Search of the Source</h2><p>Through the compelling story of Bible translators Neil and Carol Anderson, we relearn something we may have forgotten the raw power of God&#39;s Word to wrench human lives from darkness and flood the heart with light, understanding and peace.</p><p></p><h2>Batman : The Dark Knight Returns</h2><p>After ten years away from the public eye, a wave of violence in Gotham City brings Batman back as a vigilante</p><p>If any comic has a claim to have truly reinvigorated the genre, then <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i> by Frank Miller--known also for his excellent <i>Sin City</i> series and his superb rendering of the blind superhero Daredevil--is probably the top contender. Batman represented all that was wrong in comics and Miller set himself a tough task taking on the camp crusader and turning this laughable, innocuous children's cartoon character into a hero for our times. The great Alan Moore (V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing, the arguably peerless <i>Watchmen</i>) argued that only someone of Miller's stature could have done this. Batman is a character known well beyond the confines of the comic world (as are his retinue) and so reinventing him, while keeping his limiting core essentials intact, was a huge task.<p>Miller went far beyond the call of duty. <i>The Dark Knight</i> is a success on every level. Firstly it does keep the core elements of the Batman myth intact, with Robin, Alfred the butler, Commissioner Gordon, and the old roster of villains, present yet brilliantly subverted. Secondly the artwork is fantastic--detailed, sometimes claustrophobic, psychotic. Lastly it's a great story: Gotham City is a hell on earth, street gangs roam but there are no heroes. Decay is ubiquitous. Where is a hero to save Gotham? It is 10 years since the last recorded sighting of the Batman. And things have got worse than ever. Bruce Wayne is close to being a broken man but something is keeping him sane: the need to see change and the belief that he can orchestrate some of that change. Batman is back. The Dark Knight has returned. Awesome. <i>--Mark Thwaite</i></p>Frank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s and rose to fame while first drawing, and then writing, <i>Daredevil</i> for Marvel Comics.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life.

She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim.

Now, she gives listeners a very private look at a life she lived in the public eye for more than 25 years. With the contemporary American history as the backdrop, Mrs. Bush remembers the experiences that led to the White House, from growing up in Rye, New York and meeting George Bush, through life as a young bride and mother and the almost unbearable pain of losing a child. She talks candidly about her years in public life in Washington, New York and China, and describes her role as the wife of the Vice President, culminating in the climactic White House years. Drawing upon excerpts from the diary she has compiled for more than 30 years, Mrs. Bush takes us behind the scenes of the Persian Gulf conflict and the end of the Cold War, and introduces us to the world leaders and their spouses with whom she has developed friendships over the years. She also talks about both the Bushes&#39; struggle to overcome Graves Disease, the disappointment of the 1992 Presidential campaign and the joys of rediscovering private life, and tells us why she threw so much of her energy and compassion behind the important cause of making America more literate.

Even before they joined forces, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written dozens of Broadway shows, but together they pioneered a new art form: the serious musical play. Their songs and dance numbers served to advance the drama and reveal character, a sharp break from the past and the template on which all future musicals would be built.</p><br><p>Though different in personality and often emotionally distant from each other, Rodgers and Hammerstein presented an unbroken front to the world and forged much more than a songwriting team; their partnership was also one of the most profitable and powerful entertainment businesses of their era. They were cultural powerhouses whose work came to define postwar America on stage, screen, television, and radio. But they also had their failures and flops, and more than once they feared they had lost their touch.</p><br><p>Todd S.

In New York City, you&#39;re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you&#39;re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Collins&#39;s musings led to the creation of The Underland Chronicles. &#34;I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it. That you could be going along preoccupied with your own problems and then whoosh! You take a wrong turn in your laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face. No magic, no space or time travel, there&#39;s just a ticket to another world behind your clothes dryer,&#34; Collins says.Suzanne Collins&#39; debut novel, Gregor the Overlander, the first book in The Underland Chronicles, received wide praise both in the United States and abroad. The series has been a New York Times bestseller and received numerous accolades.

Some poems are memories treasured in the mind since childhood; some crystallize the passion of love or recall the trail of loss and sorrow. The poems and poets in this anthology&#x2015;from Sappho to Lorca, from Shakespeare and Chaucer to Gwendolyn Brooks, Louise Bluck, and Allen Ginsberg&#x2015;are poems to be read aloud and memorized, poems to be celebrated as part of our nation's cultural inheritance. Accompanying the poems are comments by people who speak not as professional critics but as passionate readers of various ages, professions and regions. This anthology, in a manner unlike any other, discloses the rich and vigorous presence of poetry in American life at the millennium and provides a portrait of the United States through the lens of poetry.</p><p><i>Americans' Favorite Poems</i> offers keen proof that poetry <i>does</i> make something happen, that it can give strength and perspective, inspire and alter lives, and comfort and surprise. How did this grassroots golden anthology come about? When Robert Pinsky was named U.S. poet laureate in 1997, he hoped to persuade 100 Americans to recite and discuss their favorite works. Even he may have been surprised when thousands were moved to contribute and commune. From the wave of responses, Pinsky has selected 200 poems, each preceded by one or more testimonials. Make no mistake: this collection, ranging in alphabetical order from Ammons to Zagajewski, would be a keeper without any commentary whatsoever. But Pinsky's volume again and again makes clear that for real readers Matthew Arnold is far from outmoded, that people still thrill to Robert Browning, and that Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" is--at least for one Hollywood type--a reflection of reality rather than sublime whimsy. And how about John Donne's "The Flea"? A precocious Arizona 17-year-old deems it not a thorny metaphysical work but "the best argument for sex I've ever heard."<p> Fans will encounter their favorites, from Anna Akhmatova to Langston Hughes to W.B. Yeats, and read them anew in the light of people's passionate comments. But there are also discoveries to be made. A New Mexican treasures "Who Says Words with My Mouth" by the 13th-century Persian poet Jalal Al-Din Rumi: "I can't live without it and I can die with it." And this reader is grateful to one New Yorker for offering up Nazim Hikmet's "Things I Didn't Know I Loved." Twenty-four-year-old Chad Menville writes: "I identify with this poem about imprisonment, censorship, longing, and belief in oneself more than with any other poem I have read. This poem needs to be heard! Please." </p><p> <i>Americans' Favorite Poems</i> really is a national portrait: those who took up Pinsky's challenge range from teachers to prisoners, teenagers to nonagenarians. There are even a few artists. Violinist and conundrum merchant Laurie Anderson sent a long, complex paragraph detailing how George Herbert inspired her to create a talking table: "It compressed the sound and drove it up steel rods so that when you sat with your elbows on the table and your hands to your ears, it was like wearing a pair of powerful headphones." And when it comes to A.E. Housman, the writer William Maxwell opted for simplicity with the sentence fragment: "Because I cannot read it without shuddering with pleasure." That same phrase can be applied to the entire volume. Robert Pinsky's vision is inspiring on every level, proof of his belief in poetry--and people. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p><strong>Maggie Dietz</strong> is the Favorite Poem Project's director.

Farewell to it, and good luck to it. From here on in it would be squared shoulders and jaws, and strong arms and best feet forward. He left the boy a pile of mangled, skinny limbs and stepped through the door a newborn man, stinging a little in the sights of the sprite guiding his metamorphosis. Karine D&#x2019;Arcy was her name. She was fifteen and a bit and had been in his class for the past three years. Outside of school she consistently outclassed him, and yet here she was, standing in his hall on a Monday lunchtime. And so the boy had to go, what was left of him, what hadn&#x2019;t been flayed away by her hands and her kisses.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure your dad won&#x2019;t come home?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said, though his father was a law unto himself and couldn&#x2019;t be trusted to follow reason. This morning he&#x2019;d warned that he&#x2019;d be out and about, so the kids would have to make their own dinner,though he&#x2019;d be back later, trailing divilment and, knowing the kindness of the pit, a foul temper.<br><br>&#x201c;What if he does, though?&#x201d;<br><br>He took his hand from hers and slipped it round her waist.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. Oh, the truth was raw, as raw as you could get, unrehearsed words from a brand-new throat.<br><br>He was fifteen, only just. If she&#x2019;d asked him the same question back before they&#x2019;d crossed this threshold he would have answered according to fifteen years build-up of boyish bravado, but now that everything had changed he couldn&#x2019;t remember how to showboat.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be my fault anyway,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not yours.&#x201d;<br><br>They were supposed to be in school, and even his dad would know it. If he came home now, if, all lopsided with defeat, the worse for wear because of drink, or poker or whatever the fuck, it&#x2019;d still take him only a moment to figure out that his son was on the lang, and for one reason only.<br><br>&#x201c;Here it&#x2019;d be yours,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But what if he told my mamand dad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; It was as certain as the floor beneath them. His father was many things, but none of them responsible. Or bold. Or righteous.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The only people my dad talks to live here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No one else would have him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what do we do now?&#x201d;<br><br>The name of this brave new man, still stinging from the possibilities whipping his flesh and pushing down on his shoulders, was Ryan. In truth, his adult form wasn&#x2019;t all that different to the gawky corpse he&#x2019;d left outside; he was still black-haired and pale-skinned and ink-eyed. &#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re possessed,&#x201d; shivered one of the girls who&#x2019;d gotten close enough to judge; she then declared her intent to try sucking the demon out through his tongue. He was stretching these past few months. Too slow, too steady, his nonna had sighed, the last time she&#x2019;d perused his Facebook photos. She was adamant he&#x2019;d never hit six feet. His mother was four years dead and his father was a wreck who slept as often on the couch as he did in his own bed. Ryan was the oldest of the wreck&#x2019;s children. He tiptoed around his father and made up for it around everyone else.<br><br>Something didn&#x2019;t fit about that. Of course, men of any age were entitled to flake around the place giving digs to anyone who looked like they might slight them, and that was certainly how the wreck behaved: hollow but for hot, cheap rage, dancing between glory and drying-out sessions in miserable rehab centres a million miles from anywhere. Even when Ryan dredged up the frenzies required by teachers&#x2019; scorn or challenges thrown down by bigger kids, he knew there was something very empty in the way the lot of them encouraged him to fight. He&#x2019;d been on the lookout for something to dare him to get out of bed in the morning, but he&#x2019;d never thought it could have been her.<br><br>She was part of that group of girls who wore their skirts the shortest and who commandeered the radiator perches before every class and who could glide between impertinence and saccharine familiarity with teachers. He&#x2019;d never thought she would look at him as anything but a scrapper, though he&#x2019;d been asking her to, silently, behind his closed mouth and downturned eyes, for <i>fucking years</i>.<br><br>Three weeks before, on the night of his birthday, she had let him kiss her.<br><br>He&#x2019;d been in one of his friends&#x2019; cars&#x2014;they were older than him, contemporaries of his sixteen-year-old cousin Joseph, who knew enough about Ryan to excuse his age&#x2014;when he&#x2019;d spotted her standing outside the doors of the community centre disco, laughing and trembling in a long black top and white shorts. He&#x2019;d leaned up from the back seat and called her from the passenger window, and he didn&#x2019;t even have to coax to get her clambering in beside him. Dumb luck that she was in the mood for a spin. And yet, a leap in his chest that tempted him to believe that maybe it was more again: dumb luck and trust. She trusted him. She&#x2014;Jesus!&#x2014;<i>liked</i> him.<br><br>They&#x2019;d gone gatting. There were a couple of cans and a couple of joints and a cold, fair wind that brought her closer to his side. When he&#x2019;d realised he couldn&#x2019;t medicate the nerves, he&#x2019;d owned up to how&nbsp;he felt about her by chancing a hand left on the small of her back, counting to twenty or thirty or eighty before accepting she wasn&#x2019;t going to move away, taking her hand to steady his own and then finally, finally, over the great distance of thirty centimetres, he caught her mouth on his and kissed her.<br><br>In the days that followed they had covered miles of new ground and decided to chance making a go of it. They had gone to the pictures, they had eaten ice cream, they had meandered at the end of each meeting back to her road, holding hands. And lest they laid foundations too wholesome, they had found quiet spaces and dark corners in which to crumble that friendship, his palms recording the difference between the skin on her waist and on her breasts, his body pushing against hers so he could remember how her every hollow fit him.<br><br>Now, in his hall on a Monday lunchtime, he answered with a question.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want to do?&#x201d;<br><br>She stepped into the sitting room and spun on one foot, taking it all in. He didn&#x2019;t need to stick his head through the frame to know that the view was found wanting. His father&#x2019;s ineptitude had preserved the place as a museum to his mother&#x2019;s homemaking skills, and she had been as effective with clutter as the wind was with blades of grass.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been in your house,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s weird.&#x201d;<br><br>She meant her presence in it, and not the house itself. Though she wouldn&#x2019;t have been far wrong; it was weird. It was a three-bedroom terraced so cavernous without his mother he could barely stand it. It was a roof over his head. It was a fire hazard, in that he thought sometimes he could douse it in fuel and take a match to it and watch it take the night sky with it.<br><br>She knew the score. He&#x2019;d admitted his circumstances in a brave move only a couple of days before, terrified that she&#x2019;d lose it and&nbsp;dump him, and yet desperate to tell her that not every rumour about his father was true. On the back steps of the school, curled together on cold concrete, he&#x2019;d confessed that yeah, he clashed with his dad, but no, not in the way that some of the more spiteful storytellers hinted at.<i> He&#x2019;s an eejit, girl, there&#x2019;s only the weight in him to stay upright when he&#x2019;s saturated, but he&#x2019;s not . . . He&#x2019;s . . . I&#x2019;ve heard shit that people have said but he&#x2019;s not warped, girl. He&#x2019;s just . . . fucking . . . I don&#x2019;t know.</i><br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t run off and she hadn&#x2019;t told anyone. It was both a load off and the worst play he could have made, for it cemented his place on his belly on the ground in front of her. On one hand he didn&#x2019;t mind because he knew she was better than him&#x2014;she was whip-smart and as beautiful as morning and each time he saw her he felt with dizzying clarity the blood in his veins and the air in his lungs and his heart beating strong in his chest&#x2014;but then it pissed him off that he couldn&#x2019;t approach her on his own two feet. That he was no more upright now than his father. That uselessness was hereditary.<br><br>There was no anger now, though. He had left it outside the front door with his wilting remains.<br><br>She held out her hand for his.<br><br>&#x201c;You gonna play for me?&#x201d;<br><br>His mam&#x2019;s piano stood by the wall, behind the door. It could just as easily have been his. He&#x2019;d put the hours in, while she fought with his dad or threatened great career changes or fought with the neighbours or threatened to gather him and his siblings and stalk back to her parents. She used to pop him onto the piano stool whenever she needed space to indulge her cranky fancies, and in so doing had left him with ambidexterity and the ability to read sheet music. Not many people knew that about him, because they&#x2019;d never have guessed.<br><br>He could play for Karine D&#x2019;Arcy, if he wanted to. Some classical piece he could pretend was more than just a practice exercise, or maybe one of the pop songs his mother had taught him when she was finding sporadic employment with wedding bands and singing&nbsp;in hotel lobbies during shitty little arts festivals. It might even work. Karine might be so overwhelmed that she might take all her clothes off and let him fuck her right there on the sitting-room floor.<br><br>Something empty about that fantasy, too. The reality is that she was here in his house on a Monday lunchtime, a million zillion years from morphing into a horny stripper. That&#x2019;s what he had to deal with: Karine D&#x2019;Arcy really-really being here.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t want to play for her. Anticipation would make knuckles of his fingertips.<br><br>&#x201c;I might do later,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Later?&#x201d;<br><br>He might have looked deep into her eyes and crooned Yeah, later, if he&#x2019;d had more time to get used to his new frame. Instead he smiled and looked away and muddled together Later and After in his head. I might do After. We have this whole house to ourselves to make better. There was going to be an After. He knew it.<br><br>She walked past him and out into the kitchen, and looked out the back window at the garden and its dock-leafed lawn laid out between stubby walls of concrete block. She flexed her hands against the sink, and pushed back her shoulders as she stretched onto tiptoes.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s weird,&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;To have never been in this house until now. You and me have been friends for so long, like.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been an anxious kind of friendship. There were school projects and parties and play-fighting and one time a real fight during which he had accused her of only hanging out with him to get access to those parties. It was during that outburst of impotent temper, between off-white walls in a wide school corridor, that he realised their closeness amounted to years of her dragging him along like a piece of broken rock in a comet&#x2019;s tail.<br><br>It hit him like a midwife&#x2019;s slap that if it wasn&#x2019;t for his house being so cavernous, if it wasn&#x2019;t for his dad traipsing the city looking for cheap drink and indifferent company, if it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact&nbsp;that scrappers cared little for mitching off school, she wouldn&#x2019;t be here with him now, offering him the possibility of removing the burden of friendship and at least some of his clothes. Karine D&#x2019;Arcy looked back at him with one hand on the draining board. The house looked different with her here, on his side. She didn&#x2019;t know the history in every room and every jagged edge. The bottom step of the stairs. The coffee table that was always there, just so, to trip him up whenever he was shoved into the front room. The kitchen wall, the spot by the back door, where he&#x2019;d watched the light switch from an inch away with one cheek pressed against eggshell blue and his dad&#x2019;s weight condensed into a hand flat on his left temple trying to push him right through the plaster.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re beautiful,&#x201d; he told her, and she laughed and blinked and said, &#x201c;God, where did that come from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>She nestled against his neck. Missing Geography, she might have said. But she didn&#x2019;t say anything and the longer her silence went on the closer they got to the stairs, to his bed, to whatever came after that.<br><br>He hated his bedroom marginally less than he hated the rest of the house. He shared it with his brothers Cian and Cathal, who were messier than he was. The space was laid out in a Venn diagram; no matter how loudly he roared or how gingerly he protected what was his from what was theirs, they always managed to arrange an overlap.

They lay on his bed and held each other, and kissed, and more clothes came off, and all the way along he kept thinking that she was going to withdraw her approval, that his hands would betray him here as he worried they would on the piano keys.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t. She kissed him back and pressed against him and helped him. And he wondered if he could do this with her in every room would it sanctify the place, exorcise it of the echoes of words spat and fists thrown?<br><br>He wondered if he should stop wondering, when a wandering mind was heresy.<br><br>&#x201c;Just be careful,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Oh please, Ryan, be careful.&#x201d;<br><br>She clasped her hands around his neck and he found his right hand on her left knee, gently pushing out and oh fuck, that was it, he was totally done for.<br><br>Cork City isn&#x2019;t going to notice the first brave steps of a resolute little man.

When the grisly remains of two other women are found, it becomes clear to Maura and Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli that a maniac is at large. Now Maura and Jane must unravel a murderer&#x2019;s twisted endgame before the Archaeology Killer adds another chilling artifact to his monstrous collection.</p><p><i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author&nbsp;<b>Tess Gerritsen</b>&nbsp;earned international acclaim for her first novel of suspense,&nbsp;<i>Harvest</i>. She introduced detective Jane Rizzoli in&nbsp;<i>The Surgeon</i>&nbsp;(2001) and Dr. Maura Isles in&nbsp;<i>The Apprentice</i>&nbsp;(2002) and has gone on to write numerous other titles in the celebrated Rizzoli &amp; Isles series, including&nbsp;<i>The Mephisto Club, The Keepsake, Ice Cold, The Silent Girl, Last to Die,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Die Again.&nbsp;</i>Her latest novel is the standalone thriller&nbsp;<i>Playing with Fire.</i>&nbsp;A physician, Tess Gerritsen lives in Maine.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>He is coming for me.<br><br>&nbsp;I feel it in my bones. I sniff it in the air, as recognizable&nbsp;as the scent of hot sand and savory spices&nbsp;and the sweat of a hundred men toiling in the sun.&nbsp;These are the smells of Egypt&#x2019;s western desert, and&nbsp;they are still vivid to me, although that country is&nbsp;nearly half a globe away from the dark bedroom&nbsp;where I now lie. Fifteen years have passed since I&nbsp;walked that desert, but when I close my eyes, in an&nbsp;instant I am there again, standing at the edge of the&nbsp;tent camp, looking toward the Libyan border and&nbsp;the sunset. The wind moaned like a woman when it&nbsp;swept down the wadi. I still hear the thuds of pickaxes&nbsp;and the scrape of shovels, can picture the&nbsp;army of Egyptian diggers, busy as ants as they&nbsp;swarmed the excavation site, hauling their gufa&nbsp;baskets filled with soil. It seemed to me then, when&nbsp;I stood in that desert fifteen years ago, as if I were&nbsp;an actress in a film about someone else&#x2019;s adventure.&nbsp;Not mine. Certainly it was not an adventure that a&nbsp;quiet girl from Indio, California, ever expected to&nbsp;live.&nbsp;<br><br>The lights of a passing car glimmer through my&nbsp;closed eyelids. When I open my eyes, Egypt vanishes.&nbsp;No longer am I standing in the desert gazing&nbsp;at a sky smeared by sunset the color of bruises. Instead&nbsp;I am once again half a world away, lying in&nbsp;my dark San Diego bedroom.&nbsp;<br><br>I climb out of bed and walk barefoot to the window&nbsp;to look out at the street. It is a tired neighborhood&nbsp;of stucco tract homes built in the 1950s, before&nbsp;the American dream meant mini-mansions and&nbsp;three- car garages. There is honesty in the modest&nbsp;but sturdy houses, built not to impress but to shelter,&nbsp;and I feel safely anonymous here. Just another&nbsp;single mother struggling to raise a recalcitrant&nbsp;teenage daughter.&nbsp;<br><br>Peeking through the curtains at the street, I see a&nbsp;dark- colored sedan slow down half a block away.&nbsp;It pulls over to the curb, and the headlights turn&nbsp;off. I watch, waiting for the driver to step out, but&nbsp;no one does. For a long time the driver sits there.&nbsp;Perhaps he&#x2019;s listening to the radio, or maybe he&#x2019;s&nbsp;had a fight with his wife and is afraid to face her.&nbsp;Perhaps there are lovers in that car with nowhere&nbsp;else to go. I can formulate so many explanations,&nbsp;none of them alarming, yet my skin is prickling with&nbsp;hot dread.&nbsp;<br><br>A moment later the sedan&#x2019;s taillights come back&nbsp;on, and the car pulls away and continues down the&nbsp;street.&nbsp;<br><br>Even after it vanishes around the corner, I am still&nbsp;jittery, clutching the curtains in my damp hand. I&nbsp;return to bed and lie sweating on top of the covers,&nbsp;but I cannot sleep. Although it&#x2019;s a warm July night,&nbsp;I keep my bedroom window latched, and insist that&nbsp;my daughter, Tari, keeps hers latched as well. But&nbsp;Tari does not always listen to me.&nbsp;<br><br>Every day, she listens to me less.<br><br>&nbsp;I close my eyes and, as always, the visions of Egypt&nbsp;come back. It&#x2019;s always to Egypt that my thoughts return.&nbsp;Even before I stood on its soil, I&#x2019;d dreamed&nbsp;about it. At six years old, I spotted a photograph of&nbsp;the Valley of the Kings on the cover of <i>National Geographic,&nbsp;</i>feeling instant recognition, as though I&nbsp;were looking at a familiar, much- beloved face that&nbsp;I had almost forgotten. That was what the land&nbsp;meant to me, a beloved face I longed to see again.&nbsp;And as the years progressed, I laid the foundations&nbsp;for my return. I worked and studied. A full scholarship&nbsp;brought me to Stanford, and to the attention&nbsp;of a professor who enthusiastically recommended&nbsp;me for a summer job at an excavation in Egypt&#x2019;s&nbsp;western desert.&nbsp;<br><br>In June, at the end of my ju nior year, I boarded a&nbsp;flight to Cairo.&nbsp;Even now, in the darkness of my California bedroom,&nbsp;I remember how my eyes ached from the&nbsp;sunlight glaring on white- hot sand. I smell the sunscreen&nbsp;on my skin and feel the sting of the wind&nbsp;peppering my face with desert grit. These memories&nbsp;make me happy. With a trowel in my hand and the&nbsp;sun on my shoulders, this was the culmination of a&nbsp;young girl&#x2019;s dreams.&nbsp;<br><br>How quickly dreams become nightmares. I&#x2019;d&nbsp;boarded the plane to Cairo as a happy college student.&nbsp;Three months later, I returned home a changed&nbsp;woman.&nbsp;<br><br>I did not come back from the desert alone. A&nbsp;monster followed me.&nbsp;<br><br>In the dark, my eyelids spring open. Was that a&nbsp;footfall? A door creaking open? I lie on damp&nbsp;sheets, heart battering itself against my chest. I am&nbsp;afraid to get out of bed, and afraid not to.&nbsp;<br><br>Something is not right in this house.&nbsp;<br><br>After years of hiding, I know better than to ignore&nbsp;the warning whispers in my head. Those urgent&nbsp;whispers are the only reason I am still alive. I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;learned to pay heed to every anomaly, every tremor&nbsp;of disquiet. I notice unfamiliar cars driving up my&nbsp;street. I snap to attention if a co- worker mentions&nbsp;that someone was asking about me. I make elaborate&nbsp;escape plans long before I ever need them. My&nbsp;next move is already planned out. In two hours, my&nbsp;daughter and I can be over the border and in Mexico&nbsp;with new identities. Our passports, with new&nbsp;names, are already tucked away in my suitcase.&nbsp;We should have left by now. We should not have&nbsp;waited this long.&nbsp;<br><br>But how do you convince a fourteen- year- old girl&nbsp;to move away from her friends? Tari is the problem;&nbsp;she does not understand the danger we&#x2019;re in.&nbsp;I pull open the nightstand drawer and take out the gun. It is not legally registered, and it makes me&nbsp;ner vous, keeping a firearm under the same roof with&nbsp;my daughter. But after six weekends at the shooting&nbsp;range, I know how to use it.&nbsp;<br><br>My bare feet are silent as I step out of my room&nbsp;and move down the hall, past my daughter&#x2019;s closed&nbsp;door. I conduct the same inspection that I have made&nbsp;a thousand times before, always in the dark. Like&nbsp;any prey, I feel safest in the dark.&nbsp;<br><br>In the kitchen, I check the windows and the door.&nbsp;In the living room, I do the same. Everything is secure.&nbsp;I come back up the hall and pause outside my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom. Tari has become fanatical&nbsp;about her privacy, but there is no lock on her door,&nbsp;and I will never allow there to be one. I need to be&nbsp;able to look in, to confirm that she is safe.&nbsp;<br><br>The door gives a loud squeak as I open it, but it&nbsp;won&#x2019;t wake her. As with most teenagers, her sleep is&nbsp;akin to a coma. The first thing I notice is the breeze,&nbsp;and I give a sigh. Once again, Tari has ignored my&nbsp;wishes and left her window wide open, as she has so&nbsp;many times before.&nbsp;<br><br>It feels like sacrilege, bringing the gun into my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom, but I need to close that window.&nbsp;I step inside and pause beside the bed, watching&nbsp;her sleep, listening to the steady rhythm of her&nbsp;breathing. I remember the first time I laid eyes on&nbsp;her, red- faced and crying in the obstetrician&#x2019;s&nbsp;hands. I had been in labor eigh teen hours, and was&nbsp;so exhausted I could barely lift my head from the&nbsp;pillow. But after one glimpse of my baby, I would&nbsp;have risen from bed and fought a legion of attackers&nbsp;to protect her. That was the moment I knew&nbsp;what her name would be. I thought of the words&nbsp;carved into the great temple at Abu Simbel, words&nbsp;chosen by Ramses the Great to proclaim his love for&nbsp;his wife.&nbsp;<br><br>Nefertari, for whom the sun doth shine&nbsp;<br><br>My daughter, Nefertari, is the one and only trea -&nbsp;sure that I brought back with me from Egypt. And&nbsp;I am terrified of losing her.&nbsp;<br><br>Tari is so much like me. It&#x2019;s as if I am watching&nbsp;myself sleeping. When she was ten years old, she&nbsp;could already read hieroglyphs. At twelve, she could&nbsp;recite all the dynasties down to the Ptolemys. She&nbsp;spends her weekends haunting the Museum of&nbsp;Man. She is a clone of me in every way, and as the&nbsp;years pass there is no obvious trace of her father in&nbsp;her face or her voice or, most important of all, her&nbsp;soul. She is my daughter, mine alone, untainted by&nbsp;the evil that fathered her.&nbsp;<br><br>But she is also a normal fourteen- year- old girl,&nbsp;and this has been a source of frustration these past&nbsp;weeks as I&#x2019;ve felt darkness closing in around us, as&nbsp;I lie awake every night, listening for a monster&#x2019;s&nbsp;footsteps. My daughter is oblivious to the danger&nbsp;because I have hidden the truth from her. I want&nbsp;her to grow up strong and fearless, a warrior&nbsp;woman who is unafraid of shadows. She does not&nbsp;understand why I pace the house late at night, why&nbsp;I latch the windows and double- check the doors.&nbsp;She thinks I am a worrywart, and it&#x2019;s true: I do all&nbsp;the worrying for both of us, to preserve the illusion&nbsp;that all is right with the world.&nbsp;<br><br>That is what Tari believes. She likes San Diego and&nbsp;she looks forward to her first year in high school.&nbsp;She&#x2019;s managed to make friends here, and heaven&nbsp;help the parent who tries to come between a teenager&nbsp;and her friends. She is as strong- willed as I am, and&nbsp;were it not for her re sis tance, we would have left&nbsp;town weeks ago.&nbsp;<br><br>A breeze blows in the window, chilling the sweat&nbsp;on my skin.&nbsp;<br><br>I set the gun down on the nightstand and cross&nbsp;to the window to close it. For a moment I linger,&nbsp;breathing in cool air. Outside, the night has fallen&nbsp;silent, except for a mosquito&#x2019;s whine. A prick stings&nbsp;my cheek. The significance of that mosquito bite&nbsp;does not strike me until I reach up to slide the window&nbsp;shut. I feel the icy breath of panic rush up my&nbsp;spine.&nbsp;<br><br>There is no screen over the window. <i>Where is the&nbsp;screen?&nbsp;</i><br><br>Only then do I sense the malevolent presence.&nbsp;While I stood lovingly watching my daughter, <i>it </i>was&nbsp;watching me. It has always been watching, biding&nbsp;its time, waiting for its chance to spring. Now it has&nbsp;found us.&nbsp;<br><br>I turn and face the evil.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Return of the Thin Man: Two never-before-published novellas featuring Nick &amp; Nora Charles</h2><p>Dashiell Hammett was a crime writer who elevated the genre to true literature, and <i>The Thin Man</i> was Hammett's last&#x2014;and most successful&#x2014;novel.

Each selection of<i> Fabulae Syrae </i>corresponds to a chapter in<i> Familia Romana,</i> allowing you to read stories that are perfectly on grade level, and thereby rapidly build comprehension and confidence as you enjoy the adventures of men and mischief of gods.<br><br>The collection begins with the adventure of Pygmalion, the Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory, and ends with nearly 200 verses of original Latin from books two and three of Ovid&#x2019;s Metamorphoses. The vignettes are annotated with helpful margin notes and are accompanied by beautiful historic woodcut illustrations.

Mining the Hermetic, alchemical, and Neoplatonic influences behind the evolution of the deck, author Robert M.

He presents techniques that offer new and valuable ways to read and interpret the cards.

Well-researched, entertainingly written chapters begin the book with information on where the tarot comes from and how it gained so much prominence as a tool for divination. Far from developing from deeply magical sources, as many have claimed, the tarot was originally just a deck of cards used for playing games. Even at the start, however, those games included some fortune-telling. Over the course of centuries, the cards' lore was enriched by thoughtful practitioners who added cards, elaborated their meanings, and connected their imagery to mythology and dreams. At the beginning of the twentieth century, an inspired young artist, Pamela Smith, drew upon her occult training and her own visions to create the now classic Rider-Waite deck. In a comprehensively researched and passionately argued chapter, Place restores Smith to her rightful position as the genius behind the deck. That Place also offers excellent guidance to actually reading the cards makes the book that much more appealing, as a how-to as well as a why-bother. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It's a seminal work in the development of Buddhism throughout East Asia and, by extension, in the development of Mahayana Buddhism throughout the world. Taking place in a vast and fantastical cosmic setting, the Lotus Sutra places emphasis on skillfully doing whatever is needed to serve and compassionately care for others, on breaking down distinctions between the fully enlightened buddha and the bodhisattva who vows to postpone salvation until all beings may share it, and especially on each and every being's innate capacity to become a buddha.<br><br>Gene Reeves's new translation appeals to readers with little or no familiarity with technical Buddhist vocabulary, as well as long-time practitioners and students. In addition, this remarkable volume includes the full "threefold" text of this classic.</p><p>Gene Reeves is a Buddhist scholar and teacher, process philosopher, and theologian who has lived in Tokyo for over 23 years studying, teaching, and practicing the Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra. He is a founder of the International Buddhist Congregation with headquarters in Tokyo, a part of the much larger Rissho Kosei-kai lay Buddhist organization. He is the translator from Chinese into English of <i>The Lotus Sutra: A Contemporary Translation of a Buddhist Classic</i>. His most recently published book is <i>The Stories of the Lotus Sutra</i>. A Buddhist Kaleidoscope: Essays on the Lotus Sutra, which he edited, was published in 2002. He retired in 2012 as distinguished professor at Renmin University of China in Beijing and continues to do field research on contemporary Chinese Buddhism in China and serve as an International Advisor at Rissho Kosei-kai in Japan. He has taught at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, the University of Peking in China, and at the University of Chicago and Meadville Lombard Theological School, Wilberforce University, and Tufts University in the United States. Born and raised in a small factory town in New Hampshire, Reeves graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in psychology, from Boston University with a degree in theology, and from Emory University with a PhD in philosophy. In addition to his passion for Buddhism, Reeves has been active for over 50 years in civil rights causes, working for a time with Martin Luther King, Jr. and for Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. Reeves is married to Yayoi Reeves and has homes in Tokyo and Chicago. He has two adult daughters who live and work in the United States."Difficult as it may be to interpret ancient Tibetan Buddhist imagery for contemporary meditators, it is perhaps even more challenging to make historical Buddhist texts accessible. In a new translation of <i>The Lotus Sutra</i>, Gene Reeves aims to do just this. Reeves uses everyday language wherever possible, translating into English many words that previous works have left in Sanskrit. This approach is particularly appropriate for the Lotus Sutra, which emphasizes that enlightenment is attainable for everyone." Source: Tricycle<br><br>"This translation is immediately the new standard, expressing the Lotus Sutra with accuracy, clarity, and fresh readability. The text's genius and subtle spiritual teachings are skillfully captured for a wide audience." Author: Taigen Dan Leighton, Loyola University, author of Visions of Awakening Space and Time: Dogen and the Lotus Sutra<br><br>"A highly readable new translation of the great Lotus Sutra, Gene Reeves skillfully renders the complexity of the text from a scholarly standpoint while delivering its flavor for practitioners. An invaluable resource for students in the classroom as well as in the meditation hall." Author: Mark Unno, University of Oregon, author of Shingon Refractions<br><br>"For readers who are not familiar with the Lotus Sutra, this is an excellent opportunity to acquaint oneself with a bedrock Mahayana text. Dr. Reeves brings a welcome perspective of both scholarship and sympathy to the text, which is extremely multifaceted and requires flexibility to fully represent its fascinating-and at times somewhat frustrating-elements. This new version is also particularly important because it includes the rarely translated Sutra of Innumerable Meanings and the Sutra of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, which are traditionally considered to be the preface and appendix of the main text and hold an important place in the liturgy and study of the Lotus Sutra. And Dr. Reeves has made a strong effort to make the text truly accessible to anyone, including non-Buddhists and non-specialists."

In <i>The Hoarder in You, </i>Dr. Zasio shares behind-the-scenes stories from the show, including some of the most serious cases of hoarding that she's encountered-and explains how readers can learn from these extreme examples. She also shares psychological and practical advice for de-cluttering and organizing, including how to tame the emotional pull of acquiring additional things, make order out of chaos by getting a handle on cluter, and create an organizational system that reduces stress and anxiety.</p><p>ROBIN ZASIO, PsyD, LCSW, is a featured doctor on the hit A&amp;E series <i>Hoarders</i> and specializes in treating hoarding and other anxiety-related disorders. She lives in Sacramento, CA.CHAPTER 1<br><br>PACK RATS, CLUTTERERS, AND COMPULSIVE HOARDERS<br><br>YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED that Joan suffered from compulsive hoarding. When I first met her at my office in Sacramento, I saw an impeccably dressed African American woman of 50, who I knew from the referral was a highly regarded administrator at an insurance company, the model of efficiency and attention to detail at work for 2 decades.<br><br>The first time I saw her home, however, was a very different story. Joan was at Level 4 (out of 5) on the Clutter Hoarding Scale, an assessment tool devised by the National Study Group of Chronic Disorganization (NSGCD) in St. Louis. In broad terms, someone at Level 4 would have significant difficulty cleaning a home without professional help; conditions of the home are unsanitary or otherwise hazardous (food is often rotting on counters, and rodents and insects may be visible in multiple locations); rooms in the home are so packed with objects that they are unusable for their original purpose; there's mold and structural damage to the home; and when pets are present, there is accumulated animal waste. Joan's house met all of these conditions. It was hard to imagine that this calm, confident woman could emerge every day from such a place.<br><br>The first thing I noticed about Joan's house was the smell. Even with my impaired sense of smell, the odor of ammonia and feces was overwhelming. The cats' litter box, which was in the dining room, was overflowing, but a walk through the house made it clear that the two cats had long since given up on it and were urinating and defecating everywhere. Joan's three bedrooms were unusable--piles of clothes and books, many contaminated with cat waste, were everywhere, and disorganized to-do piles of bills, receipts, and laundry covered the living room.<br><br>In the kitchen, the counters were piled with old food and dirty, empty food containers. Canned goods and packaged foods overflowed from the pantry because Joan had bought multiples of the same items. The freezer was so full that it had frozen shut. Gnats flew everywhere. When I pulled open the freezer door and peered inside, I saw countless dead insects that had somehow worked their way into the seal. I pointed this out to Joan, who didn't seem terribly bothered by it; she said something vague about meaning to call the exterminator.<br><br>I'd seen worse homes in my years of treating people who hoard, but what I remember most about Joan's house is the plastic bags filled with cat feces that were sitting by the litter box, leaning up against the sliding glass door to the backyard. Apparently, Joan would scoop the contents of the litter box into the bag, intend to place the bags into the garbage, and either forget or find herself unable to lift it. She said she was always meaning to call someone to help her throw it out, but she never did. As a result, bags of cat waste sat in the living room. Joan, like many who compulsively hoard, had a system, albeit one that didn't work well. She was full of good intentions, but the time to take care of all the things she meant to simply never came. There were always, as with many of us, more important things to do.<br><br>Joan's case exemplifies to me many of the things people don't understand about hoarding. Many people judge hoarders harshly, believing them to be lazy, unsanitary, uncaring, selfish, self-absorbed, or narcissistic.* Joan's personality couldn't be further from any of these traits. She was desperate to live differently--she just didn't know how--and she needed help. Joan completed the 6-week Intensive Outpatient Program at my clinic, which involves extensive hours of therapy and home visits. While her home wasn't perfectly free of clutter when she was discharged from the program, she now lives a very different life than she did before treatment. She currently works with a therapist one-on-one, and she continues to improve.<br><br>In my practice and on the A&amp;E show <i>Hoarders</i>, I work with people like Joan, who suffer from compulsive hoarding, an anxiety condition in which individuals are simply unable to prevent themselves from accumulating and saving oftentimes shocking amounts of stuff, most of which an outside observer would consider useless garbage. Some 3 million people in this country are thought to compulsively hoard, but I believe that number is a gross underestimate due to the shame, guilt, embarrassment, and fear that prevent many people from seeking help.<br><br>In extreme hoarding situations, people may live in squalor, with conditions so unsanitary and hazardous that their physical safety and that of their loved ones and pets is at risk. I have seen contamination from food, garbage, and human and animal waste eat through the walls and floorboards of a home, leaving gaping holes and wood riddled with insects. It's difficult to imagine how someone could think a platter of food with visible mold could ever be worth saving.<br><br>You have likely heard of the legendary Collyer brothers, two wealthy eccentrics who were found dead in their brownstone by New York City police and firemen in 1947 amidst their 130 tons of belongings. (E. L. Doctorow novelized their lives in a book released in 2009, and for years, mothers in New York City cited their example--"You don't want to wind up like the Collyer brothers, do you?"--to motivate their children to clean their rooms.) Extreme and sometimes tragic cases of compulsive hoarding continue to be reported regularly. Just last year, a Las Vegas woman who was reported missing by her husband was found dead 4 months later in her own home, buried under a pile of her belongings. Law enforcement and investigators had searched the place several times. "For our dogs to go through that house and not find something should be indicative of the tremendous environmental challenges they faced," a police spokesperson said. It is impossible to walk into a home like that and not wonder, "How did things get this bad, and how can a person live this way?"<br><br>The answer is complicated, as complicated as the minds of people who suffer from compulsive hoarding, a condition that can lead to severe isolation, depression, and physical degeneration, as well as interfere with someone's ability to earn a living and function in society. One reason people can live like that for so long is because they become habituated to their environment. That is, they simply get used to it--they adjust, accommodate to it, and work around the obstacles. Randy O. Frost, PhD, who studies compulsive hoarding at Smith College, calls this symptom clutter blindness. It's an apt term, because those who hoard often do not see what the rest of us do when we look at the same pile of stuff. They see lots of useful possessions or rooms that are "a bit disorganized," while we see complete chaos and mountains of randomly collected items. It is a problem of perception.<br><br>Sometimes it is not until an outsider comes in--be it a friend, someone like me who is there to help, or an agent from the state or county who is evaluating whether children or animals can live safely in a home--that the wall of denial that many hoarders have built around themselves can be broken down. Sometimes, but not always, they see the way they've been living through others' eyes and realize that their lives have spun out of control. On other occasions, sadly, they are unable to recognize the severity of their problem.<br><br>A CLUTTERED LIFE<br><br>I'm like many people in that I'm far more likely to want to give the bathroom an extra scrubbing, or perhaps finally go through that stack of junk mail on the side table, if I have company coming over. I am a very organized person, and somewhat private; I don't want the world to see my mess, the minutia of my life. I like to present a polished exterior, and my home is a reflection of that, by and large. Of course, a few piles that need to be sorted through, or even a crazy messy laundry room where random holiday decorations and outgrown bicycles are stored isn't a big deal, and many people have messy basements, garages, or attics where they keep things. Still, we can all do with less mess, and I think what we have in common with those who are compulsive hoarders is a large part of the appeal of the A&amp;E show <i>Hoarders</i>, and why there has been so much coverage of the condition in recent years. Fortunately, this media exposure has led many more people to seek treatment because they know that they are not alone.<br><br>I think the majority of us see a tiny bit of ourselves reflected in hoarders. And as you'll soon discover in the chapters to come, the way hoarders think about their possessions is in many ways not terribly different from the way non-hoarders approach the stuff in their lives. (For the purposes of this book, I will refer to people who are not suffering from compulsive hoarding, but who have a problem with clutter, as "non-hoarders" or sometimes "clutterers.") I can't tell you how many times I've asked my clients why they can't get rid of an individual item, and their answer is, "Because I'm afraid if I throw it out, I'll need it in the future." On other occasions I hear, "Because it would be wasteful to get rid of something that could still be used," or "It was such a good deal, I couldn't pass it up," or "This item was given to me by someone I love, and I don't feel right about throwing it out." Those are very common reasons to acquire or keep things--who doesn't think some version of those thoughts when going through his or her belongings?<br><br>What differentiates someone with this condition from a non-hoarder, of course, is that a hoarder is unable to take into account important factors like whether keeping an item may cause him more harm than good. The inability to make rational decisions about whether to keep things or let go of them; the degree of anxiety experienced when trying to sort through personal effects; and the sheer volume of belongings are all hallmarks of a compulsive hoarder. But the thought processes of a person on the far end of the hoarding spectrum and the thought processes of a person like me are not so different. While there are clinical differences between people who suffer from compulsive hoarding and those who are not struggling with this condition, when it comes to some of the behaviors and thought patterns, it is to some extent a matter of degree.<br><br>For that reason, I believe we can all benefit from gaining a better understanding of this condition and how it's treated, even if your home has only an average amount of clutter and mess. It's easy to see how clutter--even if it's not on the level of the Collyer brothers--can interfere with your life in very practical ways, and cause you to waste many hours of your week searching for things that you need. It can also make it difficult to be calm and present and enjoy your life to the fullest, and cause unnecessary stress and frustration.<br><br>Teresa's story perfectly illustrates how too much stuff can add stress to your life, even if you don't have an actual hoarding problem, but struggle with clutter, like so many more of us. A nurse and the mother of two boys, Teresa, age 43, is always panicked in the morning, no matter how early she sets her alarm. She allots sufficient time to shower and get her kids ready for school, but inevitably she can't find one essential item she needs before heading out the door. One day it's her sunglasses; another, it's her passport, which is required to complete a tax form at work. It's not uncommon for her husband to find Teresa, 5 minutes after she should have left to drop off the kids, dressed in her uniform, on her hands and knees, cursing like a sailor and searching through dust bunnies under her bed for the left shoe that matches the one on her right foot.<br><br>Teresa's house isn't terribly messy--just the usual explosion of stuff that comes with living with two sons and never having time to put things away properly--but it drives her batty. Teresa is a perfectionist: She can't think of the perfect place to put things, the perfect system to keep everything organized, so she procrastinates on organizing and frequently cannot find what she needs. More often than not, Teresa gives up, slips on a second-choice pair of shoes that she's not happy with, and races out the door. Once at school, her boys race from the car to their classrooms to beat the morning bell. Teresa sits in the parking lot, feeling frazzled and stressed, and applies her makeup in the rearview mirror.<br><br>If you asked Teresa if she likes her morning routine, she'd say no, but that she's too busy to constantly clean up, and the amount of stuff that a family of four requires is simply too much for her to keep under control. She does what she can to contain the chaos, but has largely surrendered to it. Frankly, she'd rather spend time with her kids and relax on the weekend than organize.<br><br>Still, living the way she does affects Teresa and her family on a daily basis--she's overwhelmed, often late, and never feels quite together. There's always something she should be doing to get her house in order, and it weighs on her, so she can't just relax at home after work. Every pile is a reminder of a job not yet done. If her house were in better shape and if she could find a way to function more efficiently within it, she would without a doubt be happier, and so would her family.<br><br>LEARNING FROM THE EXTREME CASES<br><br>Because we are all on a continuum of clutter, it can be helpful to know more about what compulsive hoarding is and how the condition manifests. Surprisingly, it was not until 1996 that psychologists Randy O. Frost and Tamara Hartl proposed a theoretical framework to describe hoarding. In their model, they suggested that people who hoard experience a combination of information-processing deficits, distorted beliefs about and emotional attachments to their possessions, and difficulty with organization.</p><h2>The Complete Illustrated Guide To Joinery</h2><p><p>There's no more thorough and readable guide to joinery than this new book from expert woodworker Gary Rogowski. <strong><em>The Complete Illustrated Guide to Joinery</em></strong> uses full-color, step-by-step photo essays to show you how to make every practical woodworking joint.</p> <p>Over 1,400 color photos and drawings illustrate the methods, from simple butt joints to angled tenons and complex scarf joints.

A former editor at <i>Wired,</i> Hale has written for numerous publications including the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> and <i>The Microsoft Network.</i> She has created maverick writing courses for people of all ages, including a popular seminar called "Grammar for Grownups," and currently teaches at U.C. Berkeley. She lives in Oakland, California.<b>Words</b><br><br>The French mime Etienne Decroux used to remind his students, "One pearl is better than a whole necklace of potatoes." What is true for that wordless art form applies equally to writing: well-crafted prose depends on the writer's ability to discriminate between pearls and potatoes. Only some words are fit to be strung into sentences.<br><br>Great writers are meticulous with their pearls, sifting through piles of words and stringing only perfect specimens upon the thread of syntax. The careful execution of beautiful, powerful prose through beautiful, powerful words is guided by these principles:<br><br><b>Relish every word.</b> True prose stylists carry on an impassioned, lifelong love affair with words, banishing bad words like so many banal suitors, burnishing the good ones till they shimmer. Be infatuated, be seduced, be obsessed.<br><br>But be smart about words, too. "All words are pegs to hang ideas on," wrote nineteenth-century essayist Henry Ward Beecher: words not linked to ideas are not worthy of writing-or reading. Once you've committed your words to paper (or to the screen), test each term. Does it carry your idea? Does it express, exactly, that once inchoate thought?<br><br>Sensitize yourself to denotation and connotation. Denotation, the dictionary definition of a word, refers to its explicit or literal meanings. Connotation, the suggestive power of a word, refers to its implicit or latent meanings. The denotations of peach (a single-seeded fruit with tangy yellowish pulp and downy skin that goes from yellow to red) and mango (a single-seeded fruit with a tangy yellowish pulp and firm skin mottled with greens, yellows, and reds) differ only slightly. But where peach summons up hot summers in Georgia and the cheeks of a Southern belle, mango conjures images of India and Mexico-and the paintings of Gauguin. The two fruits may be interchangeable in cooking, but wouldn't it be a mistake to swap in mango when writing about, say, the dusty peach chambres of a grande dame with a thing for Louis XVI?<br><br>Beyond the sense of a word is its sensuousness: its sound, its cadence, its spirit. In turning a phrase, let the words build like a jazz riff, allowing the meanings and melodies of one word to play off the meanings and melodies of the words around it.<br><br><b>Be simple, but go deep.</b> The exquisite "cutouts" of Matisse and elegant line drawings of Picasso came late in long careers of painstaking work and wild experimentation. In writing as in painting, simplicity often follows considerable torment. "People used to call me a good writer," mused John Ruskin, giant of the nineteenth-century essay. "Now they say I can't write at all; because, for instance, if I think anybody's house is on fire, I only say, 'Sir, your house is on fire.' . . . I used to say, 'Sir, the abode in which you probably passed the delightful days of youth is in a state of inflammation.' "<br><br>Verbose is not a synonym for literary. A member of the British Parliament once commented that if a bureaucrat had tried to express Lord Nelson's "England expects every man to do his duty," posterity would have been left with England anticipates that as regards the current emergency personnel will face up to the issues and exercise appropriately the functions allocated to their respective occupation groups. Bureaucrats and business writers too often prefer big, words when they're naming little things. Let's not forsake short, common words that name big things-hope and pride, for example-or simple couplings that leave concrete impressions, like the red wheelbarrow. Shakespeare's "sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care" uses simple words to go deep. No big-shot words, but a big idea.<br><br>It's not enough, though, to be just simple. "Nine pounds where three are sufficient is obesity," said Frank Lloyd Wright. "But to eliminate expressive words in speaking or writing-words that intensify or vivify meaning-is not simplicity. It may be, or usually is, stupidity."<br><br>Henry David Thoreau pored over Walden, revising it again and again to find words that "intensify or vivify meaning." This journal entry left him unsatisfied:<br><br>I have travelled some in New England, especially in Concord, and I found that no enterprise was on foot which it would not disgrace a man to take part in. They seemed to be employed everywhere in shops and offices and fields. They seemed, like the Brahmins of the East, to be doing penance in a thousand, curious, unheard-of ways.<br><br>Setting upon those sentences, clearing the unnecessary words and repetitions, Thoreau crafted a single sentence with greater power:<br><br>I have travelled a good deal in Concord, and everywhere, in shops and offices and fields; the inhabitants have seemed to me to be doing penance in a thousand curious ways.<br><br>Thoreau manages to make his idea more specific by panning right in on Concord, paring down his repetitions (they, initially repeated twice, is swept away by the stronger inhabitants), and cutting more quickly to the final, stirring phrase.<br><br><b>Take risks.</b> After having suffered the hyperactive red pens of schoolmarms and the hypercorrect rules of inflexible pedagogues, too many of us have retreated to the realm of the safe, the standard, and the vague. A "mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose," wrote George Orwell in "Politics and the English Language." "As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house."<br><br>Hidden in such prefab prose is a fear of going to the edge. But it's romping around on the fringes of language that gives writing its frisson. The right word might be snagged off the street, snatched from another language, or hatched in the sand tray of the imagination. Dive into the polyglot English tongue, taking a cue from Walt Whitman, that high priest of the rambunctious:<br><br>I like limber, lasting, fierce words. I like them applied to myself-and I like them in newspapers, courts, debates, Congress. Do you suppose the liberties and the brawn of These States have to do only with delicate lady-words? with gloved gentleman words? Bad presidents, bad judges, bad clients, bad editors, owners of slaves, and the long ranks of Northern political suckers (robbers, traitors, suborned), monopo lists, infidels, . . . shaved persons, supplejacks, ecclesiastics, men not fond of women, women not fond of men, cry down the use of strong, cutting, beautiful rude words. [But] to the manly instincts of the People they will be forever welcome.<br><br>Whitman's American English scarfs up words from other languages with a vengeance. If someone's bugging you, you can go the Anglo-Saxon route and shun her; or you can avoid her (Latin); or you can eschew her (French). Or you tell her to get outta your face. Don't shun slang, especially when it's vivid and musical and fills a gap in the lexicon. Think of the words Shakespeare invented: the adjectives long-haired, lackluster, unqualitied, green-eyed, heartsick, and hot-blooded, the nouns want-wit, vinegar aspect, and wit-snapper, and the verbs in lines like "You unlace your reputation thus" or "The tears that spanieled me at heels." More modern neologists have kept up the mischief, giving us gems like snafu, snarky, muckety-mucks, chump change, copacetic, airhead, hacker, and, oh, babelicious.<br><br>A word not in the dictionary is not out of bounds. Isn't the newly popular noun bloviator perfect to describe that dude who can't get enough of his own voice? H. L. Mencken carried on about coinages bubbling up out of the American experience; one of his favorites, rubberneck, he called "almost a complete treatise on American psychology . . . [conveying the] boldness and contempt for ordered forms that are so characteristically American . . . the grotesque humor of the country, the delight in devastating opprobriums, and the acute feeling for the succinct and savory."<br><br>You tell 'em, H.

But left to my own devices, I&#x2019;d prefer to skim over the events of the next few weeks, and whisk you through those days with glossed-over details that cast me in a more flattering light.<br><br>Nobody looks good in their darkest hour. But it&#x2019;s those hours that make us what we are. We stand strong, or we cower. We emerge victorious, tempered by our trials, or fractured by a permanent, damning fault line.<br><br>I never used to think about things like darkest hours and trials and fault lines.<br><br>I used to fill my days with sunning and shopping, bartending at The Brickyard (always more of a party than a job, and that was how I liked my life), and devising ways to con Mom and Dad into helping me buy a new car. At twenty-two, I was still living at home, safe in my sheltered world, lulled by the sleepy, slow-paddling fans of the Deep South into believing myself the center of it.<br><br>Then my sister, Alina, was brutally murdered while studying abroad in Dublin, and my world changed overnight. It was bad enough that I had to identify her mutilated body, and watch my once happy family shatter, but my world didn&#x2019;t stop falling apart there. It didn&#x2019;t stop until I&#x2019;d learned that pretty much everything I&#x2019;d been raised to believe about myself wasn&#x2019;t true.<br><br>I discovered that my folks weren&#x2019;t my real parents; my sister and I were adopted; and despite my lazy, occasionally overblown drawl, we weren&#x2019;t southern at all, but descended from an ancient Celtic bloodline of&nbsp;<i>sidhe</i>-seers, people who can see the Fae&#x2014;a terrifying race of otherworldly beings that have lived secretly among us for thousands of years, cloaked in illusions and lies.<br><br><i>Those&nbsp;</i>were the easy lessons.<br><br>The hard lessons were yet to come, waiting for me in the&nbsp;<i>craic</i>-filled streets of the Temple Bar District of Dublin, where I would watch people die, and learn to kill; where I would meet Jericho Barrons, V&#x2019;lane, and the Lord Master; where I would step up to the plate as a major player in a deadly game with fate of-the-world stakes.<br><br>For those of you just joining me, my name is MacKayla Lane, Mac for short. My real last name might be O&#x2019;Connor, but I don&#x2019;t know that for sure. I&#x2019;m a&nbsp;<i>sidhe</i>-seer, one of the most powerful that&#x2019;s ever lived. Not only can I see the Fae, I can hurt them and, armed with one of their most sacred Hallows&#x2014;the Spear of Luin, or Destiny&#x2014;I can even kill the immortal beings.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t settle into your chair and relax. It&#x2019;s not just my world that&#x2019;s in trouble; it&#x2019;s your world, too. It&#x2019;s happening, right now, while you&#x2019;re sitting there, munching a snack, getting ready to immerse yourself in a fictional escape. Guess what? It&#x2019;s not fiction, and there&#x2019;s no escape. The walls between the human world and Faery are coming down&#x2014;and I hate to break it to you, but these fairies are&nbsp;<i>so&nbsp;</i>not Tinkerbells.<br><br>If the walls crash completely...well, you&#x2019;d just better hope they don&#x2019;t. If I were you, I&#x2019;d turn on all my lights right now. Get out a few flashlights. Check your supply of batteries.<br><br>I came to Dublin for two things: to find out who killed my sister, and to get revenge. See how easily I can say that now? I want revenge. Revenge with a capital&nbsp;<i>R</i>. Revenge with crushed bones and a lot of blood. I want her murderer dead, preferably by my own hand. A few months here and I&#x2019;ve shed&nbsp;<i>years&nbsp;</i>of polished southern civilities.<br>Shortly after I stepped off the plane from Ashford, Georgia, and planted my well-pedicured foot on Ireland&#x2019;s shore, I probably would have died if I hadn&#x2019;t stumbled into a bookstore owned by Jericho Barrons. Who or what he is, I have no idea. But he has knowledge that I need, and I have something he wants, and that makes us reluctant allies.<br><br>When I had no place to turn, Barrons took me in, taught me who and what I am, opened my eyes, and helped me survive. He didn&#x2019;t do it nicely, but I no longer care how I survive, as long as I do.<br><br>Because it was safer than my cheap room at the inn, I moved in to his bookstore. It&#x2019;s protected against most of my enemies with wards and assorted spells, and stands bastion at the edge of what I call a Dark Zone: a neighborhood that has been taken over by Shades, amorphous Unseelie that thrive in darkness and suck the life from humans.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve battled monsters together. He&#x2019;s saved my life twice. We&#x2019;ve shared a taste of dangerous lust. He&#x2019;s after the<i>Sinsar Dubh</i>&#x2014;a million-year-old book of the blackest magic imaginable, scribed by the Unseelie King himself, that holds the key to power over both the worlds of Fae and Man. I want it because it was Alina&#x2019;s dying request that I find it, and I suspect it holds the key to saving our world.<br>He says he wants it because he collects books. Right.<br><br>V&#x2019;lane is another story. He&#x2019;s a Seelie prince, and a death-by-sex Fae, which you&#x2019;ll be learning more about soon enough. The Fae consist of two adversarial courts with their own Royal Houses and unique castes: the Light or Seelie Court, and the Dark or Unseelie Court. Don&#x2019;t let the light and dark stuff fool you. Both are deadly. However, the Seelie considered the Unseelie&nbsp;<i>so&nbsp;</i>deadly that they imprisoned them roughly seven hundred thousand years ago. When one Fae fears another, be afraid.<br><br>Each court has their Hallows, or sacred objects of immense power. The Seelie Hallows are the spear (which I have), the sword, the stone, and the cauldron. The Unseelie Hallows are the amulet (which I had and the Lord Master took), the box, the Sifting Silvers, and the highly sought-after Book. They all have different purposes. Some I know; others I&#x2019;m not so clear on.<br><br>Like Barrons, V&#x2019;lane is after the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh</i>. He&#x2019;s hunting it for the Seelie Queen Aoibheal, who needs it to reinforce the walls between the realms of Fae and Man, and keep them from coming down. Like Barrons, he has saved my life. (He&#x2019;s also given me some of the most intense orgasms of it.)<br><br>The Lord Master is my sister&#x2019;s murderer; the one who seduced, used, and destroyed her. Not quite Fae, not quite human, he&#x2019;s been opening portals between realms, bringing Unseelie&#x2014;the worst of the Fae&#x2014;through to our world, turning them loose, and teaching them to infiltrate our society. He&nbsp;<i>wants&nbsp;</i>the walls down so he can free all the Unseelie from their icy prison. He&#x2019;s also after the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh,&nbsp;</i>although I&#x2019;m not certain why. I think he may be seeking it to destroy it, so no one can ever rebuild the walls again.<br><br>That&#x2019;s where I come in.<br><br>These three powerful, dangerous men&nbsp;<i>need&nbsp;</i>me.<br><br>Not only can I see the Fae, I can sense Fae relics and Hallows. I can feel the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh&nbsp;</i>out there, a dark, pulsing heart of pure evil.<br><br>I can hunt it.<br><br>I can find it.<br><br>My dad would say that makes me this season&#x2019;s MVP.<br><br>Everybody wants me. So I stay alive in a world where death darkens my doorstep daily.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve seen things that would make your skin crawl. I&#x2019;ve done things that make my skin crawl.<br><br>But that&#x2019;s not important now. What&#x2019;s important is starting at the right place&#x2014;let&#x2019;s see...where was that?<br><br>I peel the pages of my memory backward, one at a time, squinting so I don&#x2019;t have to see them too clearly. I turn back, past that whiteout where all memories vanish for a time, past that hellish Halloween, and the things Barrons did. Past the woman I killed. Past a part of V&#x2019;lane piercing the meat of my tongue. Past what I did to Jayne.<br><br><i>There.</i><br><br>I zoom down into a dark, damp, shiny street.<br><br>It&#x2019;s me. Pretty in pink and gold.<br><br>I&#x2019;m in Dublin. It&#x2019;s nighttime. I&#x2019;m walking the cobbled pavement of Temple Bar. I&#x2019;m alive, vibrantly so. There&#x2019;s nothing like a recent brush with death to make you feel larger than life.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a sparkle in my eyes and a spring in my step. I&#x2019;m wearing a killer pink dress with my favorite heels, and I&#x2019;m accessorized to the hilt, in gold and rose amethyst. I&#x2019;ve taken extra care with my hair and makeup. I&#x2019;m on my way to meet Christian MacKeltar, a sexy, mysterious young Scotsman who knew my sister. I feel&nbsp;<i>good&nbsp;</i>for a change.<br><br>Well, at least for a short time I do.<br><br>Fast-forward a few moments.<br><br>Now I&#x2019;m clutching my head and stumbling from the sidewalk, into the gutter. Falling to all fours. I&#x2019;ve just gotten closer to the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh&nbsp;</i>than I&#x2019;ve ever been before, and it&#x2019;s having its usual effect on me. Pain. Debilitating.<br><br>I no longer look so pretty. In fact, I look positively wretched.<br><br>On my hands and knees in a puddle that smells of beer and urine, I&#x2019;m iced to the bone. My hair is in a tangle, my amethyst hair clip bobs against my nose, and I&#x2019;m crying. I push the hair from my face with a filthy hand and watch the tableau playing out in front of me with wide, horrified eyes.<br><br>I remember that moment. Who I was. What I wasn&#x2019;t. I capture it in freeze-frame. There are so many things I would say to her.<br><br>Head up, Mac. Brace yourself. A storm is coming. Don&#x2019;t you hear the thunderclap of sharp hooves on the wind? Can&#x2019;t you feel the soul-numbing frost? Don&#x2019;t you smell spice and blood on the breeze?<br><br>Run, I would tell her. Hide.<br><br>But I wouldn&#x2019;t listen to me.<br><br>On my knees, watching that...&nbsp;<i>thing...</i>do what it&#x2019;s doing, I&#x2019;m in the stranglehold of a killing undertow.<br><br>Reluctantly, I merge with the memory, slip into her skin...<b><i><br><br></i>One</b><br><br>The pain, God, the&nbsp;<i>pain</i>! It&#x2019;s going to splinter my skull!<br><br>I clutch my head with wet, stinking hands, determined to hold it together until the inevitable occurs&#x2014;I pass out.<br><br>Nothing compares to the agony the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh&nbsp;</i>causes me. Each time I get close to it, the same thing happens. I&#x2019;m immobilized by pain that escalates until I lose consciousness.<br><br>Barrons says it&#x2019;s because the Dark Book and I are point and counterpoint. That it&#x2019;s so evil, and I&#x2019;m so good, that it repels me violently. His theory is to &#x201c;dilute&#x201d; me somehow, make me a little evil so I can get close to it. I don&#x2019;t see how making me evil so I can get close enough to pick up an evil book is a good thing. I think I&#x2019;d probably do evil things with it.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I whimper, sloshing on my knees in the puddle. &#x201c;Please...no!&#x201d; Not here, not now! In the past, each time I&#x2019;d gotten close to the Book, Barrons had been with me, and I&#x2019;d had the comfort of knowing he wouldn&#x2019;t let anything too awful happen to my unconscious body. He might tote me around like a divining rod, but I could live with that. Tonight, however, I was alone. The thought of being vulnerable to anyone and anything in Dublin&#x2019;s streets for even a few moments terrified me. What if I passed out for an hour? What if I fell facedown into the vile puddle I was in, and drowned in mere inches of... ugh.<br><br>I&nbsp;<i>had&nbsp;</i>to get out of the puddle. I would not die so pathetically.<br><br>A wintry wind howled down the street, whipping between buildings, chilling me to the bone. Old newspapers cartwheeled like dirty, sodden tumbleweeds over broken bottles and discarded wrappers and glasses. I flailed in the sewage, scraped at the pavement with my fingernails, left the tips of them broken in gaps between the cobbled stones.<br><br>Inch by inch, I clawed my way to drier ground.<br><br>It was there&#x2014;straight ahead of me: the Dark Book. I could feel it, fifty yards from where I scrabbled for purchase. Maybe less. And it wasn&#x2019;t just a book. Oh, no. It was nothing that simple. It pulsated darkly, charring the edges of my mind.<br><br>Why wasn&#x2019;t I passing out?<br><br>Why wouldn&#x2019;t this pain&nbsp;<i>end</i>?<br><br>I felt like I was dying. Saliva flooded my mouth, frothing into foam at my lips. I wanted desperately to throw up but I couldn&#x2019;t. Even my stomach was locked down by pain.<br>Moaning, I tried to raise my head. I had to see it. I&#x2019;d been close to it before, but I&#x2019;d never&nbsp;<i>seen&nbsp;</i>it. I&#x2019;d always passed out first. If I wasn&#x2019;t going to lose consciousness, I had questions I wanted answered. I didn&#x2019;t even know what it looked like. Who had it? What were they doing with it? Why did I keep having near brushes with it?<br><br>Shuddering, I pushed back onto my knees, shoved a hank of sour-smelling hair from my face, and looked.<br><br>The street that only moments ago had bustled with tourists, making their merry way from one open pub door to the next, was now scourged clean by the dark, arctic wind. Doors had been slammed, music silenced.<br><br>Leaving only me.<br><br>And&nbsp;<i>them</i>.<br><br>The vision before me was not at all what I&#x2019;d expected.<br><br>A gunman had a huddle of people backed against the wall of a building, a family of tourists, cameras swinging around their necks. The barrel of a semiautomatic weapon gleamed in the moonlight. The father was yelling, the mother was screaming, trying to gather three small children into her arms.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I shouted. At least I think I did. I&#x2019;m not sure I actually made a sound. My lungs were compressed with pain.<br><br>The gunman let loose a spray of bullets, silencing their cries. He killed the youngest last&#x2014;a delicate blond girl of four or five, with wide, pleading eyes that would haunt me till the day I died. A girl I couldn&#x2019;t save because I couldn&#x2019;t fecking&nbsp;<i>move</i>. Paralyzed by pain-deadened limbs, I could only kneel there, screaming inside my head.<br><br>Why was this happening? Where was the&nbsp;<i>Sinsar Dubh</i>? Why couldn&#x2019;t I see it?<br><br>The man turned, and I inhaled sharply.<br><br>A book was tucked beneath his arm.<br><br>A perfectly innocuous hardcover, about three hundred and fifty pages thick, no dust jacket, pale gray with red binding. The kind of well-read hardcover you might find in any used bookstore, in any city.<br><br>I gaped. Was I supposed to believe&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>was the million-year-old book of the blackest magic imaginable, scribed by the Unseelie King? Was this supposed to be funny? How anticlimactic. How absurd.<br><br>The gunman glanced at his weapon with a bemused expression. Then his head swiveled back toward the fallen bodies, the blood and bits of flesh and bone spattered across the brick wall.<br><br>The book dropped from beneath his arm. It seemed to fall in slow motion, changing, transforming, as it tumbled, end over end, to the damp, shiny brick. By the time it hit the cobbled pavement with a heavy&nbsp;<i>whump,&nbsp;</i>it was no longer a simple hardcover but a massive black tome, nearly a foot thick, engraved with runes, bound by bands of steel and intricate locks. Exactly the kind of book I&#x2019;d expected: ancient and evil-looking.<br><br>I sucked in another breath.<br><br>Now the thick dark volume was changing again, becoming something new. It swirled and spun, drawing substance from wind and darkness.<br><br>In its place rose a...<i>thing...</i>of such...terrible essence and pitch. A darkly animate...again, I can only say&nbsp;<i>thing...</i>that existed beyond shape or name: A malformed creature sprung from some no-man&#x2019;s land of shattered sanity and broken gibberings.<br><br>And it&nbsp;<i>lived</i>.<br><br>I have no words to describe it, because nothing exists in our world to co...</p><h2>The New Testament You Never Knew Bible Study Guide: Exploring the Context, Purpose, and Meaning of the Story of God</h2><p><p>Do you know the real story behind the New Testament?</p><p>We all share a fascination for discovering &#x2018;the rest of the story.&#x2019; We enjoy learning the behind-the-scenes facts about seemingly familiar events.

In the authors' own words, this book was written to "help all people relate better to our Earth Mother...and find a kinship with the universe." <i>The Medicine Wheel</i> is a beautiful and inspiring approach to graceful, holistic living in trying modern times. <i>The Medicine Wheel</i>'s philosophy is derived from a basic principle known by all people who live close to the earth: Once you fully embrace the elemental forces of nature, you become a part of the whole. Let this book be your first step toward finding peace and prosperity -- and your own special place in the circle of life.</p><p>Sun Bear, a sacred teacher of Chippewa descent, is the founder and medicine chief of the Bear Tribe, a multiracial educational society.

He is publisher of the magazine <i>Wildfire</i> and founder of the World Earth Fund.<b>THE MOONS AND THE TOTEMS</b><br><br>The moon, or month, during which you were born determines your starting place on the Medicine Wheel and your beginning totem in the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. The first moon of the year, the Earth Renewal Moon, marks the time when the Father Sun returns from his journey to the south and begins, once again, to precipitate growth in the Earth Mother and all of her children. This moon begins at the time of the winter solstice, which usually occurs on December 22. This is the first moon of Waboose, Spirit Keeper of the North. It is followed by the Rest and Cleansing Moon and the Big Winds Moon. The moons of Waboose, those of rest and renewal, bring the time to contemplate the growth of the previous year and prepare for the growth of the year to come.<br><br>Following the moons of Waboose are those of Wabun, Spirit Keeper of the East. These three moons are those of awakening growth, when the Father Sun begins to illuminate all of earth's children and prepare them to bring forth their proper fruit. The first moon of Wabun is the Budding Trees Moon, which begins at the time of the spring equinox, which usually occurs on March 21. The other moons of Wabun are the Frogs Return Moon and the Complanting Moon. The moons of Wabun are those of illumination and wisdom, as earth's children prepare to grow in their proper way.<br><br>Next come the moons of Shawnodese, Spirit Keeper of the South. These are the moons of rapid growth, when all the earth comes to flower and bears fruit for that year. The Strong Sun Moon is the first one of Shawnodese and begins on June 21, the time of the summer solstice. It is followed by the Ripe Berries Moon and the Harvest Moon. This is the season of growth and trust. Trust is necessary in this season, since growth is so rapid there isn't time to ponder progress.<br><br>The autumn is the season of Mudjekeewis, Spirit Keeper of the West. The first moon of Mudjekeewis is the Ducks Fly Moon, which begins on September 23, the day of the autumn equinox. It is followed by the Freeze Up Moon and the Long Snows Moon. These are the moons that bring us the time of introspection, the time of gathering strength to look within and contemplate the growth and progress made in the preceding seasons. These are the times to prepare for the season of resting and renewing to come.<br><br>Each moon has a particular totem, or emblem, in the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms, which shares characteristics with the people who are born during this time. From your starting totems you will learn about yourselves, at the same time you learn more about your other relations on the earth. People do have a responsibility to their totems, to give them respect, liking and gratitude for the lessons and the energies they contribute to the continuation of life on our common Earth Mother.<br><br>As you travel around the wheel, you should strive to learn as much as you can about the totems of any place that you stand, so you are always growing more knowledgeable about those who share the earth with you. When you stand in the place of a different moon, you have the capacity to take on the characteristics of the totems for that moon and to learn from them, as well as from your fellow two-leggeds. The more you are willing to learn, the further you can travel on your journey around the Medicine Wheel.<br><br>Remember as you read of the moons that not all people will have all of the same characteristics, even though they share the same moon and totems. All travel the wheel at their own speed. It is possible, during the time you stand at one position, to sometimes have moods or phases that seem more fitting to those of another moon. These can remind you of positions through which you have passed or give you hints of the places you'll be traveling to next. The important message of the Medicine Wheel is that you allow yourself to keep traveling, rather than tying yourself to one position and blocking your energies from growing and changing.<br><br>Copyright � 1980 by Sun Bear and Wabun Bear</p><h2>English Victorian Poetry: An Anthology (Dover Thrift Editions: Poetry)</h2><p>Coinciding with the reign of Queen Victoria, the Victorian era of English literature is generally dated from the late 1930s to the turn of the 20th century and includes a roster of poets whose works are of perennial interest to students as well as enduringly popular with poetry lovers and other readers.<br> This outstanding, modestly priced anthology presents over 170 poems by the major poets of the period, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson; Robert Browning; Elizabeth Barrett Browning; Arthur Hugh Clough; Edward FitzGerald; Matthew Arnold; Dante Gabriel Rossetti; Christina Rossetti; Coventry Patmore; George Meredith; William Ernest Henley; Algernon Charles Swinburne; Gerard Manley Hopkins; Rudyard Kipling; and many others.<br> Carefully selected to include the works most often studied in literature courses, high school through college, this anthology is ideal for classroom use, independent study, and personal perusal.

What if you were never shown the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, weren't even told they existed? Alas, this is how math is taught, and so for most of us it becomes the intellectual equivalent of watching paint dry.<br>In <i>Love and Math</i>, renowned mathematician Edward Frenkel reveals a side of math we've never seen, suffused with all the beauty and elegance of a work of art. In this heartfelt and passionate book, Frenkel shows that mathematics, far from occupying a specialist niche, goes to the heart of all matter, uniting us across cultures, time, and space.<br>Love and Math tells two intertwined stories: of the wonders of mathematics and of one young man's journey learning and living it. Having braved a discriminatory educational system to become one of the twenty-first century's leading mathematicians, Frenkel now works on one of the biggest ideas to come out of math in the last 50 years: the Langlands Program. Considered by many to be a Grand Unified Theory of mathematics, the Langlands Program enables researchers to translate findings from one field to another so that they can solve problems, such as Fermat's last theorem, that had seemed intractable before.<br>At its core, <i>Love and Math</i> is a story about accessing a new way of thinking, which can enrich our lives and empower us to better understand the world and our place in it. It is an invitation to discover the magic hidden universe of mathematics.</p><p><b>Edward Frenkel</b> is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and was previously on the faculty at Harvard University.

In the tradition of his heroes Andre Weil and C. N. Yang, Edward Frenkel writes of the objective beauty of numbers. Like musical notes, they exist apart from the mind, daring us to fathom their depths and assemble them in arcane narratives that tell the story of us. Reading this book, one is compelled to drop everything and give math another try; to partake of the ultimate mystery."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Chris Carter, creator of <i>The X-Files</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Two fascinating narratives are interwoven in Love and Math, one mathematical, the other personal... Frenkel deftly takes the reader ... to the far reaches of our current understanding. He seeks to lay bare the beauty of mathematics for everyone.

He can go where the police cannot.</p><p>Together with his roguish friend, inspector Geordie Keating, Sidney inquires into the suspect suicide of a Cambridge solicitor, a scandalous jewelry theft at a New Year's Eve dinner party, the unexplained death of a jazz promoter's daughter, and a shocking art forgery that puts a close friend in danger.

Basic scientific terminology and detailed descriptions are interwoven with informal, sometimes humorous observations, facts, and ideas about life. The mechanisms, structure, and functions of the body are explored, along with how they relate to spiritual and energetic paradigms, emotions, and ecological principles. The first half of the book covers basic anatomy and physiology, describing each major system of the body and how they interrelate. This part includes a thoughtful discussion of aging and the dying process. The second half focuses on models of health and disease, both traditional and holistic. Topics include western pathology, emotional health, five element medicine, and the spiritual cause for disease.</p><p>Pip Waller is a medical herbalist, massage therapist, and plant spirit medicine and shamanic practitioner. She has taught at the Blarney Centre of Acupuncture and Reflexology in Ireland and currently teaches at the Academy of Natural Health in London and at the Meridian School of Massage in Birmingham. She lives in Wales, UK.&#x201c;Pip Waller's <i>Holistic Anatomy</i> is a welcome antidote to the outdated, nineteenth-century view of the human body as a series of replaceable mechanical parts. She joins with few others in beginning the necessary work of more accurately understanding the body as a closely coupled grouping of highly responsive, nonlinear organ systems. Such a change is essential to producing true healing for human beings rather than merely reducing symptoms and sending people on their way. It marks the movement toward a more human approach to healing, for this more accurate understanding of the human body moves us away from seeing people as organic machines and toward the ancient recognition that everything, including our bodies, is intelligent, alive, and aware.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Stephen Harrod Buhner, author of <i>The Lost Language of Plants: The Ecological Importance of Plant Medicines to Life on Earth </i>and<i> The Secret Teachings of Plants: The Intelligence of the Heart in the Direct Perception of Nature</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Holistic Anatomy</i> is a fascinating journey through the intricacies of the human body.

Pip Waller has a fantastic sense of humor, and the book is much more than a course in anatomy... Waller is warm and engaging and approaches many topics through her own lens... In short, this book is easy to read and reference and would complement any adult education anatomy course or home library.

They were farmers, and though they didn&#x2019;t own fancy things and lived in flimsy houses made of reeds, they were healthy and joyful and wanted for little. Food grew bountifully in their gardens, clean water ran in the streams, and even their humble homes seemed like luxuries because the weather in Swampmuck was so fair, and the villagers were so devoted to their work that many, after a long day of mucking, would simply lie down and sleep in their swamps.</p><p>Harvest was their favorite time of year. Working round the clock, they gathered the best weeds that had grown in the swamp that season, bundled them onto donkey carts, and drove their bounty to the market town of Chipping Whippet, a five days&#x2019; ride, to sell what they could. It was difficult work. The swampweed was rough and tore their hands. The donkeys were ill-tempered and liked to bite. The road to market was pitted with holes and plagued by thieves. There were often grievous accidents, such as when Farmer Pullman, in a fit of overzealous harvesting, accidentally scythed off his neighbor&#x2019;s leg. The neighbor, Farmer Hayworth, was understandably upset, but the villagers were such agreeable people that all was soon forgiven. The money they earned at market was paltry but enough to buy necessities and some rations of goat-rump besides, and with that rare treat as their centerpiece they threw a raucous festival that went on for days.</p><p>That very year, just after the festival had ended and the villagers were about to return to their toil in the swamps, three visitors arrived. Swampmuck rarely had visitors of any kind, as it was not the sort of place people wanted to visit, and it had certainly never had visitors like these: two men and a lady dressed head to toe in lush brocaded silk, riding on the backs of three fine Arabian horses. But though the visitors were obviously rich, they looked emaciated and swayed weakly in their bejeweled saddles.</p><p>The villagers gathered around them curiously, marveling at their beautiful clothes and horses.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too close!&#x201d; Farmer Sally warned. &#x201c;They look as if they might be sick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re on a journey to the coast of Meek,&#x201d; explained one of the visitors, a man who seemed to be the only one strong enough to speak. &#x201c;We were accosted by bandits some weeks ago, and, though we were able to outrun them, we got badly lost. We&#x2019;ve been turning circles ever since, looking for the old Roman Road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nowhere near the Roman Road,&#x201d; said Farmer Sally.</p><p>&#x201c;Or the coast of Meek,&#x201d; said Farmer Pullman.</p><p>&#x201c;How far is it?&#x201d; the visitor asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Six days&#x2019; ride,&#x201d; answered Farmer Sally.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never make it,&#x201d; the man said darkly.</p><p>At that, the silk-robed lady slumped in her saddle and fell to the ground.</p><p>The villagers, moved to compassion despite their concerns about disease, brought the fallen lady and her companions into the nearest house. They were given water and made comfortable in beds of straw, and a dozen villagers crowded around them offering help.</p><p>&#x201c;Give them space!&#x201d; said Farmer Pullman. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re exhausted; they need rest!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they need a doctor!&#x201d; said Farmer Sally.</p><p>&#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t sick,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re hungry. Our supplies ran out over a week ago, and we haven&#x2019;t had a bite to eat since then.&#x201d;</p><p>Farmer Sally wondered why such wealthy people hadn&#x2019;t simply bought food from fellow travelers on the road, but she was too polite to ask. Instead, she ordered some village boys to run and fetch bowls of swampweed soup and millet bread and what little goat-rump was left over from the festival&#x2014;but when it was laid before the visitors, they turned the food away.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude,&#x201d; said the man, &#x201c;but we can&#x2019;t eat this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a humble spread,&#x201d; said Farmer Sally, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;re probably used to feasts fit for kings, but it&#x2019;s all we have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t that,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Grains, vegetables, animal meat&#x2014;our bodies simply can&#x2019;t process them. And if we force ourselves to eat, it will only make us weaker.&#x201d;</p><p>The villagers were confused. &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t eat grains, vegetables, or animals,&#x201d; asked Farmer Pullman, &#x201c;then what can you eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People,&#x201d; the man replied.</p><p>Everyone in the small house took a step back from the visitors.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean to tell us you&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannibals?&#x201d; said Farmer Hayworth.</p><p>&#x201c;By nature, not by choice,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;But, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>He went on to reassure the shocked villagers that they were civilized cannibals and never killed innocent people. They, and others like them, had worked out an arrangement with the king by which they agreed never to kidnap and eat people against their will, and in turn they were allowed to purchase, at terrific expense, the severed limbs of accident victims and the bodies of hanged criminals. This comprised the entirety of their diet. They were now on their way to the coast of Meek because it was the place in Britain which boasted both the highest rate of accidents and the most deaths by hanging, and so food was relatively abundant&#x2014;if not exactly plentiful.</p><p>Even though cannibals in those days were wealthy, they nearly always went hungry; firmly law-abiding, they were doomed to live lives of perpetual undernourishment, forever tormented by an appetite they could rarely satisfy. And it seemed that the cannibals who had arrived in Swampmuck, already starving and many days from Meek, were now doomed to die.</p><p>Having learned all this, the people of any other village, peculiar or otherwise, probably would have shrugged their shoulders and let the cannibals starve. But the Swampmuckians were compassionate almost to a fault, and so no one was surprised when Farmer Hayworth took a step forward, hobbling on crutches, and said, &#x201c;It just so happens that I lost my leg in an accident a few days ago. I tossed it into the swamp, but I&#x2019;m sure I could find it again, if the eels haven&#x2019;t eaten it yet.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Practicing Poet: Writing Beyond the Basics</h2><p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The Practicing Poet: Writing Beyond the Basics</i></b><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Named a Best Book for Writers by Poets &amp; Writers</b>&nbsp; <br>Organized into ten sections with each devoted to a poetic concept, <i>The Practicing Poet&nbsp;</i>begins with "Discovering New Material," "Finding the Best Words," "Making Music," "Working with Sentences and Line Breaks," "Crafting Surprise," and "Achieving Tone."

So Logan Cates naturally headed for Papago Wells. But he wasn&#x2019;t the only one. Fleeing the fierce Churupati and his Apache warriors, other travelers had come there too. And when the Apaches found them, they began a siege as relentless and unforgiving as the barren land...and just as inescapable.<br><br> The last thing Cates wanted was to be responsible for the lives of thirteen desperate strangers and a shipment of gold. But he knew that if they were to survive, he was their last chance. He also knew that some in the party were willing to die&#x2014;or kill&#x2014;to get their hands on the money. If he couldn&#x2019;t get them to work together, it wouldn&#x2019;t be the desert or even the Apaches that would do them in&#x2014;it would be the greed of the very people he was trying to save.</p><p>Logan Cates knew the many ways the Arizona desert could kill a man. He had ridden the sunblasted dunes, tracked the Apache over barren lava beds, sheltered in the dry washes of this forbidding land. Above all, he knew a man needed water to survive. Cates rode to Papago Wells a few miles ahead of an Apache war party led by the vicious Churupati. There he met a dozen desert wanderers whom chance had led to the only water between Yuma and hell. There they came under siege by the Indians. And there they would make their stand--with little hope of living beyond the next day and only a hard man named Logan Cates to show them how to conquer their true enemy: fear.Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier.

The translation work was done from a 1550 Latin original of the Confession. The Magdeburg Confession is the first known document in the history of man to formally set forth the Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates. The Lesser Magistrate Doctrine teaches that when a superior authority makes unjust laws or decrees, the lesser authority has a God-given right and duty to resist those unjust laws or decrees. In 1548, Charles V imposed his infamous Augsburg Interim which was an attempt to smash the Protestant Reformation. While all of Protestant Germany conformed to his decree, one city decided to take a stand and resist his authority &#x2013; the city of Magdeburg. The pastors of Magdeburg issued their Confession and Defense of the Pastors and Other Ministers of the Church of Magdeburg on April 13, 1550 AD. Five months after issuing their Confession, Charles V&#x2019;s forces marched on Magdeburg. The people of Magdeburg burned everything outside the city walls and closed the city gates. The siege of Magdeburg had begun. What constitutes a tyrannical government? How and when are Christians to respond and act when a government does become tyrannical? Are Christians to give unlimited obedience to the State? These questions and others were addressed and answered by the pastors in the Confession. In defiance of Charles V&#x2019;s tyranny, they declared, &#x201c;Divine laws necessarily trump human ones.&#x201d; What the pastors of Magdeburg wrote in the Confession significantly impacted men like John Knox, Theodore Beza and Phillip Mornay. The repercussions of the Confession were felt throughout Western Civilization all the way to the founding of America as a nation. For over 460 years, the Confession has existed only in Latin and German. Now English-speaking people can read it for themselves. This is the first English translation of The Magdeburg Confession ever written.

Select is the key word here, as the discoveries and inventions flanking the time line ribbon that runs across the middle of each page never result in a crowded look.

After bringing many men, women, and children to the new land, White went back to England to gather supplies for the long winter. But when he finally returned to the fort almost three years later, he found that all of the colonists had vanished. The only signs of life left were the letters <b>CRO</b> carved into a tree and the word <b>CROATOAN</b> carved into one of the fort's posts. Some people think that the Spanish army captured the colonists; some people think that the local native people murdered them; others think that the colonists went off to live with the native people and start a new life. Still others think that the colonists tried to sail home to England and were lost at sea. No one knows for sure. <br> Become a detective as you read this true story, study the clues, and try to figure out the fate of the lost colony of Roanoke. The Unsolved Mystery from History series is written by acclaimed author Jane Yolen and former private investigator Heidi Elisabet Yolen Stemple. Read carefully and check your clues. You might be the first to solve a puzzle that has baffled people for years.</p><p>Heidi Elizabet Yolen Stemple is Jane Yolen&#x2019;s daughter and sometime writing partner.

She lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. Visit her at JaneYolen.com.Gr. 2-5. As in <i>The Mary Celeste</i> (1999) and<i> The Wolf Girls</i> (2001), this picture book for older children is framed by a fictional story about a detective's daughter who investigates a famous historical mystery. Here she tells readers about the founding of the Roanoke colony in 1587. It seems the colony's leader, who departed to obtain supplies, returned to find the colonists gone. The girl sets forth several theories and questions about what may have happened to the "lost colony," letting readers examine the facts and draw their own conclusions. There's a lot going on here: a framework story, the historical account, the ending hypotheses, and the addition of "notebook pages" with background information; children may need to read the book more than once to take it all in. The large, picture-book format offers plenty of scope for Roth's appealing narrative illustrations in watercolor and pencil. An attractive, intriguing introduction to the lost colony. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The devastation that ensued finally grew impossible to ignore in 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Mar�a, as the physical destruction compounded the infrastructure collapse and trauma inflicted by the debt crisis. In <i>Fantasy Island</i>, Ed Morales traces how, over the years, Puerto Rico has served as a colonial satellite, a Cold War Caribbean showcase, a dumping ground for US manufactured goods, and a corporate tax shelter. He also shows how it has become a blank canvas for mercenary experiments in disaster capitalism on the frontlines of climate change, hamstrung by internal political corruption and the US federal government's prioritization of outside financial interests.<br><br>Taking readers from San Juan to New York City and back to his family's home in the Luquillo Mountains, Morales shows us the machinations of financial and political interests in both the US and Puerto Rico, and the resistance efforts of Puerto Rican artists and activists. Through it all, he emphasizes that the only way to stop Puerto Rico from being bled is to let Puerto Ricans take control of their own destiny, going beyond the statehood-commonwealth-independence debate to complete decolonization.<br></p><p><b>Ed Morales</b> is the author of <i>Latinx</i>, <i>The Latin Beat</i>, and <i>Living in Spanglish</i>.

In this brief and inspiring book, based on Engle's study of <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, she explains how to use the prayer and experience immediate benefits:<br></p><ul><li>being less irritable, more patient</li><li>laughing more</li><li>feeling like you have more time, more energy</li><li>worrying less</li><li>making decisions more easily</li><li>saying no without guilt</li></ul><p></p><p>A typical prayer goes something like this: <i>"Please help us find the money to pay our mortgage this month."</i> Saying the prayer may help you feel like the burden of that month's mortgage has been lifted, but the part of you that feeds on fear will simply seek out new financial worries to keep you awake at night. Old patterns remain intact.</p><p>In contrast, asking,<i> "Please heal my fear-based thoughts about our mortgage"</i> lifts the burden AND relieves the need to re-create that fear and hold onto it. This prayer heals your very desire for burdens, your addiction to fear-based thoughts, freeing you to live without that fear and with greater peace of mind. As a result, your financial situation is also free to improve. That's what makes it so different.</p><p>One Facebook fan told Engle, <i>"The most blessed aspect of this prayer is all the open space it creates for peace--I never knew how many fear-based thoughts were clogging up in me until... this prayer."</i></p></p><p><b>Debra Landwehr Engle</b> is the originator and facilitator of Tending Your Inner Garden workshops and a longtime teacher of A Course in Miracles, as well as a widely traveled inspirational speaker.

And what if this cost you nothing, took little of your time, and had absolutely no risk of backfiring or hurting anybody else? You are about to find such a gift in this book, and you will soon discover that all of your fears grew out of nothing. In so doing you are also about to embark on a life where forgiveness becomes a tangible practice, and being fixated on fear becomes a thing of the past." --<b>Dr. Lee Jampolsky</b>, author of <i>Smile for No Good Reason</i> and <i>How to Say Yes When Your Body Says No</i><br><br>"Debra Engle's <i>The Only Little Prayer You Need</i>, took my breath away as I sat reading it. Like Engle, I, too, have been a student of "A Course in Miracles" for thirty years. And also like her, it has taught me all the important spiritual tools I rely on every day. However, her little prayer provides a much-needed shortcut to peace filled living that everyone, course student or not, can use daily. Hourly, even minute by minute. Thank you, Debra. I needed to read your book today. I needed to shift my perception on a current situation and your book and prayer did just that for me." --<b>Karen Casey, Ph.D.</b>, author of <i>Each Day a New Beginning</i><br><br>"We are made to live lives of tolerance, respect and compassion.

Debra Engle, in this precious book, provides the compass to learn how to be and to live together, in order to contribute to the transition from a culture of imposition and violence to a culture of conciliation and peace, from force to words." -<b>Federico Mayor Zaragoza</b>, Former Director General of UNESCO and President of the Foundation for a Culture of Peace<br><br>"A delightful little book on healing our fear-based thoughts through prayer, which is a giving up of oneself in order to be at one with Love." -<b>Jon Mundy, Ph.D.</b>, author of <i>Living A Course in Miracles</i> and publisher of <i>Miracles</i> magazine<br><br>"Inspired by the psycho-spiritual wisdom of <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, this concise little tome offers peace of mind, laughter, more energy, and freedom from guilt. It's a lot to promise, but Engle delivers the means to the end she commits to in the title. In doing so, she's redefined the word "prayer", removing the overtones of hierarchical religion. Instead she uses the word to express a very simple, six-word request for help. The request is made to our inner selves not to an external overseer. A transcendent force is implied, but without the need to label it. Really, it's neuroscience. Change your thinking, change your life.

Her experiences in that system, coupled with her dissatisfaction with the quality of education that her two youngest children were receiving in prestigious private schools, convinced her that children deserved better than what was passing for acceptable education.

Education is painful and not gained by playing games. Yet it is my privilege to destroy myself if that is what I choose to do. I have the right to fail, but I do not have the right to take other people with me.<br><br>It is my right to care nothing about myself, but I must be willing to accept the consequences for that failure, and I must never think that those who have chosen to work, while I played, rested and slept, will share their bounties with me.<br><br>My success and my education can be companions that no misfortune can depress, no crime can destroy, and no enemy can alienate. Without education, man is a slave, a savage wandering from here to there believing whatever he is told.<br><br>Time and chance come to us all. I can be either hesitant or courageous.

He slammed lower behind the outcropping and felt his face, seeing blood on his assault gloves. His platoon leader, First Lieutenant Blake Alberty, threw himself into the prone and said with black humor, &#x201c;You get our asses out of here, and I&#x2019;ll get you another purple heart.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Blackmar said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got nothing else to work with. The eighty-ones won&#x2019;t reach and the Apaches are dry.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Another stream of incoming machine-gun fire raked their position, and Alberty returned it, saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in trouble. And I&#x2019;m not going to be the next COP Keating.&#x201d;</p><p>Both from the 25th Infantry Division, they were part of a string of Combat Outposts in the Kunar Province of Afghanistan, ostensibly designed to prevent the infiltration of Taliban fighters from the nearby border of Pakistan, but in reality a giant bulls eye for anyone wanting a scalp. They were attacked at the COP on a daily basis, but followed orders, continuing their patrols to the nearby villages in an effort to get the locals on the government side.</p><p>The mountains of the Kunar province were extreme, and afforded the Taliban an edge, putting the Americans on equal terms. Everything was done on foot, as the mountains negated artillery, leaving the troops reliant on helicopter gunship support. The same thing COP Keating had relied on when it was overrun two years before.</p><p>The incoming fire grew in strength, and Alberty began receiving reports of casualties. They were on their own, and about to be overrun. A trophy for the Taliban. Blackmar heard the platoon designated marksmen firing, their rifles&#x2019; individual cracks distinctive among the rattle of automatic fire, and felt impotent.</p><p>As the forward observer, his entire career had been to provide steel on target for the Infantry he supported. He was the man they turned to when they wanted American firepower, and now he had nothing to provide, his radio silent.</p><p>Alberty shouted, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re flanking, they&#x2019;re flanking! We need the gunships.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar was about to reply when his radio squawked. &#x201c;Kilo Seven-Nine, this is Texas Thirteen. You have targets?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Yes, yes. What&#x2019;s your ordinance?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Five hundred pound GBU.&#x201d;</p><p>GBU? A fast mover with JDAMs?</p><p>He said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your heading?&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I&#x2019;m a BUFF. Way above you.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar heard the words, and couldn&#x2019;t believe it. He&#x2019;d called in everything from 81-millimeter mortars to F15 strike aircraft, but he&#x2019;d never called fire from a B-52 stratofortress. Not that it mattered, as the five-hundred pound JDAM was guided by GPS.</p><p>He lased the Taliban position for range, shacked up his coordinates, and sent the fire request. The pilot reported bombs out, asking for a splash. He kept his eyes on the enemy, waiting. Nothing happened.</p><p>Alberty screamed, &#x201c;You hit the village, you hit the village. Shift, shift.&#x201d;</p><p>The village? That damn thing is seven hundred meters away.</p><p>He checked his location and lased again, now plotting the impact danger close as the enemy advanced. He repeated the call with the new coordinates, and waited for the splash.</p><p>Alberty shouted again, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pounding the fucking village! Get the rounds on target, damn it.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar frantically checked his map and his range, shouting back, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right. I&#x2019;m on target. The bombs aren&#x2019;t tracking.&#x201d;</p><p>The volume of enemy fire increased, and Alberty began maneuvering his forces, forgetting about the firepower circling at 30,000 feet. Blackmar called for another salvo, recalculating yet again. No ordinance impacted the enemy. Thirty minutes later, the American&#x2019;s superior firepower meant nothing, as the fight went hand-to-hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Captain &#x201c;Tiny&#x201d; Shackleford noticed the first glitch when the coordinates on his screen showed the RQ-107 unmanned aerial vehicle a hundred miles away from the designated flight path. Which, given his target area over Iran&#x2019;s nuclear facilities, was a significant problem.</p><p>Flying the drone from inside Tonapah airbase, Nevada, he felt a rush of adrenaline as if he were still in the cockpit of an F-16 over enemy airspace and his early warning sensors had triggered a threat. He called an alert, saying he had an issue, then realized he&#x2019;d lost link with the UAV. He began working the problem, trying to prevent the drone from going into autopilot and landing, while the CIA owners went into overdrive.</p><p>The RQ-107 was a new stealth UAV, the latest and greatest evolution of unmanned reconnaissance, and as such, it was used out of Afghanistan to probe the nuclear ambitions of Iran. It had proven the ability to fly above the Persian state with impunity, and was a major link to the intelligence community on Iranian intentions. Losing one inside Iranian airspace would be a disaster. An army of technicians went to work, a modern day version of Apollo Thirteen.</p><p>They failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Oglethorpe, the United States Secretary of Defense, said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had forty-two confirmed GPS failures. We&#x2019;ve identified the glitch, and it&#x2019;s repaired, but we lost a UAV inside Iran because of it.&#x201d; </p><p>Alexander Palmer, the National Security advisor, said, &#x201c;Glitch? I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s more than a glitch. What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The new AEP system of the GPS constellation had a software/hardware mating problem. It&#x2019;s something that the contractor couldn&#x2019;t see beforehand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit. It&#x2019;s something they failed to see. Did it affect the civilian systems? Am I going to hear about this from Transportation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Only the military signal, but you&#x2019;re definitely going to hear about it from the Iranians. They&#x2019;re already claiming they brought our bird down.&#x201d;</p><p>Palmer rubbed his forehead, thinking about what to brief the president. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a damn. They got the drone, and that&#x2019;s going to be a fact on tomorrow&#x2019;s news. Let&#x2019;em crow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want to allow them the propaganda of saying they can capture our most sophisticated UAV? We&#x2019;ll look like idiots.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone is an idiot. But I&#x2019;d rather the world wonder about the Iranian statements.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;As opposed to what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The fucking truth, that&#x2019;s what.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b><br></b><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>Present Day</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joshua Bryant saw the seatbelt light flash and knew they had just broken through ten thousand feet. Time to shut off his iPod, but more importantly, it was his turn in the window seat.</p><p>Only fifteen years old, his passion in life was airplanes and his singular goal was to become a pilot&#x2014;unlike his younger sister, who only wanted the window to aggravate him. She&#x2019;d complained as they had boarded, and his mother had split the difference. She got the window for takeoff, and he got it for landing.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, we&#x2019;re coming into final approach and it&#x2019;s my turn.&#x201d;</p><p>His sister immediately responded, &#x201c;No we&#x2019;re not! He&#x2019;s just talking like he knows what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d; </p><p>Joshua started to reply when the pilot came over the intercom, telling them they had about ten more minutes before parking at their gate in Denver. Joshua smiled instead, just to annoy her. She grouched a little more, but gave up her seat.</p><p>After buckling up, he pressed his face against the glass, looking towards the wing jutting out three rows up, watching the flaps getting manipulated by the pilot. The aircraft continued its approach and he saw the distinctive swastika shape of Denver International Airport.</p><p>A flight attendant came by checking seat belts at a leisurely pace, then another rushed up and whispered in her ear. They both speed-walked in the direction of the cockpit, the original flight attendant&#x2019;s face pale.</p><p>Joshua didn&#x2019;t give it much thought, returning his attention to the window. He placed his hands on either side of his face to block the glare, and began scanning. On the ground below he saw a small private plane taxiing. With as much conscious thought as someone recognizing a vegetable, he knew it was a Cessna 182.</p><p>The Boeing 757 continued to descend and began to overtake the Cessna. Strangely, the Cessna continued taxiing. With a start, Joshua realized it had taken off, directly underneath them. He watched it rise in slow motion, closing the distance to their fragile airship.</p><p>He turned from the window and screamed, &#x201c;Plane! An airplane!&#x201d; His mother said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>The Cessna collided with the left wing just outside the engine, a jarring bump as if the 757 had hit a pocket of turbulent air. Passengers began to murmur and whip their heads left and right, looking for someone to explain what had happened.</p><p>Twenty feet of wing sheared off as the Cessna chewed through the metal like a buzzsaw, exploding in a spectacular spray of metal confetti, followed by a fuel-air ball of fire.</p><p>Joshua knew the wing would no longer provide lift. Knew they were all dead. </p><p>He was the first to scream.</p><p>The aircraft yawed to the left, seeming to hang in the air for the briefest of moments, then began to plummet to earth sideways. The rest of the passengers joined Joshua, screaming maniacally, as if that would have any effect on the outcome.</p><p>The fuselage picked up speed and began to spin, the centrifugal force slapping the passengers about, one minute right side up, the next upside down, filling the cabin with flying debris.</p><p>Four seconds later, the screams of all one hundred and eighty seven souls ceased at the exact same moment.</p></p><h2>Ayoade on Ayoade: A Cinematic Odyssey</h2><p>In this book Richard Ayoade -- actor, writer, director, and amateur dentist -- reflects on his cinematic legacy as only he can: in conversation with himself.

Dandridge M. (Mike) Malone, US Army (Ret.), </b>began his army career as a private and ended as a colonel almost 30 years later. During that time, he earned a BS degree from Vanderbilt University and an MS from Purdue, and graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College and the Army War College. Renowned as the army&#x2019;s leading expert on leadership, both in garrison and in combat, he has taught the subject to noncommissioned officers, West Point cadets, and students at various army service schools to include the Army War College. An audiotape he prepared on leadership,&nbsp;<i>Soldier</i>, has some 50,000 copies in circulation among army troop units worldwide. He died in 1995.1<br> &nbsp;<br> The Purpose of Small-Unit Leadership<br> &nbsp;<br> On the battlefield. That&#x2019;s where it is that you&#x2014;Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant&#x2014;will do what it is our Army meant for you to do when you were offered the chance to become a small-unit leader.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mission of the Armed Services is to defend this nation. Our Army&#x2019;s part of that mission is to fight the land battle. Your part of the Army&#x2019;s mission is to lead soldiers and small units during that battle. As a troop leader, that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re for and why you are. Your ultimate purpose is to lead. Troopers. On the battlefield.<br> &nbsp;<br> As you study this leadership book, you will see many examples from the combat arms. But this book is not just for the combat arms. It is designed for use by all small-unit leaders in all kinds of units. &#x201c;How to lead&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t change that much from one kind of unit to another. The missions may vary and the situations may vary, but the central responsibilities of leaders in a rifle company are not all that different from the leadership responsibilities of the leaders in, say, an MP company. If and when war comes, our whole Army will be &#x201c;on the battlefield.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As you&#x2019;ll see in a moment, this book will describe vividly the demands of the battlefield. But most of this book will describe how to prepare for that battlefield&#x2014;how to prepare yourself, your soldiers, and your unit before the battle begins. The reason for this emphasis is pretty simple. Performance during battle is like the tip of an iceberg. It requires a whole lot of support&#x2014;under the surface, behind the scenes&#x2014;before the first round is fired. And the outcome of any battle is determined, with few exceptions, by how well soldiers and units and their leaders were prepared. Individual heroic actions can sometimes turn the tide of battle, but the real key to success on the battlefield, in any army, at any time, has always been well-trained soldiers in well-trained units. The message here should be clear. As a small-unit leader, you should only be doing one of two things:<br> &nbsp;<br> � LEADING SOLDIERS AND SMALL UNITS DURING BATTLE<br> &nbsp;<br> � PREPARING SOLDIERS AND SMALL UNITS TO FIGHT THE BATTLE<br> &nbsp;<br> This book was written for company-level leaders, for those who wear the green tabs. For you, Captain, and for you, Lieutenant, and for you, Sergeant. It is a guide, a &#x201c;road map,&#x201d; to help you build small units that can destroy and defeat small enemy units. The challenge is immediate. We don&#x2019;t know where or when that next battle will be fought. But we know, from history, that the battle will come. And it could come anytime, at a number of different locations. Building battle-ready units must be your number one priority, starting now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Task, Conditions, and Standards for Leadership<br> &nbsp;<br> The objective of this first chapter is to give you the &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; of small-unit leadership. Once you get a handle on that, the later chapters will begin to lay out specific leadership techniques and tools and &#x201c;tricks of the trade.&#x201d; With some idea of the big picture, you can then see how all these techniques and tools &#x201c;fit together&#x201d; to give you what you need to lead.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is an easy way to understand the big picture: three words. If you&#x2019;ll listen out across this big Army of ours, and if you&#x2019;ll listen at small-unit level, you&#x2019;ll hear leaders using three words that were seldom heard just a few years ago: TASK, CONDITIONS, and STANDARDS.<br> &nbsp;<br> These are not just &#x201c;training&#x201d; words. They are also leadership words. Put together the right way, they describe very clearly what&#x2019;s expected of you as a leader.<br> &nbsp;<br> TASK<br> &nbsp;<br> The whole purpose of leadership is simply to accomplish a task. That may sound too simple, but that&#x2019;s what a leader is expected to do. He gets a TASK in the form of a mission or order, and then he gets that task done through the efforts of his followers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Political leaders, community leaders, and even scout leaders are all like you, to some extent. All of you try to put people and things and time and effort together to accomplish a task. The big difference is that you are an Army leader. What that means is that, in the final analysis, you must be ready someday, somewhere, to lead soldiers to accomplish an ultimate task that no one else wants to do, under conditions that no one else wants to tolerate. Small-unit leaders of the combat arms will usually lead this ultimate task&#x2014;but any of us might someday get the call, no matter what our rank or branch or MOS.<br> &nbsp;<br> This ultimate task is what makes you as an Army leader so different from all those other leaders. It&#x2019;s also the essence of being a &#x201c;soldier.&#x201d; It underlies the meaning of &#x201c;service&#x201d; as well, and it is the underpinning of the whole idea of military &#x201c;duty.&#x201d; All these things mean being ready to give up freedom, and even life, for the sake of our nation and its people, in what has been called &#x201c;the noblest act of mankind.&#x201d; At bedrock level, that&#x2019;s what Army leadership is all about. And that&#x2019;s why Army leadership is so important. An awesome responsibility.<br> &nbsp;<br> To accomplish a task&#x2014;that&#x2019;s your purpose. You have done or will do this a thousand times, in response to orders direct, or implied, or trained into you. Orders that come down to you through the one thing that links all our leaders together&#x2014;the chain of command. The chain of command controls, coordinates, and supports. It also challenges. Think about that time when &#x201c;leadership&#x201d; and &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; and &#x201c;service&#x201d; and &#x201c;duty&#x201d; will all come together, when the chain of command will give you that ultimate task to accomplish, when it will say to you, &#x201c;Attack!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The artillery shifts, and small-arms crack, and men tremble, and the platoon tenses for the final assault up the hill. You give the signal&nbsp;...&nbsp;and they go. Why is it that John T. McFerren, soldier, U.S. Army, obeys your order? Leadership, or followership? Neither. It&#x2019;s both. Listen.<br> &nbsp;<br> John T. McFerren assaults up into this kill-or-die situation because<br> &nbsp;<br> a. HIS BUDDIES ARE COUNTING ON HIM TO DO HIS JOB.<br> b. HE THINKS HIS BUDDIES WILL CALL HIM A COWARD IF HE DOESN&#x2019;T ATTACK.<br> c. HE HAS LEARNED THAT HIS LEADER KNOWS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.<br> d. HE WANTS TO PLEASE HIS LEADER.<br> e. HE BELIEVES HE WILL BE COURT-MARTIALED IF HE DOESN&#x2019;T ATTACK.<br> f. HE THINKS HE WILL BE LEFT ALONE IF HE DOESN&#x2019;T ATTACK.<br> g. HE BELIEVES THAT FOLLOWING ORDERS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.<br> h. HE BELIEVES HE WILL BE REWARDED FOR ATTACKING.<br> i. HE BELIEVES THAT ATTACKING IS LESS DANGEROUS THAN NOT ATTACKING.<br> j. HE BELIEVES HE WILL FEEL GUILTY IF HE DOESN&#x2019;T ATTACK.<br> k. HE WANTS TO PROVE HIS MANHOOD, HIS COURAGE, HIS COMPETENCE, OR HIS WORTH AS A SOLDIER.<br> l. HE HATES THE ENEMY.<br> m. HE ENJOYS THE EXCITEMENT AND THRILL OF COMBAT.<br> n. FOLLOWING ORDERS HAS BECOME AUTOMATIC, A HABIT.<br> &nbsp;<br> McFerren assaults for any, or all, or some combination of the above reasons, or for some other reasons not listed. If you had the expertise and the right psychological model, you might somehow figure out the &#x201c;why&#x201d; for McFerren, but next to him there&#x2019;s Johnson and Allen and Brown. They go too, and each for some different pattern of reasons which neither you nor they will ever know&#x2014;but they go. They go because at that critical moment in time, when each will wrestle briefly with the decision of whether to attack or hide, attacking is their best choice. You, as the leader, first out, first up, and out front show them that this is so. And so they go. They follow you. You lead. And that&#x2019;s your TASK.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Underground Railroad Records: Narrating the Hardships, Hairbreadth Escapes, and Death Struggles of Slaves in Their Efforts for Freedom</h2><p><b>A riveting collection of the hardships, hairbreadth escapes, and mortal struggles of enslaved people seeking freedom: These are the true stories of the Underground Railroad.</b><br><br><b>Featuring a powerful introduction by Ta-Nehisi Coates</b> <br><br>As a conductor for the Underground Railroad&#x2014;the covert resistance network created to aid and protect slaves seeking freedom&#x2014;William Still helped as many as eight hundred people escape enslavement. He also meticulously collected the letters, biographical sketches, arrival memos, and ransom notes of the escapees. <i>The Underground Railroad Records</i> is an archive of primary documents that trace the narrative arc of the greatest, most successful campaign of civil disobedience in American history.<br><br> This edition highlights the remarkable creativity, resilience, and determination demonstrated by those trying to subvert bondage. It is a timeless testament to the power we all have to challenge systems that oppress us.</p><p><b>William Still</b> (1821-1902), was an African American abolitionist, writer, historian, and the conductor of the Underground Railroad. Before the American Civil War, Still was a chairman of the Vigilance committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, and directly aided fugitive slaves, keeping records to help families reunite. Born in a free state, Still's father bought his own freedom and his mother was a twice-escaped slave and under federal slave law Still was legally a slave himself. William Still helped as many as 800 slaves escape to freedom.SETH CONCKLIN<br><br>In the long list of names who have suffered and died in the cause of freedom, not one, perhaps, could be found whose efforts to redeem a poor family of slaves were more Christlike than Seth Concklin&#x2019;s, whose noble and daring spirit has been so long completely shrouded in mystery. Except John Brown, it is a question, whether his rival could be found with respect to boldness, disinterestedness and willingness to be sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed.<br><br>By chance one day he came across a copy of the Pennsylvania Freeman, containing the story of Peter Still, &#x201c;the Kidnapped and the Ransomed,&#x201d;&#x2014;�how he had been torn away from his mother, when a little boy six years old; how, for forty years and more, he had been compelled to serve under the yoke, totally destitute as to any knowledge of his parents&#x2019; whereabouts; how the intense love of liberty and desire to get back to his mother had unceasingly absorbed his mind through all these years of bondage; how, amid the most appalling discouragements, prompted alone by his undying determination to be free and be reunited with those from whom he had been sold away, he contrived to buy himself; how, by extreme economy, from doing over-�work, he saved up five hundred dollars, the amount of money required for his ransom, which, with his freedom, he, from necessity, placed unreservedly in the confidential keeping of a Jew, named Joseph Friedman, whom he had known for a long time and could venture to trust,&#x2014;�how he had further toiled to save up money to defray his expenses on an expedition in search of his mother and kindred; how, when this end was accomplished, with an earnest purpose he took his carpet-�bag in his hand, and his heart throbbing for his old home and people, he turned his mind very privately towards Philadelphia, where he hoped, by having notices read in the colored churches to the effect that &#x201c;forty-�one or forty-�two years before two little boys were kidnapped and carried South&#x201d;&#x2014;�that the memory of some of the older members might recall the circumstances, and in this way he would be aided in his ardent efforts to become restored to them.<br><br>And, furthermore, Seth Concklin had read how, on arriving in Philadelphia, after traveling sixteen hundred miles, that almost the first man whom Peter Still sought advice from was his own unknown brother (whom he had never seen or heard of), who made the discovery that he was the long-�lost boy, whose history and fate had been enveloped in sadness so long, and for whom his mother had shed so many tears and offered so many prayers, during the long years of their separation; and, finally, how this self-�ransomed and restored captive, notwithstanding his great success, was destined to suffer the keenest pangs of sorrow for his wife and children, whom he had left in Alabama bondage.<br><br>Seth Concklin was naturally too singularly sympathetic and humane not to feel now for Peter, and especially for his wife and children left in bonds as bound with them. Hence, as Seth was a man who seemed wholly insensible to fear, and to know no other law of humanity and right, than whenever the claims of the suffering and the wronged appealed to him, to respond unreservedly, whether those thus injured were amongst his nearest kin or the greatest strangers,&#x2014;�it mattered not to what race or clime they might belong,&#x2014;�he, in the spirit of the good Samaritan, owning all such as his neighbors, volunteered his services, without pay or reward, to go and rescue the wife and three children of Peter Still.<br><br>The magnitude of this offer can hardly be appreciated. It was literally laying his life on the altar of freedom for the despised and oppressed whom he had never seen, whose kins-�folk even he was not acquainted with. At this juncture even Peter was not prepared to accept this proposal. He wanted to secure the freedom of his wife and children as earnestly as he had ever desired to see his mother, yet he could not, at first, hearken to the idea of having them rescued in the way suggested by Concklin, fearing a failure.<br><br>To J.M. McKim and the writer, the bold scheme for the deliverance of Peter&#x2019;s family was alone confided. It was never submitted to the Vigilance Committee, for the reason, that it was not considered a matter belonging thereto. On first reflection, the very idea of such an undertaking seemed perfectly appalling. Frankly was he told of the great dangers and difficulties to be encountered through hundreds of miles of slave territory. Seth was told of those who, in attempting to aid slaves to escape had fallen victims to the relentless Slave Power, and had either lost their lives, or been incarcerated for long years in penitentiaries, where no friendly aid could be afforded them; in short, he was plainly told, that without a very great chance, the undertaking would cost him his life. The occasion of this interview and conversation, the seriousness of Concklin and the utter failure in presenting the various obstacles to his plan, to create the slightest apparent misgiving in his mind, or to produce the slightest sense of fear or hesitancy, can never be effaced from the memory of the writer. The plan was, however, allowed to rest for a time.<br><br>In the meanwhile, Peter&#x2019;s mind was continually vacillating between Alabama, with his wife and children, and his new-�found relatives in the North. Said a brother, &#x201c;If you cannot get your family, what will you do? Will you come North and live with your relatives?&#x201d; &#x201c;I would as soon go out of the world, as not to go back and do all I can for them,&#x201d; was the prompt reply of Peter.<br><br>The problem of buying them was seriously considered, but here obstacles quite formidable lay in the way. Alabama laws utterly denied the right of a slave to buy himself, much less his wife and children. The right of slave masters to free their slaves, either by sale or emancipation, was positively prohibited by law. With these reflections weighing upon his mind, having stayed away from his wife as long as he could content himself to do, he took his carpet-�bag in his hand, and turned his face toward Alabama, to embrace his family in the prison-�house of bondage.<br><br>His approach home could only be made stealthily, not daring to breathe to a living soul, save his own family, his nominal Jew master, and one other friend&#x2014;�a slave&#x2014;�where he had been, the prize he had found, or anything in relation to his travels. To his wife and children his return was unspeakably joyous. The situation of his family concerned him with tenfold more weight than ever before.<br><br>As the time drew near to make the offer to his wife&#x2019;s master to purchase her with his children, his heart failed him through fear of awakening the ire of slaveholders against him, as he knew that the law and public sentiment were alike deadly opposed to the spirit of freedom in the slave. Indeed, as innocent as a step in this direction might appear, in those days a man would have stood about as good a chance for his life in entering a lair of hungry hyenas, as a slave or free colored man would, in talking about freedom.<br><br>He concluded, therefore, to say nothing about buying. The plan proposed by Seth Concklin was told to Vina, his wife; also what he had heard from his brother about the Underground Rail Road,&#x2014;�how, that many who could not get their freedom in any other way, by being aided a little, were daily escaping to Canada. Although the wife and children had never tasted the pleasures of freedom for a single hour in their lives, they hated slavery heartily, and being about to be far separated from husband and father, they were ready to assent to any proposition that looked like deliverance.<br><br>So Peter proposed to Vina, that she should give him certain small articles, consisting of a cape, etc., which he would carry with him as memorials, and, in case Concklin or any one else should ever come for her from him, as an unmistakable sign that all was right, he would send back, by whoever was to befriend them, the cape, so that she and the children might not doubt but have faith in the man, when he gave her the sign, (cape).<br><br>Again Peter returned to Philadelphia, and was now willing to accept the offer of Concklin. Ere long, the opportunity of an interview was had, and Peter gave Seth a very full description of the country and of his family, and made known to him, that he had very carefully gone over with his wife and children the matter of their freedom. This interview interested Concklin most deeply. If his own wife and children had been in bondage, scarcely could he have manifested greater sympathy for them.<br><br>For the hazardous work before him he was at once prepared to make a start. True he had two sisters in Philadelphia for whom he had always cherished the warmest affection, but he conferred not with them on this momentous mission. For full well did he know that it was not in human nature for them to acquiesce in this perilous undertaking, though one of these sisters, Mrs. Supplee, was a most faithful abolitionist.<br><br>Having once laid his hand to the plough he was not the man to look back,&#x2014;�not even to bid his sisters good-�bye, but he actually left them as though he expected to be home to his dinner as usual. What had become of him during those many weeks of his perilous labors in Alabama to rescue this family was to none a greater mystery than to his sisters. On leaving home he simply took two or three small articles in the way of apparel with one hundred dollars to defray his expenses for a time; this sum he considered ample to start with. Of course he had very safely concealed about him Vina&#x2019;s cape and one or two other articles which he was to use for his identification in meeting her and the children on the plantation.<br><br>His first thought was, on reaching his destination, after becoming acquainted with the family, being familiar with Southern manners, to have them all prepared at a given hour for the starting of the steamboat for Cincinnati, and to join him at the wharf, when he would boldly assume the part of a slaveholder, and the family naturally that of slaves, and in this way he hoped to reach Cincinnati direct, before their owner had fairly discovered their escape.</p><h2>Devil&#39;s Food Cake Murder (A Hannah Swensen Mystery)</h2><p><b>The <i>USA Today</i> Bestseller Guaranteed to Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth!</b><br><br>Hannah Swensen has to admit life is pretty sweet.

But <em>To the Actor </em>is a shortened, heavily modified version of the great director/actor/teacher's original manuscript, and <em>On the Technique of Acting </em>is the first and only book ever to incorporate the complete text of that brilliant manuscript. Scholars and teachers of Chekhov's technique have hailed <em>On the Technique of Acting </em>as the clearest, most accurate presentation of the principles he taught Yul Brynner, Gregory Peck, Marilyn Monroe, Anthony Quinn, Beatrice Straight, and Mala Powers, among others.</p><p>This new, definitive edition of Chekhov's masterful work clarifies the principles outlined in <em>To the Actor </em>concerning the pivotal role of the imagination in actors' understanding of themselves and the roles they play. <em>On the Technique of Acting </em>also expands on Chekhov's previously published work with many unique features, including: </p><ul><li>Thirty additional exercises</li><li>A chapter devoted to screen acting</li><li>More thorough explanations of the Psychological Gesture, inner tempo vs. outer tempo, and other key concepts of Chekhov's approach</li></ul><p>For actors, directors, and anyone interested in the theater, <em>On teh Technique of Acting </em>is an essential handbook.</p></p><p>Michael Chekhov, nephew to the Russian playwright and student of Stanislavski, left Russia and his mentor behind to pursue a career as an actor, director, and teacher in Europe and America. While he was an early advocate of Stanislavski, Chekhov differed from the great teacher in important respects, particularly in his insistence on the use of imagination as opposed to memory in creating a role. (In a famous anecdote, Chekhov once performed a "sense memory" exercise in which he broke down over the tragic death of his aunt. When complimented on the truthfulness of his emotion, he admitted that his "aunt" was entirely imaginary.) One of Chekhov's innovations of technique is the "psychological gesture," in which a repeated external action leads to an internal revelation. Due to his insistence on the importance of the physical rather than the simply intellectual, Chekhov's book is as focused on following its series of exercises as it is in study; <i>acting</i>, he would remind us, is always fundamentally a verb. For actors who feel "hemmed in" by an overinsistence on "feeling" a part or in drawing from their own experiences to feed a role, Chekhov's focus on the primal and limitless nature of imagination is tremendously liberating. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p><h2>A Paris Apartment: A Novel</h2><p><p>The <i>New York Times </i>Best Seller!</p><p>Based on the fascinating true story of a treasure-stocked Parisian apartment opened for the first time in seventy years.</p><p>April Vogt, Sotheby's continental furniture specialist, is speechless when a Paris apartment shuttered for seventy years is discovered in the ninth arrondissement. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there's a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April's quest is no longer about the <i>bureaux plats</i> and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It's about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman.</p></p><p>National bestselling author of <i>A Paris Apartment</i>, MICHELLE GABLE graduated from The College of William &amp; Mary. She currently resides in Cardiff by the Sea, California, where she is at work on her second novel.Chapitre I <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>She only wanted to get out of town. <br>When her boss sidled up and said the words &#x201c;apartment,&#x201d; &#x201c;ninth arrondissement,&#x201d; and &#x201c;a ton of nineteenth-century crap,&#x201d; April instantly thought: vacation. There would be work involved, but no matter, she was going to Paris. As every writer, poet, painter, and, yes, furniture assessor knew, it was the perfect place for escape. <br>The Paris team was already there. Olivier was in charge. April pictured him right then winding through the apartment, tablet in hand, scratching out notes with bony, crooked fingers. He&#x2019;d called in reinforcements from New York because they needed another appraiser, specifically a furniture expert, to bolster their shoddy credentials in that area. According to April&#x2019;s boss the seven-room apartment held &#x201c;enough pieces to outfit twelve upmarket bordellos.&#x201d; Peter&#x2019;s expectations were low. April&#x2019;s were high, but for a different reason. In the end they were both wrong. <br> <br>Chapitre II <br>While her husband tightened his bow tie and straightened both sleeves, tucking and pulling to make his appearance ever more immaculate, April packed for her redeye to Charles de Gaulle. She was normally an efficient and well-honed traveler, but the thirty-day trip was screwing with her luggage ratios. April was never gone more than a week but, apparently, sometime in the two hours between &#x201c;ton of crap&#x201d; and before the issuance of a plane ticket, someone must&#x2019;ve tipped Peter off that this was not your average find. Stay as long as you need, he said. We can extend the ticket. <br>April would remind him of this later. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; Troy asked, noticing his wife&#x2019;s pinched forehead. He yanked his shirt straight. <br>&#x201c;Packing. I&#x2019;m not sure I have enough. Thirty days. In Paris. In June. Which means the temperature can shift sixty degrees in any given twenty-four-hour period. As they say, you don&#x2019;t go to Paris for the weather.&#x201d; <br>April looked up, eyes zeroing in on Troy&#x2019;s left cuff link as it caught the light from the overhead chandelier. It was an irrepressible habit, &#x201c;assessing&#x201d; things, and April had to stop her brain from calculating how much that speck of onyx and platinum might go for at auction. It wasn&#x2019;t that she longed for her husband&#x2019;s sudden demise; not as a matter of course, anyway, and never as a means to obtain wealth. Rather, her mental appraisals were a by-product of working for the world&#x2019;s largest auction house. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the glare?&#x201d; Troy asked, chuckling slightly. &#x201c;Wrong links for this get-up?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re great. Perfect.&#x201d; <br>April looked away, relieved she did not specialize in trinkets passed down from grouchy wrinkled coots and therefore lacked the education to size up her husband&#x2019;s accoutrements. She did, however, have a hard-won de facto master&#x2019;s degree when it came to assessing Troy Vogt. That alone told April the cuff links, the ones her husband earmarked for specific work events, were inestimable, at least to him. What it said about who might be in attendance April did not want to consider. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m overwhelmed.&#x201d; April shook her head, staring at her suitcase but not speaking strictly of sweaters and scarves. <br>&#x201c;Pack light,&#x201d; Troy said. &#x201c;You can always buy more once you&#x2019;re there. It is Paris, you know.&#x201d; <br>April smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your answer to everything, isn&#x2019;t it? Buy more.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s a bad thing?&#x201d; Troy said with a wink as he moved toward the full-length mirror, gently patting April&#x2019;s backside as he squeezed past. &#x201c;You are a rare wife indeed.&#x201d; <br>A rare &#x201c;wife.&#x201d; The word startled April but shouldn&#x2019;t have. It had a new meaning now. Wife. <i>Wife</i>. <br>&#x201c;Not that anyone&#x2019;s keeping track,&#x201d; Troy went on, &#x201c;except for all of Wall Street, but my &#x2018;buy more&#x2019; philosophy is why the recession was the best thing to happen to my firm and our investors.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What a charming attitude,&#x201d; April said, trying to joke. There&#x2019;d been painfully little humor in their home of late. The whole thing felt creaky, rusted out. &#x201c;Who doesn&#x2019;t love the perspective of a smug Wall Street guy to really drive the point home?&#x201d; <br>Troy laughed and slipped on his tuxedo jacket. He continued staring into the mirror, chortling to himself, as April sneaked one last pair of ballet flats into her hard-backed suitcase. <br>&#x201c;Well, speaking of smug Wall Street guys,&#x201d; Troy said with manufactured cheer, &#x201c;it seems you lucked out once again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lucked out?&#x201d; April steadied herself against the chest of drawers ( <i>George III, mahogany bow-fronted, circa 1790</i>) as she eyed her suitcase, sizing up its potential weight. &#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; <br>It didn&#x2019;t look that heavy. <br>April inhaled. Forever imagining her shoulders wide and strong like an Olympic swimmer&#x2019;s instead of the slight, refined ones she really possessed, April heaved the bulging suitcase off the bed. It promptly thumped onto the floor, one-half centimeter away from shattering the bones in her left foot. <br>&#x201c;Lucked out in avoiding another packing injury, for one,&#x201d; Troy said. &#x201c;You realize that thing is bigger than you are, right? Sweetheart, you already have the fortuitous plane ticket. You don&#x2019;t need to break your foot to avoid going to one of my miserable work events.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;re not that bad.&#x201d; April wiped her brow, then tilted the suitcase on its side. <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Not that bad&#x2019;? They&#x2019;re awful and you know it. The other wives will be downright envious.&#x201d; <br>The other wives. And what of them, April wondered? What did they think when they pictured Troy? When they pictured her? <br>&#x201c;You are my lucky girl,&#x201d; Troy went on. &#x201c;Paris will save you. It will save you from yet another dreary evening in a roomful of capitalist drones.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, those wretched capitalists.&#x201d; April rolled her eyes and continued in a poorly played British accent. &#x201c;Sooo fortunate to avoid that ilk. Their vulgar obsession with monetary gain! They&#x2019;ve no class <i>a&#x2019;tall</i>.&#x201d; <br>April hoped she&#x2019;d adequately blanketed the sadness with her lame attempts at humor. She did feel fortunate. However, it was not because she got to bypass a swanky work event and t�te-�-t�tes with the brightest (and most insufferable) on Wall Street. <br>No, April could hang with the best of them, despite not knowing what happened in Asian markets that morning. She could even tolerate the scene&#x2019;s newest trophy wife, who would inevitably overindulge in the champagne and spend half the night marveling at April&#x2019;s various graduate degrees, ultimately screeching to those within booze-spilling range, &#x201c;Troy&#x2019;s wife majored in furniture!&#x201d; <br>But April couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time her PhD in Art History was mistaken for showroom salesmanship. Troy almost never asked her along these days. He was forever &#x201c;just popping by&#x201d; events that were &#x201c;no-spouses&#x201d; or otherwise &#x201c;too boring&#x201d; for April to attend. That was the problem. Troy called her lucky, he called her saved, but April couldn&#x2019;t very well feel grateful to avoid a situation she&#x2019;d never been expected to attend. Or worse, one where her company wasn&#x2019;t even desired. <br>Troy stopped bringing her when things between them had been relatively good. Now, who knew? Was she even supposed to go? In the end April did feel &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; and &#x201c;saved&#x201d; because with a ticket to Paris in hand, she didn&#x2019;t have to contemplate that night&#x2019;s noninvitation. She did not have to wonder if it was by design. <br>&#x201c;The accent needs work,&#x201d; Troy said as he moved to her side. <br>&#x201c;For the record&#x201d;&#x2014;April batted away Troy&#x2019;s arm as he tried to help with the luggage&#x2014;&#x201c;I enjoy your events. The people are interesting. The conversation lively.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Liar.&#x201d; <br>He turned back toward the mirror and gave himself a smoldering stare. April never knew if Troy did this because he suspected she was looking or because he thought she wasn&#x2019;t. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so important that you need to ship out tonight anyway?&#x201d; he asked, the forced casualness in his voice indicative of a certain level of suspicion. <br>&#x201c;You know how these things go.&#x201d; April wondered if he&#x2019;d cop to his own wariness. &#x201c;Furniture emergencies. Have to get in there before the competition catches wind of the sale.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not usually gone more than a week, ten days max, and never with so little notice. It&#x2019;s somewhat disconcerting to get an &#x2018;I have to go out of town&#x2019; text and then come home to find one&#x2019;s wife packing for a month.&#x201d; <br>Is it? April wanted to say. Are you really all that bothered? <br>Under normal circumstances she might joke about <i>him</i> being the lucky one now, wife out of town and all that. But the figurative cuts and bruises were too fresh, their long-term prognosis unclear. <br>&#x201c;I was surprised by the urgency, too,&#x201d; April said. And she was surprised, but also grateful. &#x201c;According to the guys in Paris, it&#x2019;s a remarkable find. A woman died in the South of France but had an apartment in Pigalle that&#x2019;s been in the family for over a century. They never owned the apartment, but leased it for a hundred years.&#x201d; <br>As she spoke, her shoulders began to loosen, her jaw started to unclench. This was a place April still knew how to navigate. <br>&#x201c;The woman,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;the deceased, hadn&#x2019;t been inside since 1940. No one has. I keep thinking the information must be wrong. Maybe the actual dates were lost in translation and it&#x2019;s only been shuttered since an ugly divorce sometime in the late nineties.&#x201d; <br>April felt herself cringe at the word &#x201c;divorce&#x201d; but it was too late. The word was already out. And she&#x2019;d been so careful to avoid it. <br>&#x201c;Seventy years!&#x201d; she chirped, her voice climbing toward the thirteen-foot ceilings. &#x201c;Unimaginable!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Troy said and shrugged, betraying nothing with his stern, stone face. &#x201c;Same thing probably happens in Manhattan all the time. Places stay locked up while estate lawyers and trusts cut automatic checks each month, no one bothering to question a thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not if it was anything like this apartment. Evidently it&#x2019;s crammed to the ceiling with furniture and paintings and basically every item that came into the family&#x2019;s possession prior to World War II.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anything good?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Olivier seems to believe so, or I wouldn&#x2019;t be going. If nothing else, it&#x2019;s all fresh to market. Not even the Germans got in there.&#x201d; April shook her head in amazement. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think at least one errant, gambling-addicted, drugged-up family member would have wanted to get his hands on the stuff somewhere along the way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Unless it&#x2019;s shit.&#x201d; Troy picked up his phone and tapped out a message. His formerly smooth brow bunched up. &#x201c;A Parisian hoarder,&#x201d; he continued, though he was now most of the way checked out of their conversation. <br>April sighed. <br>&#x201c;Ah, hon, I&#x2019;m just kidding,&#x201d; he said, always quick with the necessary retraction, like a reflex. &#x201c;It sounds very cool. Really.&#x201d; <br>The sigh? She hadn&#x2019;t meant it like that. <br>&#x201c;Yes. Cool.&#x201d; April waved her hand around as if clearing the air. The gesture was haphazard but enough to pull Troy temporarily from his phone. <br>&#x201c;Your rings,&#x201d; he said, staring at her hand and frowning slightly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in the safe?&#x201d; <br>April nodded and looked down at her bare finger. No one wore their good jewelry in Europe, right? This wasn&#x2019;t about their marriage, it was about her job. Biting her lip, April blinked away the sudden sting in her eyes. <br>&#x201c;Troy, listen&#x2014;&#x201d; April started, but he was already back to punching at his phone. <br>Suddenly April&#x2019;s own phone rang. The car was downstairs. She looked over at her handsome husband and around at their handsome home and thought how happy she had been. For a time her life was bright and shining. <i>Her</i> apartment held everything she always wanted. Seventy years? She&#x2019;d hoped to stay longer. Forever. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you,&#x201d; Troy said, appearing at April&#x2019;s side as she tucked her phone into the leather tote she&#x2019;d packed for the plane. <br>As he wrapped her in a hug, his perfectly masculine Troy scent filling every pocket of air around them, April tried to take him in. She tried not to contemplate when or if she&#x2019;d have this five-senses feel of him again. <br>Troy gently kissed the top of her head. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to leave,&#x201d; he said, sighing loudly. &#x201c;Maybe you can wait. A few days?&#x201d; <br>He sounded so sincere. <br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; April said and pulled away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back soon.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Michelle Gable <br></p><h2>The Elfstones of Shannara (Shannara, No. 2)</h2><p><b>ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FANTASY TALES OF ALL TIME.

A very famous book and one of only six saint&#39;s autobiographies in existence.</p><p>St. Margaret Mary Alacoque was born Marguerite Marie Alacoque at Lhautecour, France, in 1647. Even as a young child, she preferred prayer and silence to ordinary recreation, possessing a great love for the holy Sacrament of the Eucharist. A mystic, she also experienced visions of our Lord while still young, and took her religious habit in 1671. Subsequently, she began receiving revelations of our Lord&#39;s Sacred Heart, and published an autobiography out of obedience to her superiors. St. Margaret Mary died in 1690 and was canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920.</p><h2>The Way of a Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues His Way (Shambhala Classics)</h2><p>This classic of world spiritual literature is the firsthand account of a pilgrim's journey as he endeavors to live out Saint Paul's instruction to "pray without ceasing." The narrator, an unnamed nineteenth-century peasant, sets out on his pilgrimage with nothing but a Bible, a rosary, and some dried bread. As he walks, he recites the Jesus prayer ("Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me")&#x2014;a prayer that is said to quiet anxiety and fill the heart with love for all creation. With this prayer constantly on his lips, the pilgrim undergoes a profound spiritual education. This edition includes the sequel to <i>The Way of a Pilgrim, </i> entitled <i>A Pilgrim Continues His Way, </i> which contains a lengthy appendix reviewing the teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Jesus prayer.</p><p><i>The Way of a Pilgrim</i> is a spiritual classic, but its origins are shrouded in mystery. It came to a remote monastery in Greece in the 19th century and was first published in 1884. Whether it is literal, fictitious, metaphorical, or pedagogical is unknown. The story follows an itinerant spiritual wanderer, all the time practicing Saint Paul's exhortation to "pray without ceasing." Specifically, the pilgrim repeats one prayer unceasingly, the Jesus prayer, until it becomes a sort of mantra. Through repetition of the prayer and encounters with his fellow inhabitants of 19th-century Russia and Siberia, the wanderer finds a spiritual enlightenment.<p> <i>The Way of a Pilgrim</i> is an oddity, but it can also be strikingly profound. In its sequel, <i>A Pilgrim Continues His Way</i>, the pilgrim engages an even richer dramatis personae in dialogues and spiritual lessons. Olga Savin's crisp, straightforward translation preserves the distinctive timelessness that makes the book great spiritual literature. This edition also includes three appendices that elaborate on the narrative's themes and a helpful glossary. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Olga Savin is a graduate of St. Vladimir&#39;s Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York.</p><h2>Where the Heart Is</h2><p>Talk about unlucky sevens. An hour ago, seventeen-year-old, seven months pregnant Novalee Nation was heading for California with her boyfriend. Now she finds herself stranded at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma, with just $7.77 in change. But Novalee is about to discover hidden treasures in this small Southwest town--a group of down-to-earth, deeply caring people willing to help a homeless, jobless girl living secretly in a Wal-Mart. From Bible-thumping blue-haired Sister Thelma Husband to eccentric librarian Forney Hull who loves Novalee more than she loves herself, they are about to take her--and you, too--on a moving, funny, and unforgettable journey to . . . Where the Heart Is.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, December 1998</b>: A funny thing happens to Novalee Nation on her way to Bakersfield, California. Her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willie Jack Pickens, abandons her in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart and takes off on his own, leaving her with just 10 dollars and the clothes on her back. Not that hard luck is anything new to Novalee, who is "seventeen, seven months pregnant, thirty-seven pounds overweight--and superstitious about sevens.... For most people, sevens were lucky. But not for her," Billie Letts writes. "She'd had a bad history with them, starting with her seventh birthday, the day Momma Nell ran away with a baseball umpire named Fred..."<p> Still, finding herself alone and penniless in Sequoyah, Oklahoma is enough to make even someone as inured to ill fortune as Novalee want to give up and die. Fortunately, the Wal-Mart parking lot is the Sequoyah equivalent of a town square, and within hours Novalee has met three people who will change her life: Sister Thelma Husband, a kindly eccentric; Benny Goodluck, a young Native American boy; and Moses Whitecotton, an elderly African American photographer. For the next two months, Novalee surreptitiously makes her home in the Wal-Mart, sleeping there at night, exploring the town by day. When she goes into labor and delivers her baby there, however, Novalee learns that sometimes it's not so bad to depend on the kindness of strangers--especially if one of them happens to be Sam Walton, the superchain's founder.</p><p> <i>Where the Heart Is</i> oddly mixes heart-warming vignettes and surprising, brutal violence. Novalee's story is juxtaposed with occasional chapters chronicling Willy Jack's downward spiral into prison, disappointment, and degradation. And even in Sequoyah, sudden storms, domestic violence, kidnapping, and deadly fires punctuate Novalee's progress from homeless, unwed teen mom to successful, happy member of the community. This is not a subtle book; there's never any doubt that our heroine will make a home for herself and her baby or that Willy Jack will get what he deserves for abandoning them. Still, Billie Letts has created several memorable characters, and there's always room for another novel that celebrates the life-affirming qualities of reading, the importance of education, and the power of love to change lives. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Billie Letts was the New York Times bestselling and award-winning author of <i>Where the Heart Is, The Honk and Holler Opening Soon, Shoot the Moon</i>, and <i>Made in the U.S.A</i>.

Out of options, she reluctantly accepts her father's offer to help refurbish Birdsong, the old family place he recently inherited in Guthrie, Georgia. All it will take, he tells her, is a little paint and some TLC to turn the fading Victorian mansion into a real-estate cash cow. </p> <p> But, oh, is Dempsey in for a surprise when she arrives in Guthrie. "Bird Droppings" would more aptly describe the moldering Pepto Bismol-pink dump with duct-taped windows and a driveway full of junk. There's also a murderously grumpy old lady, one of Dempsey's distant relations, who has claimed squatter's rights and isn't moving out. Ever. </p> <p> Furthermore, everyone in Guthrie seems to know Dempsey's business, from a smooth-talking real-estate agent to a cute lawyer who owns the local newspaper. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the pesky FBI agents who show up on Dempsey's doorstep, hoping to pry information about her ex-boss from her. </p> <p> All Dempsey can do is roll up her sleeves and get to work. And before long, what started as a job of necessity somehow becomes a labor of love and, ultimately, a journey that takes her to a place she never expected--back home again. </p> <p> <strong>Mary Kay Andrews's Top Fives</strong> </p> <p>We caught up with Mary Kay Andrews, the prolific author of <i>The Fixer Upper</i>, <i>Deep Dish</i> and other bestselling Southern-fried romances, and learned about a few of her favorite things--from books to musicals to interior decorating tips (a passion of hers which plays a prominent role in her new book).</p> <p></p><b>Top Five Books</b> <ol> <li> <i>Rebecca</i> by Daphne du Maurier </li><li> <i>Void Moon</i> by Michael Connelly </li><li> <i>Big Stone Gap</i> by Adriana Trigiani </li><li> <i>Crazy for You</i> by Jennifer Crusie </li><li> <i>Get Shorty</i> by Elmore Leonard </li></ol> <b>Top Five Movies/DVDs</b> <ol> <li> <i>Sabrina</i> (the original with Audrey Hepburn) </li><li> <i>Charade</i> (again, the original with Audrey Hepburn) </li><li> <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> </li><li> <i>Auntie Mame</i> (not the gawdawful musical) </li><li> <i>The Quiet Man</i> </li></ol> <b>Top Five Movie Musicals</b> <ol> <li> <i>Camelot</i> </li><li> <i>Funny Girl</i> </li><li> <i>South Pacific</i> </li><li> <i>My Fair Lady</i> </li><li> <i>West Side Story</i> </li></ol> <b>Top Five Decorating Books</b> <ol> <li> <i>Shabby Chic</i> by Rachel Ashwell </li><li> <i>A House in the South</i> by Frances Schultz and Paula Wallace </li><li> <i>Mary Emmerling's Beach Cottages</i> by Mary Emmerling </li><li> <i>Mary Emmerling's American Country Cottages</i> by Mary Emmerling </li><li> <i>An Affair with a House</i> by Bunny Williams </li></ol> <b>Top Five Renovating Tips</b> <ol> <li> An old house needs old doors, hardware and fixtures. Nothing says &#x201c;new and cheap&#x201d; faster than a flimsy hollow-core door and bright gold repro brass hardware. Look for solid wood doors and wood frame windows at salvage yards and antique markets. And don&#x2019;t forget to check the &#x201c;building materials&#x201d; category on Craigslist. I got all the doors for my beach house off Craigslist--for $5 apiece. Vintage hardware can frequently be found at flea markets, or check online sources like eBay. </li><li> Vintage light fixtures give a great look--but be sure you factor in the cost of re-wiring them, and finding good-looking shades. Nothing gives a lamp that &#x201c;granny&#x201d; look faster than a dingy yellow shade. </li><li> Before you invest in antique cast-iron claw-foot tubs or sinks, make sure they have proper fittings. Measure drains and faucet spreads and make sure you can find new ones that will fit and function properly. Antique toilets are generally a bad idea--most local codes require low-flow toilets for water conservation. </li><li> Before re-wiring a house, put together a furniture floor plan. You don&#x2019;t want a heat register under the living room sofa, but you will want outlets on either side of the bed for reading lamps, and for any area that might be used as an office you&#x2019;ll want plenty of grounded plugs. And how about that flat-screen television your husband wants? Plan now for cable locations. </li><li> Be flexible. A great fireplace surround could become a headboard, as could an old paneled door--turned sideways. And that leaded glass window that had to be removed in the remodel? Why not fit it with mirrors and a hinge and make it into a bathroom medicine cabinet? </li></ol> <b>Top Five Best Junking Finds</b> <ol> <li> Pair of barrel-back armchairs--$30 at an estate sale. They were covered in gold embossed vinyl when I found &#x2018;em. But with the legs stained ebony, and a gorgeous blue Ralph Lauren fabric reupholstery, they&#x2019;re perfect by my fireplace. </li><li> Set of eight antique Wedgewood black and cream transferware plates--$30 at an estate sale. The seller&#x2019;s mother used some of them for cat dishes, others as an ashtray! </li><li> Vintage landscape oil painting, Tuscany maybe? Or Provence? Who cares! Bought at a &#x201c;divorce sale&#x201d;--the ex-husband sold this beautiful painting for $50 because it had belonged to his ex-wife. I spent a small fortune framing it, but it&#x2019;s the basis for a collection of treasured landscape paintings. </li><li> Wicker settee, Salvation Army find for $25. I&#x2019;d walked to the store, and had to hoof it back home in a hurry for money and my car. </li><li> Faux alligator train case--found at a yard sale. When I asked the seller if she&#x2019;d do better on the price, she replied that she&#x2019;d give it to me for free--if I could figure out how to open it. Since it had a combination lock like the one on my high school graduation luggage, I twirled the dial to 0-0-0--because I never figured out how to change mine--and sure enough, the lock popped open. Score! </li></ol><p>After her boss is caught in a political scandal, fledgling Washington lobbyist Dempsey Jo Killebrew is left broke, unemployed, and homeless.

Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos and ending with the massacre of Sioux at Wounded Knee, this extraordinary book tells how the American Indians lost their land, lives and liberty to white settlers pushing westward. Woven into a an engrossing saga of cruelty, treachery and violence are the fascinating stories of such legendary figures as Sitting Bull, Cochise, Crazy Horse and Geronimo. First published in 1970, Dee Brown&#39;s brutal and compelling narrative changed the way people thought about the original inhabitants of America, and focused attention on a national disgrace.</p><p>First published in 1970, this extraordinary book changed the way Americans think about the original inhabitants of their country. Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that "history is written by the victors"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative, Dee Brown focused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted, <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i> has sold 5 million copies around the world. Thirty years after it first broke onto the national conscience, it has lost none of its importance or emotional impact. <i>--John Stevenson</i>12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Watching Baseball Smarter: A Professional Fan&#39;s Guide for Beginners, Semi-experts, and Deeply Serious Geeks</h2><p><p>This smart and funny fan&#x2019;s guide to baseball explains the ins and outs of pitching, hitting, running, and fielding, while offering insider trivia and anecdotes that will appeal to anyone&#x2014;whether you're a major league couch potato, life-long season ticket-holder, or a beginner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is the difference between a slider and a curveball?</p><p>At which stadium did &#x201c;The Wave&#x201d; first make an appearance?</p><p>How do some hitters use iPods to improve their skills?</p><p>Which positions are never<i> </i>played by lefties?</p><p>Why do some players urinate on their hands?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combining the narrative voice and attitude of Michael Lewis with the compulsive brilliance of <i>Schott&#x2019;s Miscellany</i>, <i>Watching Baseball Smarter </i>will increase your understanding and enjoyment of the sport&#x2013;no matter what your level of expertise.</p>Features an glossary of baseball slang, an appendix of important baseball stats, and an appendix of uniform numbers.</p><p>Zack Hample has written three books about baseball and has appeared on dozens of TV and radio shows.

First of all, you get to hang out with other major leaguers. You also get to be on TV every day and play in front of thousands of people. You get to see your name in newspapers and magazines and on the back of people's T-shirts. You get to see your face on scoreboards and baseball cards and posters. You get free equipment from sporting goods companies. You get unlimited bubble gum and sunflower seeds in the dugout. You get to relax in the clubhouse and watch big-screen TVs from fancy leather couches while other people get paid to wash your uniform. You get to fly on private jets and stay in nice hotels. You get recognized by kids and pretty women who scream for autographs. Sometimes old men scream too. You earn an average annual salary of $2.9 million (or roughly $17,900 per game), and when the team travels, you get over $75 extra every day to spend on food.<br><br>No wonder the dream starts early.<br><br>But is it simply about fame and money? Maybe it's about having the chance to do something spectacular in one instant that people will always remember. Maybe it's about a subconscious desire to play a game full-time and act like a little boy well into adulthood. Maybe it's about having the manager and trainer race onto the field to make sure you're okay after you hit a foul ball off your ankle.<br><br>The motivation is almost irrelevant because every kid with the dream wants it bad. Every kid has a reason. Every kid has a story. Every kid has a good baseball name. Every kid practices his swing in the mirror. Every kid can steal a base and catch a fly ball and throw strikes. Every kid converts his statistics into a 600-at-bat season and concludes that he'll be a superstar in the majors. Every kid is sure he's gonna make it--and 99,999 out of 100,000 kids are wrong. They don't know how much better the competition gets every step of the way. They don't know how long the journey takes. They don't know that there's always some other kid with an edge. Someone is always taller, stronger, faster, smarter. Someone has quicker feet and softer hands and sharper eyes and better instincts. Someone runs more. Someone lifts weights more. Someone is using steroids. Someone's father is a baseball coach. Someone's older brother is already playing pro ball. Someone has a batting tee in the basement or a batting cage in the backyard. Someone lives in warmer weather and gets to practice year-round. Someone wants it more than anyone on earth has ever wanted it.<br><br>There's T-ball, Wiffle ball, softball, and Little League. There are baseball camps, baseball schools, private lessons, and winter clinics in stuffy gymnasiums. There's high school ball, college ball, summer ball, and fall ball. There's Babe Ruth League, the Cape Cod League, semipro leagues, and independent leagues. There are scouts, agents, tryouts, strikeouts, errors, cuts, injuries, surgeries, and lifelong dreams that can die in an instant.<br><br>But every year, the dream stays alive for 1,500 young men, at least for a little while, when they're selected by major league organizations in the First-Year Player Draft.<br><br>THE DRAFT<br><br>Basketball players regularly jump directly from high school to the NBA. Football players push right through college to the NFL. But baseball players have it much harder--as do the scouts who discover them. Almost all players start their careers in the Minor Leagues because their talent is less predictable and takes longer to develop.<br><br>Each June the ongoing search for talent begins a new cycle with the 50-round draft. Every major league team employs dozens of scouts who focus on North American players--mostly high school and college graduates--who are eligible for the draft. Now that baseball is spreading internationally, scouts also comb the rest of the globe for prospects who can sign outside of the draft as free agents if they're at least 16 years old. But the draft supplies more future major leaguers than any other talent pool.<br><br>Teams are assigned an order for selecting players, based on the previous season's won-lost records. The lousier teams get the higher picks. (Some people wonder if teams prefer to finish last once the season starts going downhill.)<br><br>The draft serves two purposes: to distribute the talent evenly and to keep signing bonuses from surging. Players are not free agents in the draft. They are forced to negotiate only with the team that selects them. If a player refuses an offer, he must wait a year and reenter the draft.<br><br>Even though every kid dreams of playing in the big leagues, it's not always easy for a team to complete the deal with a player it has drafted. For example, a high school star who's offered a $10,000 signing bonus for his 16th-round selection might also have heard from dozens of colleges that offered him full scholarships and a chance to play on their Division I teams. He may choose to stay in school, knowing that his skills could improve so much in four years that he might eventually be a first-round draft pick and earn a multimillion-dollar signing bonus. And if his future professional team pays him that much, the organization will stick with him if he struggles and give him all the instruction, attention, and support he needs to reach the majors.<br><br>Scouts look for intangibles like maturity, aggressiveness, and baseball instincts. When it comes to finding position players, a scout's Holy Grail is the five-tool player, the five tools being the ability to field well, throw hard, run fast, hit home runs, and hit for a high batting average. Barry Bonds, in his prime, was the ultimate five-tool player.<br><br>With pitchers, scouts look for velocity and accuracy, but they don't just want throwers; they want pitchers who use their heads and have a game plan. Left-handers are always in demand because their pitches naturally have more movement--no one's really sure why--and because they're more effective against left-handed hitters. Teams seek tall pitchers, not only because their big bodies are more durable, but because their long arms allow them to release the ball closer to home plate, giving hitters less time to react. Tall guys also have better leverage, meaning their higher release points allow them to throw with a greater downward angle for more velocity. Look at any team's roster and you'll notice that there aren't many players--especially pitchers--under six feet tall.<br><br>THE ROAD TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES<br><br>Of the tens of thousands of players selected since the draft began in 1965, fewer than two dozen have jumped directly to the majors. Mike Adamson became the first in 1967 when the Baltimore Orioles plucked him from the University of Southern California. Dave Winfield is the lone Hall of Famer on the list, but there are other big names, such as Burt Hooton, Dick Ruthven, Mike Morgan, Bob Horner, Pete Incaviglia, John Olerud, Chan Ho Park, and one-handed pitcher Jim Abbott.<br><br>Everyone else faces the ugly reality of life in the Minor Leagues. During homestands, some players live with host families who volunteer through their teams. On the road, all players endure endless bus rides, stay at cheap hotels, and receive a measly $20 a day for meals. They earn a maximum of $850 per month during their first season at the bottom of the professional baseball totem pole--and most of them couldn't be happier.<br><br>Most teams' minor league systems have these six levels, each divided into several leagues:<br><br>LEVELLEAGUE NAMES<br>RookieAppalachian, Arizona, Gulf Coast, Pioneer<br>Class A Short-SeasonNew York-Penn, Northwest<br>Class AMidwest, South Atlantic<br>Class A AdvancedCalifornia, Carolina, Florida State<br>Double-AEastern, Southern, Texas<br>Triple-AInternational, Pacific Coast<br><br>The Detroit Tigers, for example, have a Rookie team in the Gulf Coast League, a Class A Short-Season team in the New York-Penn League, a Class A team in the Midwest League, a Class A Advanced team in the Florida State League, a Double-A team in the Eastern League, and a Triple-A team in the International League.<br><br>When advancing to Triple-A, the highest level before the majors, players face a significant competitive jump because the rosters include many former major leaguers (and current ones recovering from injuries on rehab assignments) who are trying to get back to The Show.<br><br>Skipping a higher level of the Minor Leagues is rare; most players advance one level at a time only after demonstrating that they're better than most of the competition. So think twice before you yell, "He stinks!" about any major leaguer; he's spent his entire life beating the odds and proving himself as the best of the best of the best of the best of the best.<br><br>Players and scouts often mention that it's more difficult to make it from the minors to the majors than it is to get drafted in the first place. Of the minor leaguers who do reach the majors, many get just a cup of coffee before fading into oblivion--but even they get their names in the Baseball Encyclopedia. Most minor leaguers never make it and get released when their organizations give up on them (if they don't get discouraged and quit on their own). Still, they'll always be able to say that they played professional baseball.<br><br>LEAGUES, DIVISIONS, AND TEAMS<br><br>Major League Baseball (MLB) has 30 teams and two leagues. The National League (NL) and American League (AL) each have three divisions called the East, Central, and West. Take a look at the breakdown:<br><br>NL EASTNL CENTRALNL WEST<br>Atlanta BravesChicago CubsArizona Diamondbacks<br>Florida MarlinsCincinnati RedsColorado Rockies<br>New York MetsHouston AstrosLos Angeles Dodgers<br>Philadelphia PhilliesMilwaukee BrewersSan Diego Padres<br>Washington NationalsPittsburgh PiratesSan Francisco Giants<br>St. Louis Cardinals <br><br>AL EASTAL CENTRALAL WEST<br>Baltimore OriolesChicago White SoxLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim <br>Boston Red SoxCleveland IndiansOakland Athletics<br>New York YankeesDetroit TigersSeattle Mariners <br>Tampa Bay Devil RaysKansas City RoyalsTexas Rangers<br>Toronto Blue JaysMinnesota Twins<br><br>Before 1997, teams played only within their league during the regular season. Then baseball officials introduced interleague play. The new matchups, though limited to just a handful of games each year, boosted attendance but angered purists who felt that the World Series should have remained the only meeting between the leagues. Many people think it's odd that the NL has two more teams than the AL, but if each had 15, the odd number would force one team in each league to either play an interleague game or take a day off every day.<br><br>The major difference between the leagues is the designated hitter (DH). In the National League, the pitcher, like everyone else who plays the field, has a spot in the batting order. In the American League, the DH bats for him. In interleague play, All-Star Games, and the World Series, the home team's ballpark determines the DH rule. Why does the AL have a DH? Good question. After fans supposedly got bored seeing pitchers dominate the sport in the 1960s, the American League adopted the DH in 1973 to bolster offense and attendance; the National League voted against it and still drew more fans than the AL.<br><br>(In order to call yourself a baseball fan, you must have an opinion on the designated hitter; you either love that it creates more offense by replacing weak-hitting pitchers with full-time sluggers or you hate that it eliminates the late-inning strategy of dealing with those pitchers. If a guy is pitching well, should the manager let him bat in a crucial situation so he can return to the mound for another inning or two? Or should the manager use a pinch-hitter and turn the ball over to the bullpen? These decisions don't exist in the AL.)<br><br>SPRING TRAINING<br><br>After each dreary off-season, baseball comes back to life in mid-February when pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training. All other players show up five days later because, quite simply, their positions are less demanding and don't require the extra work.<br><br>In the old days, players used Spring Training to get in shape for the regular season. Nowadays, everyone arrives in top physical condition. Superstars want to prove that they deserve their salaries, while many other players compete to make the team and avoid beginning the season in the minors.<br><br>There's no NL or AL in the preseason (but the home team still determines the DH rule). Instead, 18 of the 30 major league teams, mostly from the East and Central Divisions, play in Florida in the Grapefruit League. The other 12 teams, mostly from the West, play in Arizona in the Cactus League.<br><br>THE REGULAR SEASON<br><br>For most teams, the 162-game regular season begins on the first Monday in April and ends either on the last Sunday in September or the first in October. Major League Baseball uses an unbalanced schedule, which means that teams don't all face each other the same number of times. Instead, they play more games within their divisions. Teams sometimes complain that their road trips are too long, that they don't play a particular divisional rival until July, or that they lose money when the popular matchups take place in the other team's ballpark. Too bad. The schedule makers organize 2,430 games each season and can't please everyone.<br><br>Teams don't always finish the season having played exactly 162 games. They may play one fewer when a meaningless late-season contest gets rained out and can't be rescheduled. Or if two teams are tied after 162 games with one postseason slot remaining, there are certain circumstances that would force an extra one-game playoff, creating a rare 163-game season.<br><br>THE POSTSEASON<br><br>Let's start from the beginning. The first World Series was played in 1903 as a best-of-nine contest, and the Boston Americans (who became the Red Sox five years later) beat the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three. All other World Series have been best-of-seven, except those from 1919 to 1921, which reverted to the original format. The Series used to be the only postseason matchup; there were no divisions, so the first-place teams in each league played each other after the regular season and wham! that was it.<br><br>Divisional play began in 1969 when the leagues divided into East and West.

W. Brands shows how Roosevelt transformed American government during the Depression with his New Deal legislation, and carefully managed the country's prelude to war. Brands shows how Roosevelt's friendship and regard for Winston Churchill helped to forge one of the greatest alliances in history, as Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin maneuvered to defeat Germany and prepare for post-war Europe.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, November 2008</strong>: With <em>Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em>, H.W. Brands penetrates the clenched grin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a masterful biography of one of America's most beloved leaders. Though born into the upper crust of society, FDR dedicated his career to fighting for the common good and the ideals of the American Dream. With the same exhaustive research familiar to fans of his biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Jackson, Brands provides a portrait of an unflinching (and often recalcitrant) figure whose unshakable confidence inspired a beleaguered nation. FDR's path may have been unorthodox (evidenced by an unprecedented 12 years spent as commander-in-chief) and arguably illegal (the New Deal didn't always work well with the Constitution), but his shared goal of a stronger America at home and abroad endeared him to voters of varying backgrounds. "We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern," proclaimed Roosevelt in 1937. "The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little." -- <em>-Dave Callanan</em><p>H. W.

Her twenty-eight books include poetry, essays, and children&#39;s books. A beloved teacher and exuberant activist, she founded Poetry For the People, and was a regular columnist for The Progressive and a prolific writer whose articles appeared in The Village Voice, The New York Times, Ms., and Essence. She died of breast cancer in 2002.As fierce in her activist life as in her passionate verse, Jordan (1936&#x2013;2002) first rose to fame in the early '70s with declamatory poems and series inspired by African-American vernacular: "Who look at me?" her first series demanded; "I am black alive and looking back at you." A flexible metrical sense, and an undercurrent of humor, set her best work apart from her performance-oriented peers early on; Jordan later expanded her range with travel (in a series of poems about life in Rome), with persona poems and satire ("Directions for Carrying Explosive Nuclear Waste Through Metropolitan New York"; "The Beirut Jokebook") During the '80s, Jordan (<i>Naming Our Destiny</i>) often focused on international struggles, praising revolutionaries and peace activists in Cuba, Angola, Nicaragua and Israel/Palestine, and excoriating American militarism and racism. She later became a professor at the University of California&#x2013;Berkeley, assembling an influential book on the teaching of poetry (<i>June Jordan's Poetry for the People: A Revolutionary Blueprint</i>) and a widely noticed memoir, <i>Soldier: A Poet's Childhood</i> (2000). This ample collection concludes with 62 pages of "last poems": several concern the cancer that took Jordan's life, and one of the best sasses back at Eminem. Adrienne Rich's foreword praises this "most personal of political poets" for her verbal power and for her commitment to justice: her loyal following will certainly agree. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her heart has stopped beating but her brain is still active-for 10 minutes 38 seconds. While the Turkish sun rises and her friends sleep soundly nearby, she remembers her life-and the lives of others, outcasts like her. </p><p>Tequila Leila's memories bring us back to her childhood in the provinces, a highly oppressive milieu with religion and traditions, shaped by a polygamous family with two mothers and an increasingly authoritarian father. Escaping to Istanbul, Leila makes her way into the sordid industry of sex trafficking, finding a home in the city's historic Street of Brothels. This is a dark, violent world, but Leila is tough and open to beauty, light, and the essential bonds of friendship. </p><p>In Tequila Leila's death, the secrets and wonders of modern Istanbul come to life, painted vividly by the captivating tales of how Leila came to know and be loved by her friends. As her epic journey to the afterlife comes to an end, it is her chosen family who brings her story to a buoyant and breathtaking conclusion.</p></p><p><b>Elif Shafak</b> is an award-winning British-Turkish novelist and the most widely read female author in Turkey.

Scientific studies continue to confirm its validity, and medical doctors are regularly prescribing treatments such as acupuncture to their patients. But even for those of us who have benefitted from such treatments, the question remains: what exactly is energy medicine, and how does it work?</p><p>Acupuncturist and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) scholar Jill Blakeway has been treating patients for more than twenty-five years. For Jill, the term &#x201c;energy medicine&#x201d; refers to the wide range of healing modalities used to diagnose and treat illness by manipulating the energy&#x2014;the vital life force referred to as &#x201c;qi&#x201d; in TCM&#x2014;that pulses through the cells of our bodies. But even this seasoned practitioner admits she doesn&#x2019;t truly understand how some of her patients are healed under her care, and retains a healthy skepticism about her own abilities as well those of her peers. </p><p>In <em>Energy Medicine</em>, Jill invites us on her global journey to better understand, apply, and explain this powerful healing force. Moving from her own clinic to the halls of academia, she talks to top healers, researchers, and practitioners&#x2014;from the Stanford and Princeton professors researching the physics behind energy medicine and healing; to a Chinese Qi Gong master who manifests healing herbs directly from her palm; to a team of skeptical scientists who use &#x201c;hands on&#x201d; healing to repeatedly cure mammary cancer in mice.

Studies out of top academic and medical institutions are validating its curative powers, consumers are increasingly curious about alternative healing modalities, and medical doctors are regularly prescribing energy treatments, such as acupuncture, to their patients. But despite this rise in both popularity and acceptance, the field remains shrouded in mystery. What exactly is energy medicine, and how does it work?</p><p>Acupuncturist and traditional Chinese medicine scholar Jill Blakeway has been treating patients with energy medicine&#x2014;often in conjunction with conventional Western medicine&#x2014;for more than twenty-five years. By her definition, energy medicine refers to the wide range of healing methods used to diagnose and treat illness by manipulating the energy that pulses through every cell of the body. But even Jill admits that there is an element to her practice that lies just beyond comprehension. As such, while she is a sought-after and gifted healer, she has always remained just a tiny bit skeptical of her own abilities, not to mention those of others in her field.</p><p>In <em>Energy Medicine</em>, Blakeway invites readers along on her journey to better understand her craft. With access to scientists at leading universities as well as proponents of energy medicine from across the discipline, Jill offers an exclusive, one-of-a-kind exploration and analysis of this powerful practice.

Written by his wife, Alice, also a highly respected Catholic thinker, this is a fascinating, moving and, at times, gripping account of a truly great man of the Church who suffered much for the faith. Based on a very long letter Dietrich wrote to his wife late in his life, it tells his story from his glorious youth with a unique intellectual and cultural formation, his coversion to Catholisism, his great passion for truth and beauty, his extensive writing on Christian philosophy and theology, and his steadfast, determined opposition to Nazism that made him a marked man who miraculously escaped execution. A powerful biography of a relentless fighter against injustice, a devoted son of the Church, a man who had the soul of a lion.

He was much influenced by the events of the French Revolution in his youth, and he deliberately broke away from the artificial diction of the Augustan and neo-classical tradition of the eighteenth century. He sought to write in the language of ordinary men and women, of ordinary thoughts, sights and sounds, and his early poetry represents this fresh approach to his art. Wordsworth spent most of his adult life in the Lake District with his sister Dorothy and his wife Mary, by whom he had four children. His remarkable autobiographical poem The Prelude was completed in 1805, but was not published until after his death, and it is included in this full edition of Wordsworth&#39;s poetry.</p><p>William Wordsworth, one of the leaders of the Romantic Movement in English literature, first published &#34;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&#34; in 1807.

These poems can take the shape of manifestos, meditations, insults, Whitmanic fits and ravings&#x2015;these are often funny in spite of themselves. The Mad Farmer is a character as necessary, perhaps, as he is regrettable.</p> <p>Here are gathered the individual poems from Berry's various collections to offer the teachings of this amazing American voice. After the great success of the lovely <i>Window Poems</i>, Bob Baris of the Press on Scroll Road returns to design and produce an edition illustrated with etchings by Abigail Rover.

She's a princess, her father's firstborn and his chosen successor. Someday she expects to sit on the throne and rule the vast Byzantine Empire. So the birth of a baby brother doesn't perturb her. Nor do the "barbarians" from foreign lands, who think only a son should ascend to power. Anna is as dismissive of them as are her father and his most trusted adviser--his mother, a manipulative woman with whom Anna studies the art of diplomacy. Anna relishes her lessons, proving adept at checkmating opponents in swift moves of mental chess. But as she matures into a young woman, her arrogance and intelligence threaten her grandmother. Anna will be no one's puppet. Almost overnight, Anna sees her dreams of power wrenched from her and bestowed on her little brother.

She's a princess, her father's firstborn and his chosen successor. Someday she expects to sit on the throne and rule the vast Byzantine Empire. The birth of a baby brother doesn't perturb her. Nor do the "barbarians" from foreign lands, who think only a son should ascend to power. Anna is as dismissive of them as are her father and his most trusted advisor -- his mother, a manipulative woman with whom Anna studies the art of diplomacy.<p>Anna relishes her lessons, proving adept at checkmating opponents in swift games of mental chess. But as she matures into a young woman, her arrogance and intelligence threaten her grandmother. Anna will be no one's puppet. Almost overnight, Anna sees her dreams of power wrenched from her and bestowed on her little brother. Bitter at the betrayal, Anna waits to avenge herself and to seize what is rightfully hers.</p>Tracy Barrett is the author of numerous books and magazine articles for young readers.

Eadie, Raymond Moody, and Brian Weiss in its power to comfort, uplift, and transform our thinking about life after death</p><p>Everyone I&#39;ve talked to about this book loved it as much as I did. While I was reading, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, not from fright, but from the emotional charge. It makes sense that children are likely to remember past lives as their open minds allow them to experience a trance state that adults have to practice to achieve, and maybe more children relive their former lives than we think. Carol Bowman gives us a guide for recognizing and handling such episodes. She writes not just as a researcher, but as a mother who has seen her own children go through the experience.Chase had a terrible fear of loud noises that would send him into uncontrollable fits of tears. His mother, author Carol Bowman, could find no rational explanation for her son's behavior and decided to try an experimental procedure, allowing Chase to experience past life regression. She was shocked to hear her red-haired, freckle-faced son describe, in accurate detail, how he was an African American soldier who fought in the Civil War and died on the battlefields. He spoke of the rifles, of being wounded, of missing his wife and children, of wishing he had not volunteered to fight, of the loud sounds of shots ringing out incessant thunderous outbursts, and of dying. After Chase remembered this past life, his fear of loud noises utterly disappeared. <p></p><p>Chase's experience, and its beneficial outcome, led Bowman to begin research on children's past life memories. In this book, she offers the fascinating, startling, and truly incredible true stories of children who remember their past lives, including the experiences of her own son and daughter, and the past life regression she recalled herself. The book also offers advice to readers, illustrating how to detect clues to past life awareness, how to trigger past life memories, and how to use those memories to reap the full benefits of health and self-understanding for the child. Finally this is a book of inspiration that strongly supports a belief in reincarnation. Bowman demonstrates how the past influences the present, how we can learn to understand the realm of the spiritual, enter into that world to discover the immutable nature of the soul and explore the essence of life, death and the spaces in between.</p></p><h2>Johannes Brahms Complete Symphonies in Full Score (Vienna Gesellschaft Der Musikfreunde Edition)</h2><p><p>This volume reproduces, complete and unabridged, the scores of all four symphonies of Johannes Brahms, from the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Edition edited by Hans G�l.<br>Included are <i>Symphony No. 1 in C Minor</i>, Op. 68; <i>Symphony No. 2 in D Major</i>, Op. 73; <i>Symphony No. 3 in F Major</i>, Op. 90; and <i>Symphony No. 4 in E Minor</i>, Op. 98. <br>Do not confuse this with a piano rendering; it is a full orchestral score.

For more than three centuries, adults have agonized over raising children while children have followed their own paths to development and expression. Now, Steven Mintz gives us the first comprehensive history of American childhood encompassing both the child's and the adult's tumultuous early years of life.</p><p>Underscoring diversity through time and across regions, Mintz traces the transformation of children from the sinful creatures perceived by Puritans to the productive workers of nineteenth-century farms and factories, from the cosseted cherubs of the Victorian era to the confident consumers of our own. He explores their role in revolutionary upheaval, westward expansion, industrial growth, wartime mobilization, and the modern welfare state. Revealing the harsh realities of children's lives through history&#x2015;the rigors of physical labor, the fear of chronic ailments, the heartbreak of premature death&#x2015;he also acknowledges the freedom children once possessed to discover their world as well as themselves. </p><p>Whether at work or play, at home or school, the transition from childhood to adulthood has required generations of Americans to tackle tremendously difficult challenges. Today, adults impose ever-increasing demands on the young for self-discipline, cognitive development, and academic achievement, even as the influence of the mass media and consumer culture has grown. With a nod to the past, Mintz revisits an alternative to the goal-driven realities of contemporary childhood. An odyssey of psychological self-discovery and growth, this book suggests a vision of childhood that embraces risk and freedom&#x2015;like the daring adventure on Huck's raft.</p></p><p>Steven Mintz is Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin and Executive Director of the University of Texas System&#x2019;s Institute for Transformational Learning.All of us recognize that our childhoods were different from those of our parents. How could we not? Parents are constantly reminding their offspring of this very fact: "You kids today don't know the value of a dollar. . . . Do you and your brothers think money grows on trees? . . . All you teenagers care about are clothes. . . . There's more to life than just playing the guitar. . . . Girls used to have a sense of modesty. . . . Boys tried to earn their father's respect. . . ." And so on.<p>I heard phrases like this when growing up and, to my astonishment, find myself mouthing similar ones to my own sons. I used to assume this was something hormonal -- that adults were obliged by their aging biology to look upon youth as feckless, irresponsible and profoundly annoying. No doubt envy plays its part too. Unlike us, the young have yet to squander their lives. So we lay into them, hoping to rescue the apparent yahoos from their downward slide and somehow transform them into what they really ought to be -- which is roughly ourselves, but better, smarter, richer. Sadly, we grownups can't help these shameful desires. To feel proud of one's children -- this is the drug that every parent hungers after. Only when the kids start to disappoint our expectations, as must eventually happen, do we settle for wanting them to be merely happy.</p><p> This view of children as "social capital" lies at the heart of upper- and middle-class attitudes toward the young. By contrast, the children of the indigent have traditionally been thought an integral part of a familial work force and used as physical or financial helps in life's bitter struggle. "Far less sentimental in their conception of childhood," writes historian Steven Mintz, the poor "did not believe that parents should make economic sacrifices for their children without reciprocal labor from their offspring." Alas, this belief (or need) often led to the sacrifice of young lives to hardscrabble farming and factory sweatshops. Under such conditions kids didn't necessarily grow up, but they certainly grew old, old before their time.</p><p>What do we expect of our children? This is the social question at the heart of Huck's Raft. Among the Puritans a family's paramount obligation was to ensure the spiritual well-being of its young souls. What else could be of any earthly, let alone heavenly, importance? Among baby boomers today, our main goal is to do everything possible to guarantee that Jared or Chelsea is admitted to Yale. The outlook has changed, but whether for the better is moot: What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his immortal soul?</p><p>As Mintz reminds us, middle-class adults have never been sure whether to protect their children from harsh realities or to prepare them to face life's challenges and ugliness. In the past, the young seldom had these options. Ask the worn-out 10-year-olds who went down into coal mines, or the school-age African Americans forced to watch their fathers and mothers kowtow to vulgar rednecks. The idyllic Norman Rockwell/Andy Hardy childhood is largely a post-World War II myth.</p><p>That said, the children of the past did possess something lost to their descendants of today: freedom. Once kids were allowed to ride their bikes all over town or idle away the summer in daydreams; they could fail a course or even a grade, and no one got overly excited about it; they might even make serious mistakes and find themselves pregnant or working on the line at Ford rather than studying lines of poetry at college. But now, in our test-driven, increasingly regimented educational system, we forthrightly aim to leave no child behind, which means that we leave no child alone. Slow learners must be sped up, dreamy kids must be made to focus, all must wear uniforms, and, eventually, all must have prizes -- or at least AP courses. In the past, parents might exploit their kids as little more than indentured servants or simply ignore them. Today we are their chauffeurs and social secretaries. Little wonder that teenagers complain they are bored, with nothing to do. But when have they ever done anything for themselves?</p><p>Once, writes Mintz, the "path to adulthood was far less clearly delineated and much more irregular, haphazard, and episodic than it subsequently became." He adds sadly that contemporary "American society is unique in its assumption that all young people should follow a single, unitary path to adulthood," then calls for us to review the current totalitarian approach to maturation. "Our challenge is to reverse the process of age segmentation, to provide the young with challenging alternatives to a world of malls, instant messaging, music videos, and play dates. Huck Finn was an abused child whose father, the town drunk, beat him for going to school and learning to read. Who would envy Huck's battered childhood? Yet he enjoyed something too many children are denied and which adults can provide: opportunities to undertake odysseys of self-discovery outside the goal-driven, overstructured realities of contemporary childhood." </p><p>Mintz presents this wise counsel only after more than 350 information-filled pages about children during the American Revolution, under slavery, during the early industrial period, the Progressive Era and the Great Depression. He touches on sexuality and vice -- "In New York City in the middle of the nineteenth century, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of young women in their teens or early twenties engaged in prostitution for at least a brief period" -- and notes that as "late as 1900, 20 to 30 percent of all children had lost a parent by age fifteen." Even "as late as 1920, only 16 percent of seventeen-year-olds -- less than one in six -- graduated from high school." He ends by describing the imprisonment of the Scottsboro Boys, the Leopold-Loeb thrill murder, the shootings at Columbine.</p><p> Though Mintz writes clearly, his pages can make for slow reading: Virtually every sentence tots up another historical anecdote, fact, statistic or datum of some sort, making the pages feel like lists -- fascinating lists, admittedly, but lists all the same. Still, he occasionally pauses during his positivistic barrage for a more reflective paragraph. For instance, he notes that in the 19th century, children organized their own sports teams, clubs and educational associations like the Mechanics Institute -- without adult aid or supervision. But as "high schools grew more important as placement agencies and assumed a more all-encompassing role in middle-class lives, students began to see themselves as juveniles and became more and more acquiescent. It seemed appropriate that adults who knew better should organize their leisure as well as their academic activities." As our century advanced, he also notes (with, perhaps, an implied private conviction) that a "concern with personality development replaced an earlier preoccupation with shaping children's moral character." </p><p>This is, then, a rich and stimulating book, revealing how much childhood has changed over the centuries and how much some things never change. Mintz notes that Cornelia A.P. Comer, a Harvard professor's wife, complained in the Atlantic Monthly that the younger generation "couldn't spell, and its English was 'slipshod.' Today's youth were selfish, discourteous, lazy, and self-indulgent. Lacking respect for their elders or for common decency, the young were hedonistic, 'shallow, amusement-seeking creatures,' whose tastes had been 'formed by the colored supplements of the Sunday paper' and the 'moving picture shows.' The boys were feeble, flippant, and 'soft' intellectually, spiritually, and physically. Even worse were the girls, who were brash, loud, and promiscuous with young men." This was published in 1911, but it could be -- old-fashioned diction aside -- Tom Wolfe inveighing against college freshmen in 2004. Sigh. I suppose that every generation of adults tends to feel, when regarding the young people around them, that the barbarians are at the gates. But really, there's nothing for us to worry about: One day our children will have children of their own. </p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

It&#x2019;s a network of interrelated skills, processes and strategies that build value in a business while making it manageable, scalable and ensuring the owner runs the business and not the other way around.</p> <p>Duncan MacPherson and Pareto Systems have been in the forefront of practice management in the realm of the professional advisor for a quarter-century. Chris Jeppesen of First Trust brings his own decades of professional knowledge to the table. The processes in <strong><em>The Advisor Playbook</em></strong> have grown over those years, through constant refinement and improvement. They&#x2019;ll help you to perform that same refinement and improvement on your business, and regain liberation and order in your personal and professional life.</p> <p>As you progress through the book, you&#x2019;ll realize that each process is implemented in synergy with every other. Referrals are influenced by your service which is influenced by your process, which is influenced by your philosophy, which is influenced by your ideal client definition, life and business goals. Nothing exists in a vacuum, and everything is, in the end, focused on a single unwavering goal: To build real, advocate relationships with your ideal clients that will generate both growth through referrals and the capacity for that growth.</p> <p>How you are perceived is key in every step of that circle, and readers who take on board what the <em><strong>Playbook</strong> </em>outlines will come away with an understanding of how they are perceived, how to cast themselves as a consultant with a process rather than a salesperson with a quota, and will set a constantly rising bar for their own success.</p> <p>You&#x2019;ll be amazed at how common-sense most of the processes and strategies seem, and probably horrified at how often you&#x2019;ve wandered from the path or failed to implement them due to a lack of clarity or simple distraction.</p> <p>The <em><strong>Playbook </strong></em>will guide you to an actionable plan and process that makes going to work a positive experience, and a positive investment.</p></p><p>I am the CEO of Pareto Systems, a practice management and business development consulting firm dedicated to improving the productivity of professional advisors.

The police conclude that Rogers died of natural causes, but Hugo is certain mischief is afoot. As he pokes around the library, Hugo discovers that rumors are swirling around some recently donated letters from American actress Isabelle Severin. The reason: they may indicate that the actress had aided the Resistance in frequent trips to France toward the end of World War II. Even more dramatic is the legend that the Severin collection also contains a dagger, one she used to kill an SS officer in 1944. Hugo delves deeper into the stacks at the American library and finally realizes that the history of this case isn&#x2019;t what anyone suspected. But to prove he&#x2019;s right, Hugo must return to the scene of a decades-old crime.</p><p>Mark Pryor is the author of the Hugo Marston novels The Bookseller, The Crypt Thief, The Blood Promise, The Button Man, and The Reluctant Matador, as well as the novels Hollow Man and Dominic.

Interest in the subject has grown significantly among professional archaeologists and informed lay persons in recent years, but the purpose and meaning that the intriguing symbols had for their creators remain a mystery. Although the significance of the symbols will never be known for certain, educated guesses can be made. The &#34;Field Guide&#34; brings together 600 commentaries on specific symbols by over one hundred archaeologists, anthropologists, researchers, and Native American informants. Intended to be used in the field, as well as a reference, the book includes a pictorial key at the beginning and is organized by tentative meaning or by description. The reader can easily find the one or several of the 500 illustrations that most closely match the symbol in question. Patterson emphasizes the tentative nature of the interpretations and has included an index by neutral archaeological description as well as complete documentation of every excerpted comment. The range of the book is from the northern states of Mexico to Utah and from California to Colorado.</p><p></p><h2>National Directory for Catechesis</h2><p>A companion to the General Directory for Catechesis (GDC), it builds on some of the core themes of the GDC like catechesis&#39;s relationship to evangelization and worship.</p><p>"For fostering faith itself, the 'National Directory of Catechesis' can help; authoritative, clear, and practical, it will assist catechesis at every level." (Rev. Philip C. Fischer, S.J. <i>Review for Religious</i> 20050701)<br><br>"This national directory is a companion to the <i>General Directory for Catechesis<i>. The bishops have intended this directory to be a reference resource for those responsible for catechesis from the bishops on down to those on the local level. Those preparing for ordination would also be interested in this directory. The purposes of the directory as stated by the authors are; first, to provide fundamental theological and pastoral principles and how to apply these to the pastoral activity of catechesis; second, to provide guidelines for application of those principles; and third, to help with the content and methodologies of catechesis (p. 17). This well-organized directory contains ten chapters, each subdivided, and a conclusion or summary is at the end of each chapter which is very helpful. There are several bibliographical footnotes and an index. Chapter one is an overview of the Church in the United States and its diversity. Chapter two discusses the tasks and proper role of catechesis. Chapters three and four discuss the sources of the Christian message and the methodology of presenting it. Chapter five discusses the role of liturgy, the Sacraments, and worship has in catechesis. Chapter six discusses the catechtical principles and guidelines needed for both personal and social moral formation. Chapter seven is about how to catechize the People of God with its diversity of ages, nationalities, races, and other aspects. Chapter eight's focus is for catechists. Chapter nine defines how to organize catechetical ministry. Chapter ten discusses the various resources for catechesis and how to evaluate them. <i>The national Directory for Catechesis<i> is a Church document (which might be intimidating for some readers) full of information and material for meditation and prayer. All Catholics are called to evangelize or spread the Faith. This directory can be a helpful aid in this. It can also help us know more about our Faith and how to present it. This book of course is mainly for catechists who have the official ministry to catechize the People of God in whatever stage of life they are in. This directory has the approval of the U.S. bishops and of Rome." (Bro. Benet Exton, O.S.B. <i>Catholic Exchange</i> 20050802)<br><br>The expansion of the term catechetical leader is worth noting in the NDC. . . . A Catholic school superintendent by virtue of the catechetical responsibilities "is a diocesan catechetical leader." Since the Catholic school is a center for evangelization, the Catholic school principal is also a catechetical leader who "plays a crucial role in achieving the catechetical objectives of the parish." . . . With the emergence of the NDC, all catechetical leaders are asked to engage in some reflection. In music, harmony requires the combination of simultaneous musical notes that are created according to the structure, relation, and progress of chords. . . . The NDC calls our attention to elements in our work that can help effect a melodic symphony. (Diana Raiche <i>National Catholic Educational Association</i> 20051101)<br><br>"This is the long awaited companion volume to the <i>General Directory for Catechesis<i>. It builds on the original work and also serves as a reference point for the formation of catechists and the development of programs and resource. The Introduction underlines the importance of this essential ministry of teaching the Gospel message and also outlines the renewal of catechetics called for by the Second Vatican Council. The book optimistically describes the current catechetical situation and the challenges to catechesis in our world today. The introduction closes with a statement of the Bishops' purposes for the Directory. The book goes on to provide information on the general character and diversity of U.S. culture and catechesis and evangelizaion. The <i>National Directory for Catechesis<i> needs to be in every parish library and available to religious education directors and teachers in the United States.

It's all in a normal night's work for Anna, who leads the Night Crew, a freelance video team out to make a quick buck on sensational footage they can sell to L.A. news stations. But this night is different: the jumper is a teenager named Jacob Harper, and Anna's cameraman Jason beats a strangely hasty exit after filming the jump. A few hours later, Jason too is dead: shot and knifed.<p> Jacob Harper's father is an attractive former cop who works out the connection between his son's death and Jason's. The two young men share a drug dealer--and when Harper finds said dealer dead as well, he calls Anna to the scene and shows her a creepy knife wound on the dealer's body: the name "Anna" carved into his chest. From that moment on, Anna knows she's chasing down a killer who's got a thing for her--but who is it? A series of heart-thumping encounters between Anna and her shadowy stalker keep this thriller moving at the dizzying clip that Sandford's fans expect.</p><p> Those who love the Prey series for the quirks and contradictions of its antihero, Lucas Davenport, will find a kindred creation in Anna: an attractive loner, taciturn and tough-minded, a classical pianist with the fighting reflexes of a wild animal.

Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach expounds on an often-overlooked tool that can be key in solving this problem. A screenplay can be understood as being built of sequences of about fifteen pages each, and by focusing on solving the dramatic aspects of each of these sequences in detail, a writer can more easily conquer the challenges posed by the script as a whole. </p><p>The sequence approach has its foundation in early Hollywood cinema (until the 1950s, most screenplays were formatted with sequences explicitly identified), and has been rediscovered and used effectively at such film schools as the University of Southern California, Columbia University and Chapman University. This book exposes a wide audience to the approach for the first time, introducing the concept then providing a sequence analysis of eleven significant feature films made between 1940 and 2000: </p><p>The Shop Around The Corner / Double Indemnity / Nights of Cabiria / North By Northwest / Lawrence of Arabia / The Graduate / One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest / Toy Story / Air Force One / Being John Malkovich / The Fellowship of the Ring</p></p><p>Paul Gulino is Assistant Professor of Screenwriting at Chapman University, USA."With a fresh take on the oft-mystifying subject of screenplay structure, Gulino breaks some new ground in what I like to call 'screenwriteology'....the analyses are detailed, clear and insightful....In conclusion, if you're slaving for answers about structure, there's plenty to digest in The Sequence Approach.

"The sensor shroud shows at least seven ships in orbit around Yavin 4 and another six on the surface."<br><br>"None of them are Yuuzhan Vong, I take it."<br><br>"No. A mixed bag, but I'd lay odds that they are Peace Brigade."<br><br>"Gambling is a foolish occupation," Karrde said. "I want to know. And I want to know what they're doing." He ticked his finger against the armrest. "I knew we should have found some way to leave sooner. Skywalker was right." He sighed and leaned forward, studying the long-range sensors.<br><br>"There's some sort of firefight on the surface, yes, <br>H'sishi?"<br><br>"Looks like it," the Togorian mewled.<br><br>"Solusar?" Karrde wondered. "Maybe. How long before we can be there?"<br><br>"They outnumber us badly," Shada pointed out. "We should call the rest of our ships before we do anything."<br><br>"We should certainly call them, but we can't wait for them. Someone down there is fighting for his life, most likely one of the people I told Skywalker I would protect. What's more, the fact that there are still ships on the surface suggests they haven't finished what they came here to do. That is, they don't have the Jedi children yet. If we wait until they have them aboard, in space, the job of rescuing them will become much more complicated."<br><br>"I see that," Shada said. "But it will be more complicated yet if they blow us out of the sky."<br><br>Karrde laughed. "Shada, when will you learn to trust my instincts? When have I ever gotten you killed?"<br><br>"YOu have a point there, I suppose."<br><br>Karrde pointed at Yavin 4, at the moment a dark disk silhouetted against the larger orange profile of its primary. "So I want to be there, now. Dankin, keep full cloak, but let me know when they notice us."<br><br>"Of course, sir."<br>That point came an hour later, when they were almost sitting on the nearest of the orbiting ships.<br><br>"They're hailing us, sir," Dankin told him. "And powering up weapons."<br><br>"Put them on."<br><br>A moment later, a thick-featured human male with thin, graying hair appeared on the communication holoscreen.<br><br>"Freighter, identify yourself." He chopped the words out in even syllables.<br><br>"My name, sir, is Talon Karrde. Perhaps you've heard of me."<br><br>The man's eyes pinched warily. "Yes, I've heard of you, Captain Karrde. It's rude to sneak up on someone like that. And dangerous."<br><br>"And it's rude to be given a name and not offer one," Karrde returned.<br><br>A look of annoyance crossed the fellow's face. "Don't try me, Captain Karrde. You may call me Captain Imsatad. What do you want?"<br><br>Karrde favored the man with a wan smile. "I was going to ask you the same question."<br><br>"I don't follow you," Imsatad said.<br><br>"You seem to be having some sort of trouble. I'm offering my assistance."<br><br>"We need no assistance, I assure you. And to be blunt, Captain Karrde, I don't believe you. I remember you as a smuggler, a pirate, and a traitor to the Empire."<br><br>"Then perhaps you remember, as well, what became of those who treated me with disrespect," Karrde said icily. "But if we are being blunt--and perhaps that is best here, since you seem to lack the education for more civilized discourse--I am undoubtedly here for the same reason you are--to collect the bounty on the young Jedi below."<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>Karrde leaned toward the screen, eyes glittering dangerously. "You are a liar, Captain, and a poor one. I see no reason for us to play games."<br><br>"I trust you've noticed you're outnumbered."<br><br>"I trust you noted I was able to drop in on you in, shall we say, an unannounced fashion. Do you really think I brought only one ship?"<br><br>Imsatad glared at him, then cut his visual. Karrde waited patiently until, a few moments later, the image <br>returned.<br>"This is none of your business," the man said.<br><br>"Profit is always my business."<br><br>"There is no profit here, and if there were, you would already be too late."<br><br>"Oh, I don't think so. Why are your ships still on the surface? Why do my sensors show what seems to be protracted search activity? You've let your quarry slip through your fingers, Captain." Karrde smiled and leaned back in his chair. "Consider my offer of help. I ask little in return, and I could be a nuisance if you spurn my kindness."<br><br>"That sounds like a threat."<br><br>Karrde spread his hands. "Take it however you please. Shall we discuss this further or not?"<br><br>"You say you ask for little. What, exactly, would <br>that be?"<br><br>"A few kind words in the ears of the Yuuzhan Vong. An introduction. You see, Captain, for some years now I've been retired from my chosen profession. But these are very interesting times, exactly the sort of times my kind thrives on, if you know what I mean. I'd like to come out of retirement."<br><br>"Go on."<br><br>Karrde stroked his mustache thoughtfully. "The Yuuzhan Vong have promised a truce if the Jedi are delivered to them. I would like to bargain for passage through Yuuzhan Vong space, once the borders are established."<br><br>"Why should they allow a smuggler to use their space?"<br><br>"There may be things they need. I can get them. If not, I would be doing them no harm; all of my activities would be aimed at the scattered remnants of the New Republic. But those remnants are separated, at times, by Yuuzhan Vong-occupied systems. The cost of circumventing them, frankly, would be prohibitive."<br><br>Imsatad nodded, and a brief look of disgust wrinkled his features. "I see. You realize I can promise none of that."<br><br>"I only asked for a mention of my help in this affair. You can promise that."<br><br>"I could," Imsatad acknowledged. "What exactly can you offer me?"<br><br>"Better sensors than you have, for one thing. Detailed knowledge of Yavin 4 that I believe you lack. A crew that is very, very good at finding things. Certain special defenses against Jedi--and the means of finding them."<br><br>Imsatad stiffened, and his voice dropped low. "I was with Thrawn at Wayland. You still? . . ."<br><br>"Ah. You know what I mean, then."<br><br>"I know you betrayed him."<br><br>Karrde rolled his eyes. "How tiresome. Very well, Captain, if you don't wish my services, there are others who will."<br><br>"Wait!" Imsatad chewed his lip for a moment. "I need to consult with my officers on this."<br><br>"Take a few moments," Karrde said, lifting a finger. "But do not bore me." He cut the transmission.</p><h2>Murder on a Girls&#39; Night Out: A Southern Sisters Mystery (Southern Sisters Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>A Different Kind of Sister Act</strong><p></p><p><em>Patricia Anne -- "Mouse" -- is respectful, respectable, and demure, a perfect example of genteel Southern womanhood. Mary Alice -- "Sister" -- is big, brassy, flamboyant, and bold. Together they have a knack for finding themselves in the center of some of Birmingham's most unfortunate unpleasantness.</em></p><p>Country Western is red hot these days, so overimpulsive Mary Alice thinks it makes perfect sense to buy the Skoot 'n' Boot bar -- since that's where the many-times-divorced "Sister" and her boyfriend du jour like to hang out anyway. Sensible retired schoolteacher Patricia Anne is inclined to disagree -- especially when they find a strangled and stabbed dead body dangling in the pub's wishing well. The sheriff has some questions for Mouse and her sister Sister, who were the last people, besides the murderer, of course, to see the ill-fated victim alive. And they had better come up with some answers soon -- because a killer with unfinished business has begun sending them some mighty threatening messages...</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.A refreshingly different heroine, retired Alabama schoolteacher Patricia Anne Hollowell, is drawn into a murder investigation after her colorful sister, Mary Alice, buys a country-western club. When the previous owner is found gruesomely murdered, the suspects include the club's cook, one of Patricia Anne's former prize students. Sprightly dialogue and a humorous eye for detail get this mystery off to a promising start. However, once the offbeat characters are introduced, they and their relationships fail to change or deepen. The dialogue becomes repetitive, and the telling domestic observations lapse into trivia. Clues accumulate more through coincidence than through investigation, with the conclusion weighed down by a welter of implausible connections and old secrets. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Light</h2><p><b>Lucille Clifton</b> was born in Depew, New York in 1936, and educated at the State University of New York at Fredonia and at Howard University.

These poems contain all the simplicity and grace readers have come to expect from her work. The first few pages set the title in a larger perspective at the same time that they announce the book's premise: "woman, i am / lucille, which stands for light." This is a feminist version of Roots , charged with outrage at the sins done to women of previous generations. There are the typical heroes and anti-heroes: Atlas, Sisyphus, Leda, biblical women--but even these tired figures are given a new, often comic, twist: Naomi, for example, doesn't want Ruth's devotion, just to be left alone to "grieve in peace"; several poems are addressed to Clark Kent as the speaker comes to terms with the realization that he doesn't have the power to save her after all. And what do today's women have instead of superheroes? Jesse Helms; fathers who "burned us all." Though it is based more or less in traditional Christianity, the poetry also is concerned with how spirituality can be personal. Low key and poignant, poem after poem takes the form of a conversation, whether woman to her dead parents, Lucifer to God, or poet to reader. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Virtuous Leadership</h2><p>Drawing on the lives of some of the greatest political, intellectual and religious leaders of modern times, and the author&#39;s personal experience, Virtuous Leadership demonstrates that leadership and virtue are not only compatible, they are actually synonymous. Virtuous Leadership defines each of the classical human virtues most essential to leadership - magnanimity, humility, prudence, courage, self-control and justice. It demonstrates how these virtues promote personal transformation and the attainment of self-fulfillment. It also considers the Christian supernatural virtues of faith, hope and charity without which no study of leadership can be complete. The book&#39;s final section, Towards Victory, offers a methodology for the achievement of interior growth tailored to the needs of busy, professional people intent on imbuing their lives with a transcendent purpose. Thus, the aim of Virtuous Leadership is ultimately practical. It is meant to be your guidebook in the quest for excellence.</p><p></p><h2>Forty Stories (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>If any writer can be said to have invented the modern short story, it is Anton Chekhov. It is not just that Chekhov democratized this art form; more than that, he changed the thrust of short fiction from relating to revealing. And what marvelous and unbearable things are revealed in these Forty Stories. The abashed happiness of a woman in the presence of the husband who abandoned her years before. The obsequious terror of the official who accidentally sneezes on a general. The poignant astonishment of an aging Don Juan overtaken by love. Spanning the entirety of Chekhov's career and including such masterpieces as "Surgery," "The Huntsman," "Anyuta," "Sleepyhead," "The Lady With the Pet Dog," and "The Bishop," this collection manages to be amusing, dazzling, and supremely moving&#x2014;often within a single page.</p><p>This is a collection of 40 short stories from author Anton Chekhov, and ranging from the abashed happiness of a woman in the presence of the husband who abandoned her years before, to the poignant astonishment of an aging Don Juan overtaken by love, and many more.<b>Anton Pavlovich Chekhov</b> (1860&#x2013;1904) was a Russian playwright and short story writer who is considered to be among the greatest writers of short fiction in history. His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theater. Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career: "Medicine is my lawful wife," he once said, "and literature is my mistress."Chekhov renounced the theatre after the disastrous reception of <i>The Seagull</i> in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Constantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's&nbsp;<i>Uncle Vanya</i>&nbsp;and premiered his last two plays,&nbsp;<i>Three Sisters</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text."Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.&nbsp;Anton Chekhov was the author of hundreds of short stories and several plays and is regarded by many as both the greatest Russian storyteller and the father of modern drama.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Robert Payne</b>&nbsp;(1911&#x2013;1983) was a writer known for his novels, poems, and articles. Payne specialized in biography and history. After working and studying abroad Asia, he moved to the United States, where he became a professor of English literature. He spent the rest of his life in New York. A prolific biographic, Payne wrote some of the essential texts on Hitler, Stalin, Marx, Mao Zedong, Lenin, and Gandhi.</p><h2>Home Of Our Hearts (Christy &amp; Todd: The Married Years V2)</h2><p>Christy and Todd are looking forward to being part of two important weddings.

The four perspectives of the scorecard--financial measures, customer knowledge, internal business processes, and learning and growth--offer a balance between short-term and long-term objectives, between outcomes desired and performance drivers of those outcomes, and between hard objective measures and softer, more subjective measures. In the first part, Kaplan and Norton provide the theoretical foundations for the Balanced Scorecard; in the second part, they describe the steps organizations must take to build their own Scorecards; and, finally, they discuss how the Balanced Scorecard can be used as a driver of change.<br></p><p>Here is the book - by the recognized architects of the Balanced Scorecard - that shows how managers can use this revolutionary tool to mobilize their people to fulfill the company&#39;s mission. More than just a measurement system, the Balanced Scorecard is a management system that can channel the energies, abilities, and specific knowledge held by people throughout the organization toward achieving long-term strategic goals. Kaplan and Norton demonstrate how senior executives in industries such as banking, oil, insurance, and retailing are using the Balanced Scorecard both to guide current performance and to target future performance. They show how to use measures in four categories - financial performance, customer knowledge, internal business processes, and learning and growth - to align individual, organizational, and cross-departmental initiatives and to identify entirely new processes for meeting customer and shareholder objectives. The authors also reveal how to use the Balanced Scorecard as a robust learning system for testing, gaining feedback on, and updating the organization&#39;s strategy. Finally, they walk through the steps that managers in any company can use to build their own Balanced Scorecard. The Balanced Scorecard provides the management system for companies to invest in the long term - in customers, in employees, in new product development, and in systems - rather than managing the bottom line to pump up short-term earnings. It will change the way you measure and manage your business.Robert S. Kaplan is the Arthur Lowes Dickinson Professor of Accounting at the Harvard Business School. David P. Norton is the president of Renaissance Solutions, Inc. They are the authors of three seminal Harvard Business Review articles on the Balanced Scorecard.</p><h2>The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles of modern times, a dangerous tinderbox always poised to set the Middle East aflame--and to draw the United States into the fire. In this accessible and stimulating Very Short Introduction, Martin Bunton illuminates the history of the problem, reducing it to its very essence. Adopting a fresh and original approach, Bunton explores the Palestinian-Israeli dispute in twenty-year segments, to highlight the historical complexity of the conflict throughout successive decades. Each chapter starts with an examination of the relationships among people and events that marked particular years as historical stepping stones in the evolution of the conflict, including the 1897 Basle Congress, the 1917 Balfour Declaration and British occupation of Palestine, and the 1947 UN Partition Plan and the war for Palestine. <br><br>Providing a clear and fair exploration of the main issues, Bunton explores not only the historical basis of the conflict, but also looks at how and why partition has been so difficult and how efforts to restore peace continue today.<br><br>About the Series: <br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

With all the stark simplicity of a fractured fairy tale, the trilogy tells the story of twin brothers, Claus and Lucas, locked in an agonizing bond that becomes a gripping allegory of the forces that have divided &#34;brothers&#34; in much of Europe since World War II. Kristof&#39;s postmodern saga begins with The Notebook, in which the brothers are children, lost in a country torn apart by conflict, who must learn every trick of evil and cruelty merely to survive. In The Proof, Lucas is challenging to prove his own identity and the existence of his missing brother, a defector to the &#34;other side.&#34; The Third Lie, which closes the trilogy, is a biting parable of Eastern and Western Europe today and a deep exploration into the nature of identity, storytelling, and the truths and untruths that lie at the heart of them all. &#34;Stark and haunting.&#34; - The San Francisco Chronicle; &#34;A vision of considerable depth and complexity, a powerful portrait of the nobility and perversity of the human heart.&#34; - The Christian Science Monitor.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>A Short Course in Reading French</h2><p>This textbook teaches the basics of French grammar, reinforcing its lessons with exercises and key practice translations.

What keeps ignorance alive, or allows it to be used as a political instrument? Agnotology&#x2015;the study of ignorance&#x2015;provides a new theoretical perspective to broaden traditional questions about "how we know" to ask: Why don't we know what we don't know? The essays assembled in <i>Agnotology</i> show that ignorance is often more than just an absence of knowledge; it can also be the outcome of cultural and political struggles. Ignorance has a history and a political geography, but there are also things people don't want you to know ("Doubt is our product" is the tobacco industry slogan). Individual chapters treat examples from the realms of global climate change, military secrecy, female orgasm, environmental denialism, Native American paleontology, theoretical archaeology, racial ignorance, and more. The goal of this volume is to better understand how and why various forms of knowing do not come to be, or have disappeared, or have become invisible.</p><p>Robert N. Proctor is Professor of the History of Science at Stanford University and the author of <i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i> (1999) and <i>Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know</i> (1995). Londa Schiebinger is the John L. Hinds Professor of History of Science and the Barbara D. Finberg Director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University. Her recent books include <i>Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World</i> (2004) and <i>Gendered Innovations in Science and Engineering</i> (forthcoming from Stanford)."In the past years there have been few new fields of research as timely as agnotology. Many a time one is puzzled by the widespread ignorance of some of the greatest challenges mankind faces today, be it global warming, the way to the Iraq war, or the global tobacco epidemic. Agnotology might very well be the tool to delve into the great black holes of modern knowledge and also find a way out." (Andrian Kreye)<br><br>"Anyone who thinks ignorance is nobodys business has a lot to learn from these provocative essays. The distinguished authors offer compelling evidence that what we do not know is every bit as much a product of human choice and ingenuity as what we choose to know. <i>Agnotology</i> rescues ignorance from the no-mans-land of unexamined social phenomena. It makes us ask what is at stake when we dont know things that are plainly before our eyes.

This is even truer in Malka Marom's new book about the musician's life and creative process.

Here he presents the culmination of his ideas and urges us to move from being a disrupting force on the Earth to a benign presence. This transition is the Great Work -- the most necessary and most ennobling work we will ever undertake. Berry&#39;s message is not one of doom but of hope. He reminds society of its function, particularly the universities and other educational institutions whose role is to guide students into an appreciation rather than an exploitation of the world around them. Berry is the leading spokesperson for the Earth, and his profound ecological insight illuminates the path we need to take in the realms of ethics, politics, economics, and education if both we and the planet are to survive.</p><p>The future can exist only if humans understand how to commune with the natural world rather than exploit it, explains author and renowned ecologist Thomas Berry (<i>The Dream of the Earth</i>, <i>The Universe Story</i>). "Already the planet is so damaged and the future is so challenged by its rising human population that the terms of survival will be severe beyond anything we have known in the past."<p> This may make him sound like a scolding, doomsday prophet, but Berry is an optimistic soul, hopeful that humans will rise to the challenge of cherishing the natural world in the third millennium. "Our future destiny rests even more decisively on our capacity for intimacy in our human-Earth relations." Berry predicts. From this premise, Berry reveals why we need to adore our blessed planet, while also examining why we are culturally driven toward exploiting nature. Because Berry has a science background as well as a spiritual orientation (he is the founder of the History of Religions Program at Fordham University), he brings a balanced and fresh voice to social ecology. Even though he writes for the masses, Berry is by no means a lightweight--chapters include "Ecological Geography," "The Extractive Economy," "The Corporation Story," and "Reinventing the Human." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>As most of you know, Thomas Berry is the grandfather of the Deep Ecology movement and is known variously as a geologian or cosmologist. It is certainly an honor to publish this extraordinary document which is at the same time the summation of his life's work and a blueprint for our own. Berry's language and thinking are on a grand scale and it is only by sharing in his vision that we will be able to take advantage of this moment of grace and find a way to ensure the future of the planet.<br><br>-- Toinette Lippe, editorial director of Bell Tower</p><h2>An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p><p>"Uncommonly good...the most satisfying discussion to be found." &#x2014; <i>Scientific American.<br></i>Behind the familiar surfaces of the telephone, radio, and television lies a sophisticated and intriguing body of knowledge known as information theory. This is the theory that has permitted the rapid development of all sorts of communication, from color television to the clear transmission of photographs from the vicinity of Jupiter. Even more revolutionary progress is expected in the future.<br>To give a solid introduction to this burgeoning field, J. R. Pierce has revised his well-received 1961 study of information theory for a second edition. Beginning with the origins of the field, Dr. Pierce follows the brilliant formulations of Claude Shannon and describes such aspects of the subject as encoding and binary digits, entropy, language and meaning, efficient encoding, and the noisy channel. He then goes beyond the strict confines of the topic to explore the ways in which information theory relates to physics, cybernetics, psychology, and art. Mathematical formulas are introduced at the appropriate points for the benefit of serious students. A glossary of terms and an appendix on mathematical notation are proved to help the less mathematically sophisticated.<br>J. R. Pierce worked for many years at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he became Director of Research in Communications Principles. His <i>Introduction to Information Theory</i> continues to be the most impressive nontechnical account available and a fascinating introduction to the subject for lay readers.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Thomas Sankara Speaks: The Burkina Faso Revolution 1983 87</h2><p>Under Sankara's leadership, the revolutionary government of Burkina Faso in West Africa set an electrifying example.

Thinking it might be his final work, he summoned all his poetic genius to create a luminous work that defies categorization. In stunning language, Darwish&#x2019;s self-elegy inhabits a rare space where opposites bleed and blend into each other. Prose and poetry, life and death, home and exile are all sung by the poet and his other. On the threshold of im/mortality, the poet looks back at his own existence, intertwined with that of his people. Through these lyrical meditations on love, longing, Palestine, history, friendship, family, and the ongoing conversation between life and death, the poet bids himself and his readers a poignant farewell.</p><p>Mahmoud Darwish (1941&#x2013;2008) was born in the village of al-Birwa, in the Galilee, Palestine. He became a refugee at age seven. He worked as a journalist and editor in Haifa and left to study in Moscow in 1970. His exilic journey took him to Cairo, Beirut, Tunis, Paris, Amman, and Ramallah, where he settled in 1995. He is one of the most celebrated and revered poets in the Arab world. He published more than thirty books, and his poetry has been translated into thirty-five languages. Darwish was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by France in 1993, was awarded the Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize in 2001, the Prince Claus Awardin 2004, and the Cairo Prize for Arabic Poetry in 2007.<br><br> Sinan Antoon is an Iraqi poet, novelist, and translator.

His office is a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, and fine leather chairs. He has no firm, no partners, and only one employee: his heavily armed driver, who also so happens to be his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddie. Sebastian drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun. He defends people other lawyers won&#x2019;t go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house. Why these clients?

I don&#x2019;t pay to be seen on television, though I am often there. My name is not listed in any phone book. I do not maintain a traditional office. I carry a gun, legally, because my name and face tend to attract attention from the type of people who also carry guns and don&#x2019;t mind using them. I live alone, usually sleep alone, and do not possess the patience and understanding necessary to maintain friendships. The law is my life, always consuming and occasionally fulfilling. I wouldn&#x2019;t call it a &#x201c;jealous mistress&#x201d; as some forgotten person once so famously did. It&#x2019;s more like an overbearing wife who controls the checkbook. There&#x2019;s no way out.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These nights I find myself sleeping in cheap motel rooms that change each week. I&#x2019;m not trying to save money; rather, I&#x2019;m just trying to stay alive. There are plenty of people who&#x2019;d like to kill me right now, &nbsp;and a few of them have been quite vocal. They don&#x2019;t tell you in law school that one day you may find yourself defending a person charged with a crime so heinous that otherwise peaceful citizens feel driven to take up arms and threaten to kill the accused, his lawyer, and even the judge.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I&#x2019;ve been threatened before. It&#x2019;s part of being a rogue lawyer, a subspecialty of the profession that I more or less fell into ten years ago. When I finished law school, jobs were scarce. I reluctantly took a part-time position in the City&#x2019;s public defender&#x2019;s office. From there I landed in a small, unprofitable firm that handled only criminal defense. After a few years, that firm blew up and I was on my own, out on the street with plenty of others, scrambling to make a buck. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One case put me on the map. I can&#x2019;t say it made me famous because, seriously, how can you say a lawyer is famous in a city of a million people? Plenty of local hacks think they&#x2019;re famous. They smile from billboards as they beg for your bankruptcy and swagger in television ads as they seem deeply concerned about your personal injuries, but they&#x2019;re forced to pay for their own publicity. Not me.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cheap motels change each week. I&#x2019;m in the middle of a trial in a dismal, backwater, redneck town called Milo, two hours from where I live in the City. I am defending a brain-damaged eighteen-year-old dropout who&#x2019;s &nbsp;charged with killing two little girls in one of the most evil crimes I&#x2019;ve ever seen, and I&#x2019;ve seen plenty. My clients are almost always guilty, so I don&#x2019;t waste a lot of time wringing my hands about whether they get what they deserve. In this case, though, Gardy is not guilty, not that it matters. It does not. What&#x2019;s important in Milo these days is that Gardy gets convicted and sentenced to death and executed as soon as possible so that the town can feel better about itself and move on. Move on to where, exactly? Hell if I know, nor do I care. This place has been moving backward for fifty years, and one lousy verdict will not change its course. I&#x2019;ve read and heard it said that Milo needs &#x201c;closure,&#x201d; whatever that means. You&#x2019;d have to be an idiot to believe this town will somehow grow and prosper and become more tolerant as soon as Gardy gets the needle.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My job is layered and complicated, and at the same time it&#x2019;s quite simple. I&#x2019;m being paid by the State to provide a first-class defense to a defendant charged with capital murder, and this requires me to fight and claw and raise hell in a courtroom where&nbsp;no one is listening. Gardy was essentially convicted the day he was arrested, and his trial is only a formality. The dumb and desperate cops trumped up the charges and fabricated the evidence. The prosecutor knows this but has no spine and is up for reelection next year. The judge is asleep. The jurors are basically nice, simple people, wide-eyed at the process and ever so anxious to believe the lies their proud authorities are producing on the witness stand. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Milo has its share of cheap motels but I can&#x2019;t stay there. I would be lynched or flayed or burned at the stake, or if I&#x2019;m lucky a sniper would hit me between the eyes and it would be over in a flash. The state police are providing protection during the trial, but I get the clear impression these guys are just not into it. They view me the same way most people do. I&#x2019;m a long-haired roguish zealot sick enough to fight for the rights of child killers and the like.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My current motel is a Hampton Inn located twenty-five minutes from Milo. It costs $60 a night and the State will reimburse me. Next door is Partner, a hulking, heavily armed guy who wears black suits and takes me everywhere. Partner is my driver, bodyguard, confidant, paralegal, caddie, and only friend. I earned his loyalty when a jury found him not guilty of killing an undercover narcotics officer. We walked out of the courtroom arm in arm and have been inseparable ever since. On at least two occasions, off-duty cops have tried to kill him. On one occasion, they came after me.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&#x2019;re still standing. Or perhaps I should say we&#x2019;re still ducking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>2.</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At 8:00 a.m. Partner knocks on my door. It&#x2019;s time to go. We say our good mornings and climb into my vehicle, which is a large black Ford cargo van, heavily customized for my needs. Since it doubles &nbsp;as an office, &nbsp;the rear seats have been rearranged around&nbsp;a small table that folds into a wall. There is a sofa where I often spend the night. All windows are shaded and bulletproof. It has a television, stereo system, Internet, refrigerator, bar, a couple of guns, and a change of clothes. I sit in the front with Partner and we unwrap fast-food sausage biscuits as we leave the parking lot. An unmarked state police car moves in front of us for the escort to Milo. There is another one behind us. The last death threat was two days ago and came by e-mail. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Partner does not speak unless spoken to. I didn&#x2019;t make this rule&nbsp;but I adore it. He is not the least bit bothered by long gaps in the conversation, nor am I. After years of saying next to nothing, we have learned to communicate with nods and winks and silence. Halfway to Milo I open a file and start taking notes.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The double murder was so gruesome no local lawyer would&nbsp;touch it. Then Gardy was arrested, and one look at Gardy and you know he&#x2019;s guilty. Long hair dyed jet-black, an astonishing collection of piercings above the neck and tattoos below, matching steel earrings, cold pale eyes, and a smirk that says, &#x201c;Okay, I did it, now what?&#x201d; In its very first story, the Milo newspaper described him as &#x201c;a member of a satanic cult who has a record of molesting children.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How&#x2019;s that for honest and unbiased reporting? He was never a member of a satanic cult and the child molestation thing is not what it seems. &nbsp;But from that moment Gardy was guilty, and I still marvel at the fact that we&#x2019;ve made it this far. They wanted to string him up months ago.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Needless to say, every lawyer in Milo locked his door and unplugged her phone. There is no public defender system in the town&#x2014;it&#x2019;s too small&#x2014;and the indigent cases are doled out by the judge. There &nbsp;is &nbsp;an unwritten &nbsp;rule that the &nbsp;younger lawyers in town take these low-paying cases because (1) someone has to and&nbsp;(2) the older lawyers did so when they were younger. But no one would agree to defend Gardy, and, to be honest, I can&#x2019;t really blame them. It&#x2019;s their town and their lives, and to rub shoulders with such a twisted murderer could do real damage to a career. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a society, we adhere to the belief in a fair trial for a person accused of a serious crime, but some of us struggle when it comes to the business of providing a competent lawyer to guarantee said fair trial. Lawyers like me live with the question &#x201c;But how do you represent such scum? &#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I offer a quick &#x201c;Someone has to&#x201d; as I walk away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do we really want fair trials? No, we do not. We want justice, and quickly. And justice is whatever we deem it to be on a case-by-case basis.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s just as well that we don&#x2019;t believe in fair trials because we&nbsp;damned sure don&#x2019;t have them. The presumption of innocence is now the presumption of guilt. The burden of proof is a travesty because the proof is often lies. Guilt beyond a reasonable doubt means if he probably did it, then let&#x2019;s get him off the streets.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At any rate, the lawyers ran for the hills and Gardy had no one. It&#x2019;s a commentary, sad or otherwise, on my reputation that I soon got the phone call. In this end of the state, it is now well known in legal circles that if you can&#x2019;t find anybody else, call Sebastian Rudd. He&#x2019;ll defend anybody!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Gardy was arrested, a mob showed up outside the jail and screamed for justice. When the police perp-walked him to a van for the ride to the courthouse, the mob cursed him and threw tomatoes and rocks. This was thoroughly reported by the local newspaper and even made the City&#x2019;s evening news (there is no network station based in Milo, only a low-end cable outfit). I howled for a change of venue, pleaded with the judge to move the trial at least a hundred miles away so we could hopefully find some&nbsp;jurors who hadn&#x2019;t thrown stuff at the kid, or at the least cursed him over dinner. But we were denied. All of my pretrial motions were denied. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, the town wants justice. The town wants closure.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no mob to greet me and my van as we pull in to a short driveway behind the courthouse, but some of the usual actors are here. They huddle behind a police barricade not far away and hold their sad signs that say such clever things as &#x201c;Hang the Baby Killer,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Satan Is Waiting,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Crud Rudd out of Milo!&#x201d; There are about a dozen of these pathetic souls, just waiting to jeer at me and, more important, to show their hatred to Gardy, who will arrive at the same place in about five minutes. During the early days of the trial, this little crowd attracted cameras and a few of these people made it into the newspapers, along with their signs. This, of course, encouraged them and they&#x2019;ve been here every morning since. Fat Susie holds the &#x201c;Crud Rudd&#x201d; sign and looks like she wants to shoot me. Bullet Bob claims to be a relative of one of the dead girls and was quoted as saying something to the effect that a trial was a waste of time.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was right about that, I&#x2019;m afraid.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the van stops, Partner hurries around to my door, where he&#x2019;s met by three young deputies about his size. I step out and am properly shielded, then I&#x2019;m whisked into the rear door of the courthouse as Bullet Bob calls me a whore. Another safe entry. I&#x2019;m not aware of any case in modern times in which a criminal defense attorney was gunned down while entering a courthouse in the middle of a trial. Nevertheless, I have resigned myself to the likelihood that I could well be the first.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We climb a narrow rear staircase that&#x2019;s off-limits to everyone else, and I&#x2019;m led to a small windowless room where they once held prisoners waiting to see the judge. A few minutes later, Gardy arrives in one piece. Partner steps outside and closes the door.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How ya doing?&#x201d; I ask when we are alone.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He smiles and rubs his wrists, unshackled for a few hours. &#x201c;Okay, I guess. Didn&#x2019;t sleep much.&#x201d; He &nbsp;didn&#x2019;t shower either because he&#x2019;s afraid to shower. He tries it occasionally but they won&#x2019;t turn on the hot water. So Gardy reeks of stale sweat and dirty sheets, and I&#x2019;m thankful he&#x2019;s far enough away from the jury. The black dye is slowly leaving his hair and each day it gets lighter, and his skin gets paler. He&#x2019;s changing colors in front of the jury, another clear sign of his animalistic capabilities and satanic bent.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s gonna happen today?&#x201d; he asks, with an almost childlike curiosity. He has an IQ of 70, just barely enough to be prosecuted and put to death.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;More of the same, Gardy, I&#x2019;m afraid. Just more of the same.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you make them stop lying? &#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, I cannot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The State has no physical evidence linking Gardy to the murders. Zero. So, instead of evaluating its lack of evidence and reconsidering its case, the State is doing what it often does. It&#x2019;s plowing ahead with lies and fabricated testimony.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gardy has spent two weeks in the courtroom, listening to the lies, closing his eyes while slowly shaking his head. He&#x2019;s able to shake his head for hours at a time, and the jurors must think he&#x2019;s crazy. I&#x2019;ve told him to stop, to sit up, to take a pen and scribble something on a legal pad as if he has a brain and wants to fight back, to win. But he simply cannot do this and I cannot argue with my client in the courtroom. &nbsp;I&#x2019;ve also told him to cover his arms and neck to hide the tattoos, but he&#x2019;s proud of them. I&#x2019;ve told him to lose the piercings, but he insists on being who he is. The bright folks who run the Milo jail forbid piercings of all types, unless, of course, you&#x2019;re Gardy and you&#x2019;re headed back to the courtroom. In that case, stick&nbsp;&#x2019;em all over your face. Look as sick and creepy and satanic as possible, Gardy, so that your peers will have no trouble with your guilt. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On a nail is a hanger with the same white shirt and khaki pants he&#x2019;s worn every day. I paid for this cheap ensemble. He slowly unzips the orange jail jumpsuit and steps out of it. He does not wear underwear, something I noticed the first day of the trial and have tried to ignore since. He slowly gets dressed. &#x201c;So much lying,&#x201d; he says.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he&#x2019;s right. The State has called nineteen witnesses so far and not a single &nbsp;one resisted the temptation to embellish a bit, or to lie outright. The pathologist who did the autopsies at the state crime lab told the jury the two little victims had drowned, but he also added that &#x201c;blunt force trauma&#x201d; to their heads was a contributing factor. It&#x2019;s a better story for the prosecution if the jury believes the girls were raped and beaten senseless before being tossed into the pond. There&#x2019;s no physical proof they were in any way sexually molested, but that hasn&#x2019;t stopped the prosecution from making this a part of its case. I haggled with the pathologist for three hours, but it&#x2019;s tough arguing with an expert, even an incompetent one.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the State has no evidence, it is forced to manufacture some. The most outrageous testimony came from a jailhouse snitch they call Smut, an appropriate nickname. Smut is an accomplished courtroom liar who testifies all the time and will say whatever the prosecutors want him to say. In Gardy&#x2019;s case, Smut was back in jail on a drug charge and looking at ten years in prison. The cops needed som...</p><h2>Thin Air (Spenser)</h2><p>Her name is Lisa St. Claire. Her husband&#39;s a cop. Her whereabouts are unknown. Spenser thought he could help a friend find his missing wife. Until he learned the nasty truth about Lisa St. Claire. For starters, it&#39;s not her real name...</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Spenser Lite: less death, more wit. Though at times the violence in past Spenser novels has strained credulity, it often had a cathartic effect for both reader and hero. But lately author Parker includes less gunplay and fisticuffs. Symbolic of the change is the fact that, in this twenty-third Spenser adventure, the detective's friend and ultradeadly ally, Hawk, is off in Burma, leaving Spenser on his own when longtime pal Frank Belson of Boston Homicide needs help. Belson's beautiful young bride, Lisa St. Claire, has disappeared. When Belson is wounded in an ambush that may be related to Lisa's disappearance, Spenser undertakes the search. The trail initially leads him to L.A., where a friendly mobster--who may have an interest in the resolution of the case--lends Spenser the use of Chollo, a sort of Hispanic Hawk. Eventually, Spenser concludes that Lisa is the captive of Luis DeLeon, the second-ranking bad guy in the aging New England mill town of Proctor, where he--and presumably Lisa--are ensconced in a well-armed fortress. The ending is predictable, if less violent than one might except. Lisa is by no means the first damsel in distress to be rescued by Spenser, and frankly, the plot has become a drag. The captors are always deranged, confusing love with power, and the victims are in jeopardy as a result of poor taste in lovers. Silly women, brave Spenser. Still, longtime fans will stand in line for this one, and in their defense, even flawed Spenser is good reading. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Through the Year With Thomas Merton: Daily Meditations from His Writings</h2><p><b>A meditation a day from Thomas Merton<br> <br> </b>This convenient day book is a compendium of inspiring passages from the writings of one of this century's spiritual giants. It offers daily challenges for thoughtful meditation intended to stimulate, provoke, and lead to grace. Here are some enduring thoughts found in these pages:<br> <br> "We cannot be happy if we expect o live all the time at the highest peak of intensity. Happiness is not a matter of intensity, but of balance and order and rhythm and harmony."<br> <br> "Every moment and every event of every man's life on earth plants something in his soul."<br> <br> "Nothing is more suspicious, in a man who seems holy, than an impatient desire to reform other men. Pay as little attention as you can to the faults of other people and none at all to their natural defects and eccentricities."<br> <br> "The wise heart lives in Christ."<br> <br> "Wisdom manifests itself, and yet is hidden. The more it hides, the more it is manifest; and the more it is manifest, the more it is hidden. For God is known where he is apprehended as unknown, and he is heard when we realize that we do not know the sound of his voice."<br> <br> "God utters me like a word containing a partial thought of himself."<br> <br> "Our full spiritual life is life in wisdom, life in Christ. The darkness of faith bears fruit in the light of wisdom."<br> <br> "Love cannot come of emptiness. It is full of reality."</p><p><b>Thomas P.

In this family history, Fate and the gods decree that each generation will repeat the crimes and endure the suffering of their forebears. When Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, their son Orestes must avenge his father's death. Only Orestes' appeal to the goddess Athena saves him from his mother's Furies, breaking the bloody chain; together gods and humans inaugurate a way of just conduct that will ensure stable families and a strong community. <br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

But this is most certainly not fiction. It is the astonishing narrative of one of the most far-reaching and elaborate cons in the history of art forgery. Stretching from London to Paris to New York, investigative reporters Laney Salisbury and Aly Sujo recount the tale of infamous con man and unforgettable villain John Drewe and his accomplice, the affable artist John Myatt. Together they exploited the archives of British art institutions to irrevocably legitimize the hundreds of pieces they forged, many of which are still considered genuine and hang in prominent museums and private collections today.</p><p><b>Laney Salisbury</b>, a graduate of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has reported from Africa, the Middle East, and New York. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br><br><b>Aly Sujo</b> was an investigative reporter, part of a husband-and-wife team with Laney Salisbury. He covered arts and entertainment for Reuters, the Associated Press, and the New York <i>Daily News</i>. He died in 2008.The grand moment in the reception finally arrived. Two white-gloved Tate conservators entered the room with a pair of paintings, each about five feet tall. There was a moment of respectful silence. Myatt was stunned.<p>&#x201c;Ahh, the Bissi�res, how lovely,&#x201d;someone in the room whispered.</p><p>Myatt cringed as the group praised the paintings and Drewe&#x2019;s taste and generosity. The two works were carried around the room, and long before they reached Myatt, he recognized the faint but acrid smell of the varnish he had sprayed on them when he&#x2019;d finished them a few weeks earlier.</p><p>Myatt gripped his chair. If they so much as touched the canvas with a fine brush, the paint would give way and the game would be up. A little further investigative work would reveal that the pieces&#x2014;purportedly painted more than forty years earlier&#x2014;had been made with modern, ordinary house paint.</p><p>The reception over, the Tate brass escorted Drewe and Myatt down the winding staircase. Stopping at a landing, one of the officials pointed at a place on the wall and said: &#x201c;This is where we&#x2019;ll hang these two wonderful pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>Placing a work at the Tate was a remarkable achievement for any artist&#x2014;forger or not&#x2014;but Myatt could see only one possible end to what had transpired. He had survived many low points in his past, but none as low as this. Surely he would end up in prison.</p><p>Once in the taxi, Myatt, usually deferential toward Drewe, exploded. &#x201c;You have to get them back.&#x201d;</p><p>Drewe argued that if they were to ask for the paintings back, it would involve a terrible loss of credibility, putting at risk all the time he had put into cultivating the confidence of the Tate&#x2019;s archivists. But he also saw that as long as the twoc arelessly done forgeries remained in the hands of museum curators, Myatt would remain paralyzed by the fear that they would be his undoing.</p><p>The following day Drewe was back at the Tate to withdraw the Bissi�res. There was a problem with their provenance, questions having to do with the previous owners. In place of the two works, he was prepared to offer a sizable cash donation to the Tate&#x2019;s archives.</p><p>Within days the Tate received a check for twenty thousand pounds (forty thousand dollars) to help catalog the archives, along with a promise of half a million more to come. With this donation, Drewe established himself as a respected donor for whom the doors of the heavily guarded archival department would stand open. The historical records of one of the world&#x2019;s great museums, and its cherished credibility, were about to become irreparably compromised.</p></p><h2>How Not to Become a Crotchety Old Man</h2><p>A crotchety old man decided to wash his sweatshirt.

Visit her online at LucindaRiley.com.The Girl on the Cliff 1<br><br>Dunworley Bay, West Cork, Ireland<p></p> <br>The small figure was standing perilously close to the edge of the cliff. Her luxuriant, long red hair had been caught by the strong breeze and was flying out behind her. A thin white cotton dress reached to her ankles and exposed her small, bare feet. Her arms were held taut, palms facing out toward the foaming mass of gray sea beneath her, her pale face looking upward, as if she were offering herself as a sacrifice to the elements.<br> <br>Grania Ryan stood watching her, hypnotized by the wraithlike vision. Her senses were too jumbled to tell her whether what she was seeing before her was real or imagined. She closed her eyes for a split second, then reopened them, and saw that the figure was still there. With the appropriate messages sent to her brain, she took a couple of tentative steps forward.<br> <br>As she drew nearer, Grania realized the figure was no more than a child; that the white cotton she was wearing was a nightdress. Grania could see the black storm clouds hovering out over the sea and the first saltwater droplets of impending rain stung her cheeks. The frailty of the small human against the wildness of her surroundings made her steps toward the child more urgent in pace.<br> <br>The wind was whipping around her ears now and had started to voice its rage. Grania stopped ten yards from the girl, who was still unmoving. She saw the tiny blue toes holding her stoically to the rock, as the rising wind whipped and swayed her thin body like a willow sapling. She moved closer to the girl, stopping just behind her, uncertain of what to do next. Grania&#x2019;s instinct was to run forward and grab her, but if the girl was startled and turned around, one missed footfall could result in unthinkable tragedy, taking the child to certain death on the foam-covered rocks a hundred feet below.<br> <br>Grania stood, panic gripping her as she desperately tried to think of the best way to remove her from danger. But before she could reach a decision, the girl slowly turned around and stared at her with unseeing eyes.<br> <br>Instinctively Grania held out her arms. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t hurt you, I promise. Walk toward me and you&#x2019;ll be safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still the girl stared at her, not moving from her spot on the edge of the cliff.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can take you home if you tell me where you live. You&#x2019;ll catch your death out here. Please, let me help you,&#x201d; Grania begged.<br> <br>She took another step toward the child, and then, as if the girl had woken up from a dream, a look of fear crossed her face. Instantly, she turned to her right and began to run away from Grania along the cliff&#x2019;s edge, disappearing from view.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just about to be sending out the search party for you. That storm&#x2019;s blowing up well and good, so it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mam, I&#x2019;m thirty-one years old, and I&#x2019;ve lived in Manhattan for the past ten of those,&#x201d; replied Grania drily as she entered the kitchen and hung her wet jacket over the AGA stove. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to mind me. I&#x2019;m a big girl now, remember?&#x201d; She smiled as she walked toward her mother, who was setting the table for supper, and kissed her on the cheek. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s as may be, but I&#x2019;ve known stronger men by far blown off the cliff in a gale like this.&#x201d; Kathleen Ryan indicated the wildness of the wind outside the kitchen window, which was causing the flowerless wisteria bush to tap its twiggy brown deadness monotonously against the pane. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just made a brew.&#x201d; Kathleen wiped her hands on her apron and walked toward the AGA. &#x201c;Would you be wanting a cup?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be grand, Mam. Why don&#x2019;t you sit down and take the weight off your feet for a few minutes, and I&#x2019;ll pour it for both of us?&#x201d; Grania steered her mother to a kitchen chair, pulled it back from the table and sat her gently onto it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only five minutes, mind, the boys will be back at six for their tea.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Grania poured the strong liquid into two cups, she raised a silent eyebrow at her mother&#x2019;s domestic dedication to her husband and her son. Not that anything had changed in the past ten years since she&#x2019;d been away&#x2014;Kathleen had always pandered to her men, putting their needs and desires first. But the contrast of her mother&#x2019;s life to her own, where emancipation and equality of the sexes was standard, made Grania feel uncomfortable.<br> <br>And yet . . . for all her own freedom from what many modern women would consider outdated male tyranny, who was currently the most content out of mother and daughter? Grania sighed sadly as she added milk to her mother&#x2019;s tea. She knew the answer to that.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you go, Mam. Would you like a biscuit?&#x201d; Grania put the tin in front of Kathleen and opened it. As usual, it was full to the brim with custard creams, bourbons and shortbread rounds. Another relic of childhood, and one that would be looked on with the same horror as a small nuclear device by her figure-conscious New York contemporaries.<br> <br>Kathleen took two and said, &#x201c;Go on, have one yourself to keep me company. To be sure, you don&#x2019;t eat enough to keep a mouse alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania nibbled dutifully at a biscuit, thinking how, ever since she&#x2019;d arrived home ten days ago, she&#x2019;d felt stuffed to bursting with her mother&#x2019;s copious home cooking. Yet Grania would say that she had the healthiest appetite out of most of the women she knew in New York. And she actually used her oven as it was designed for, not as a convenient place to store plates.<br> <br>&#x201c;The walk cleared your head a little, did it?&#x201d; ventured Kathleen, making her way through her third biscuit. &#x201c;Whenever I have a problem in my mind to be sorted, I&#x2019;ll be off walking and come back knowing the answer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually . . .&#x201d; Grania took a sip of tea. &#x201c;I saw something strange, Mam, when I was out. A little girl, maybe eight or nine, standing in her nightie right up on the cliff&#x2019;s edge. She had beautiful long, curly red hair . . . it was as if she was sleepwalking, because she turned to look at me when I walked toward her and her eyes were&#x201d;&#x2014;she searched for the right description&#x2014;&#x201c;blank. Like she wasn&#x2019;t seeing me. Then she seemed to wake up and scampered off like a startled rabbit up the cliff path. Do you know who she might have been?&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania watched the color drain from Kathleen&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Are you OK, Mam?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kathleen visibly shook herself. She stared at her daughter. &#x201c;You say you saw her just a few minutes ago on your walk?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mary, Mother of God.&#x201d; Kathleen crossed herself. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s &#x2018;back,&#x2019; Mam?&#x201d; asked Grania, concerned by how shaken her mother seemed to be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why have they returned?&#x201d; Kathleen stared off through the window and into the night. &#x201c;Why would they be wanting to? I thought . . . I thought it was finally over, that they&#x2019;d be gone for good.&#x201d; Kathleen grabbed Grania&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Are you sure it was a little girl you saw, not a grown woman?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Positive, Mam. As I said, she was aged about eight or nine. I was concerned for her; she had nothing on her feet and looked frozen. To be honest, I wondered whether I was seeing a ghost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were of a fashion, Grania,&#x201d; Kathleen muttered. &#x201c;They can only have arrived back in the past few days. I was coming over the hill last Friday and I passed right by the house. It was gone ten in the evening and there were no lights shining from the windows. The old place was shut up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where would this be?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dunworley House.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The big deserted one that stands right on the top of the cliff up past us?&#x201d; asked Grania. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s been empty for years, hasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was empty for your childhood, yes, but&#x201d;&#x2014;Kathleen sighed&#x2014;&#x201c;they came back after you&#x2019;d moved to New York. And then, when the . . . accident happened, left. Nobody thought we&#x2019;d be seeing them around these parts again. And we were glad of it,&#x201d; she underlined. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a history there, between them and us, stretching back a long way. Now&#x201d;&#x2014;Kathleen slapped the table and made to stand up&#x2014;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s past is past, and I&#x2019;d advise you to stay away from them. They bring nothing but trouble to this family, so they do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania watched her mother as she walked over to the AGA, her face set hard as she lifted the heavy iron pot containing the evening meal out of one of the ovens. &#x201c;Surely if that child I saw has a mother, she would want to know about the danger her daughter was in today?&#x201d; she probed.<br> <br>&#x201c;She has no mother.&#x201d; Kathleen&#x2019;s wooden spoon stirred the stew rhythmically.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see . . . so who looks after the poor child?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be asking me about their domestic arrangements.&#x201d; Kathleen shrugged. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t care and I don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania frowned. Her mother&#x2019;s attitude was totally contrary to the way she would normally respond. Kathleen&#x2019;s big, maternal heart beat hard and loud for any poor thing in trouble. She was the first round to a member of the family, or friends, if there was a problem and support was needed. Especially when it came to children.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did her mother die?&#x201d;<br> <br>The wooden spoon ceased its circling of the pot and there was silence. Finally, Kathleen gave a heavy sigh and turned to face her daughter. &#x201c;Well now, I suppose if I&#x2019;m not telling you, you&#x2019;ll hear it soon enough from someone else. She took her own life, did Lily Lisle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying she committed suicide?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one and the same thing, Grania.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She threw herself off the cliff four years ago. Her body was found two days later, washed up on Inchydoney beach.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Grania&#x2019;s turn to stay silent. Finally, she ventured, &#x201c;Where did she jump from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the sound of things, probably where you set eyes on her daughter today. I&#x2019;d say Aurora was looking for her mammy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know her name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. &#x2019;Tis hardly a secret. The Lisle family used to own the whole of Dunworley, including this very house. They were the lords and masters round here a long time ago. They sold off their land in the sixties, but kept the house up on the cliff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen the name somewhere&#x2014;Lisle . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The local churchyard is filled with their graves. Including hers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve seen the little girl&#x2014;Aurora&#x2014;out on the cliffs before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why her daddy took her away. After she died, that little mite would walk along the cliffs calling for her. Half mad with grief she was.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania could see her mother&#x2019;s face had softened slightly. &#x201c;Poor little thing,&#x201d; she breathed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, it was a pitiful sight and she didn&#x2019;t deserve any of it, but there&#x2019;s a badness that runs through that family. You listen to what I say, Grania, and don&#x2019;t be getting yourself mixed up with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wonder why they&#x2019;re back?&#x201d; Grania murmured, almost to herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those Lisles are a law unto themselves. I don&#x2019;t know and I don&#x2019;t care. Now, will you be making yourself useful and helping me set the table for tea?&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Grania went upstairs to her bedroom at just past ten o&#x2019;clock, as she&#x2019;d done every night since she&#x2019;d arrived home. Downstairs, her mother was busy in the kitchen laying out the table for breakfast, her father was dozing in the chair in front of the TV and her brother, Shane, was at the village pub. Between the two men, they ran the 500-acre farm, the land mostly given over to dairy herd and sheep. At twenty-nine, the &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; as Shane was still affectionately called, seemed to have no intention of moving into his own home. Women came and went, but rarely across the threshold of his parents&#x2019; farmhouse. Kathleen raised her eyebrows over her son&#x2019;s still-unmarried status, but Grania knew her mother would be lost without him.<br> <br>She climbed between the sheets, listening to the rain battering the windowpanes, and hoped poor Aurora Lisle was tucked up inside, safe and warm. She turned the pages of a book, but found herself yawning and unable to concentrate. Perhaps it was the fresh air here that was making her sleepy; in New York she was rarely in bed before midnight.<br> <br>In contrast, Grania could scarcely remember a night as a child when her mother had not been at home in the evenings. And if she had to go away overnight on a mission of mercy to care for a sick relative, the preparation to make sure the family did not go hungry or the clothes unwashed was a military operation. As for her father, Grania doubted he had ever spent a night away from his bed in the past thirty-four years of his marriage. He was up at five thirty every morning of his life and off to the milking shed, coming home from the farm whenever dusk fell. Husband and wife knew exactly where the other was at all times. Their lives were as one; joint and inseparable.<br> <br>And the glue that bound them together was their children.<br> <br>When she and Matt had moved in together eight years ago, they&#x2019;d taken it for granted that one day there would be babies. Like any modern couple, until that suitable moment presented itself, they had taken their lives and careers by the throat and lived fast and hard while they could.<br> <br>And then, one morning, Grania had woken up and, as she did every morning, had thrown on her track pants and hoodie and jogged along the Hudson to Battery Park, stopping at the Winter Garden Atrium to enjoy a latte and bagel. And it was there that it had happened; she&#x2019;d been sipping her coffee and had glanced down into the pram parked by the next table. Inside was a tiny newborn baby, fast asleep. Grania was beset by a sudden, overwhelming urge to pick the baby up out of its pram, to cradle its soft, downy head protectively against her breast. When the mother had smiled nervously at her, then stood up and pushed the pram away from her unwanted attention, Grania had jogged back home, feeling breathless at the emotion that had been stirred in her.<br> <br>Expecting it to pass, she&#x2019;d spent the day in her studio, immersing herself in molding the malleable brown clay into her latest commission, but the feeling hadn&#x2019;t alleviated.<br> <br>At six, she&#x2019;d left her studio, showered and changed into something suitable for the opening of an art gallery she was attending that evening. She&#x2019;d poured herself a glass of wine and walked to the window that looked across to the twinkling lights of New Jersey on the other side of the Hudson River.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to have a baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grania had taken a hefty gulp of wine. And giggled at the absurdity of the words she&#x2019;d just spoken. So she&#x2019;d said them again, just to make sure.<br> <br>And they&#x2019;d still felt right. Not only right, but completely natural, as if the thought and the need had been with her all her life and all the reasons &#x201c;not to&#x201d; had simply evaporated and now seemed ridiculous.<br> <br>Grania had gone out to the gallery opening, made small talk with the usual mix of artists, collectors and envelope-openers that made up such events. Yet, in her mind, she was running through the practicalities of the life-changing decision she had made earlier. Would they have to move? No, probably not in the short term&#x2014;their TriBeCa loft was spacious and Matt&#x2019;s study/spare bedroom could easily be turned into a nursery. He rarely used it anyway, preferring to take his laptop into the sitting room and work there. They were up on the fourth floor, but the freight elevator was quite big enough to take a pram. Battery Park, with its well-equipped playground and fresh river air, was easily walkable. Grania worked from home in her studio, so even if a nanny had to be employed, she&#x2019;d only be a few seconds away from the baby if she was needed.<br> <br>Grania had climbed into the bi...</p><h2>Gods at War: Participant Journal</h2><p>Kyle Idleman, bestselling author of Not A Fan, shares the powerful next step in becoming a completely committed follower of Jesus: recognizing and letting God defeat the gods at war within us---the false gods battling to rule our hearts.

Sister Lucia was a prominent figure of the Portuguese Catholic world of the 20th Century. As the Shepherdess of Fatima who, together with Francisco and Jacinta saw our Lady in 1917, she is regarded as a child blessed and chosen to spread the message of peace and salvation of God throughout the world. As a Carmelite nun, she was known as as a privileged person dedicated to God and in service to His Church, one in whom people placed enormous confidence because of her role as Our Lady&#39;s confident. The contemporary history of the Church would hardly be complete without the inclusion of Sister Lucia&#39;s role. The references to the Holy Father and to his sufferings since the apparitions, as well as the revelation of the third part of the Secret of Fatima and the dramatic events experienced by the Church in the late second and early third millennium do not allow us to ignore Sister Lucia. Reading the biography, A Pathway Under the Gaze of Mary, gives us a broader perspective of Sister Lucia&#39;s personality. Written by the Sisters of Carmel of Coimbra, it reflects their personal knowledge of her life and writings, and provides testimonies that mirror the depth of her soul. +Most Reverend Virgilio Antunes Bishop of Coimbra</p><p></p><h2>Lost December: A Novel</h2><p>From one of America&#x2019;s most beloved storytellers comes his most spiritual book since <i>The Christmas Box.</i> The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Christmas Box </i>and The Walk<i> </i>series returns with a modern-day, Christmas-themed retelling of the story of the prodigal son.<br><br><i>It has been said that sometimes the greatest hope in our lives is just a second chance to do what we should have done right in the first place.

Dreams that could not be fulfilled.<br><br>As Peyton, son of Peythone, hid his eyes behind blue lenses, he stared across the training center&#x2019;s break room. Paradise, blooded daughter of the King&#x2019;s First Adviser, Abalone, was sitting one-�eighty on a not-�fancy chair, her legs dangling over one arm as her back rested against the other. Her blond head was down, her eyes reviewing notes on IEDs.<br><br>Improvised Explosive Devices.<br><br>Knowing what was on those pages&#x2014;�the promise of death, the reality of the war with the Lessening Society, the danger she had put herself in by joining the Black Dagger Brotherhood&#x2019;s training program for soldiers&#x2014;�made him want to take the notes away and rewind time. He wanted to return to their old lives, before she had come here to learn how to fight&nbsp;. . . and before he had learned she was so much more than an aristocratic female with a stellar bloodline and classic beauty.<br><br>Without the war, though, he doubted they would have ever grown close.<br><br>That terrible night when the Lessening Society had attacked the houses of the glymera, slaughtering whole families and legions of servants, had been the catalyst for the two of them to get tight. He had always been a hard partyer, running with a fast crowd of rich, world-�is-�my-�oyster males who frequented human clubs during the night and stayed home smoking up all day long. But after the attacks? Both of their families had decamped to safe houses outside of Caldwell, and he and Paradise had fallen into the habit of calling each other when they couldn&#x2019;t sleep.<br><br>Which had been most of the time.<br><br>They had spent hours on the phone, talking about nothing and everything, from the serious to the stoopid to the silly.<br><br>He had told her things that he had never shared with anybody: He&#x2019;d admitted to her he was scared and that he felt alone and worried about the future. Had said out loud, for the first time, that he thought he had a drug problem. Had worried about whether or not he could cut it in the real world away from the club scene.<br><br>And she had been there for him.<br><br>She was the first female friend he had ever had. Yeah, sure, he had fucked raft loads of the opposite sex, but with Paradise, it hadn&#x2019;t been about getting laid.<br><br>Although he wanted her. Of course he did. She was incredibly&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;Admit it.&#x201d;<br><br>As Paradise spoke up, he snapped to attention. Then looked around. The break room was empty except for the two of them, everybody else either in the weight room, the locker rooms, or loitering out in the hall as they waited to leave for the day.<br><br>So, yeah, she was talking to him. Looking at him, too.<br><br>&#x201c;G&#x2019;head.&#x201d; Her eyes were very direct. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you say it finally.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know how to respond to that. And when the silence stretched out between them, he felt like he&#x2019;d done a line of blow, his heart turning his rib cage into a mosh pit, his palms getting sweaty, his lids going venetian blind from the blinking.<br><br>Paradise straightened in the chair, shifting her long legs around and crossing them primly at the knee. It was a reflexive move, something that came from her lineage and her aristocratic upbringing: Every female of her station sat properly. It was just what one did, no matter where one was or what one was wearing.<br><br>Crate &amp; Barrel or Louis XIV. Lycra or Lanvin. Standards, darling.<br><br>He imagined her in a gown, dripping in her dead mahmen&#x2019;s jewels, under a ballroom&#x2019;s crystal chandelier, her hair up high, her perfect face radiant, her body&nbsp;. . . moving against his own.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your man,&#x201d; he said in a rough voice&#x2014;�one that he hoped she blamed on his weed habit.<br><br>The smile that hit her face made him feel old and ugly-�wasted, even though they were the same age and he was sober.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just getting changed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Big plans for the night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>Yeah, right. That blush told him exactly what they were going to do&#x2014;�and how much she was looking forward to it.<br><br>Popping his sunnies up, he rubbed his eyes. It was hard to believe he was never going to know what that was like&nbsp;. . . having her under him as he rode her, her naked body his to explore, her thighs spread wide so he could&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t change the subject.&#x201d; She sat forward in that chair. &#x201c;Come on. Say it. The truth will set you free, right?&#x201d;<br><br>As the compressor behind the soda machine kicked on, he glanced over at the food service counter, where meals and snacks were offered when they were logging classroom and gym time. Even though the Brothers were letting the trainees out into the field for proper engagement with the enemy, there was still a lot of theory and hand-�to-�hand and weapons work that was done on a regular basis on-�site.<br><br>At least two to three nights a week, he ate here&#x2014;�<br><br>Wow. Check it. He was trying to distract himself.<br><br>Peyton swung his stare back to her. God, she was so beautiful, so blond, with those big blue eyes&nbsp;. . . and those lips. Soft, naturally pink. Her body had gotten a little less curvy, a little more muscular, since she had started working out so much, and the power was a turn-�on.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; she murmured, &#x201c;there was a time we didn&#x2019;t keep anything from each other.&#x201d;<br><br>Not really, he thought. He had always kept his attraction to her on the DL.<br><br>&#x201c;People change.&#x201d; He stretched and cracked his back. &#x201c;Relationships, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not ours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing good can come from&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Peyton. I can feel you staring at me in class, out in the field. It&#x2019;s so damned obvious. And listen&nbsp;. . . I know where you&#x2019;re coming from. I&#x2019;m not naive.&#x201d;<br><br>The tension in her was obvious, her shoulders tight, her mouth thinning out. And hey, what do you know, he hated the position he was putting them in, too. If he could stop it, he would, but feelings were like wild animals. They did what they wanted and to hell with what they trampled or bit or kicked in the process.<br><br>&#x201c;As much as I try to ignore it&#x201d;&#x2014;she pushed her hair over her �shoulder&#x2014;&#x201c;and as much as I&#x2019;m sure you want to feel differently, it is what it is. I think we need to talk about it so we can clear the air, you know? Before it starts to affect us or the others out in the field.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s resolvable.&#x201d; Not unless you want to go on a two-�hundred and seventy-�five-�pound diet and lose your mate. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t think it matters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I disagree.&#x201d; She threw up her hands. &#x201c;Oh, come on. We&#x2019;ve been through so much together. There&#x2019;s nothing you and I can&#x2019;t handle. Remember those hours on the phone? Talk to me.&#x201d;<br><br>As Peyton wondered why in the hell he hadn&#x2019;t brought a bong with him, he got to his feet and played trailblazer with the dorm furniture that had been arranged with the care and precision of a game of marbles: The various seats, couches, and tables were willy-�nilly&#x2019;d all over the place, the result of different study groups and some questionable betting over push-�ups, sit-�ups, and arm wrestling having fucked the arrangement.<br><br>When he finally stopped, he turned around. And they both spoke at the same time.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, I&#x2019;m in love with you&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know you still don&#x2019;t approve of me&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>In another burst of synchronization, they shut up together.<br><br>&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; she breathed.<br><br>Gun. He needed a gun. So he could shoot himself in the foot in fact, as opposed to just in the hypothetical.<br><br>The door to the break room swung open and her male, Craeg, strode in like he owned the place. Big, heavily muscled, and one of the best fighters in the trainee class, he was the kind of guy who could use a rusty nail for a toothpick as he sutured up his own wounds in the middle of a burning warehouse with two lessers coming at him and a scared golden retriever puppy under his arm.<br><br>Craeg stopped and looked back and forth between them. &#x201c;Am I interrupting something?&#x201d;<br><br>Novo barely made it to the industrial-�sized metal trash bin in time. As she bent in half and threw up, nothing but water made an appearance, and when the heaving passed, she rolled off the rim and let herself fall to the mats. Easing back against the cold concrete wall, she waited for the world to stop spinning around her.<br><br>Sweat fell like tears down her face, and her throat was on fire&#x2014;�although that was less about the vomiting than the sawing inhales she had been taking as she deadlifted. And don&#x2019;t get her started on her lungs. She felt as though she had been trying to find oxygen in the middle of billowing hot smoke.<br><br>Clank. Clank. Clank&nbsp;. . .<br><br>When she was able to, she lifted her head and focused. Across the weight room, a massive male was doing leg presses in a slow, controlled fashion, his forearms bulging from where he was gripping the pegs by his hips, his thigh muscles carved in stone, veins popping out everywhere.<br><br>He was staring at her. But not in a creepy way.<br><br>More like in an okay-�is-�it-�time-�to-�call-�a-�doctor manner.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; she said, looking away from him. Although with his headphones on, it wasn&#x2019;t like he could hear her.<br><br>I&#x2019;mallright. I&#x2019;mallright. NoreallyI&#x2019;mallright&#x2014;�<br><br>Leaning to the side, she snagged a fresh white towel from a stack on one of the benches and mopped up. The Black Dagger Brotherhood&#x2019;s training center was a case of state of the art, best of the best, professional grade all the way: From this iron dungeon of self-�inflicted pain to the firing range, the classrooms, the Olympic pool, the gym, and then the medical clinic, PT facility, and surgery suites, no expense had been spared, and upkeep was just as meticulous and costly.<br><br>With a final clank, the male sat forward and did a pass of his own face. He had dark brown hair that had recently been cut, the sides so tight they were nearly shaved, the top left long and loose. His eyes were some kind of brown, and he had an all-�American kind of look&#x2014;�well, except for the fangs, which were straight-�up Bram Stoker, and the fact that he was not any more human or American than she was. The white muscle shirt he had on was stressed the fuck out trying to stretch over his enormous pecs, and his dark, hairless skin was just the same, taut nearly to the point of structural failure across his six-�pack and lats.<br><br>He had no tattoos. No false airs. Unfancy clothes. And he rarely spoke&#x2014;�if he did open his mouth, it was always logistical, like, what machine was she going to use next, or was this her towel? He was unfailingly polite, distant as a horizon, and seemingly unaware she was a female.<br><br>In short, this stranger was her new best friend. Even though she didn&#x2019;t know his name.<br><br>And they did spend a lot of time together. At the end of every in-�house night for the trainees, the two of them were here alone, the Brothers working out during the day, the other trainees already exhausted from whatever they had been doing in class.<br><br>Novo always had juice left in the tank, though.<br><br>Fuck 5-�hour Energy or Xenadrine. Personal demons were waaaaay better for getting your ass in gear.<br><br>Oh, and then there was the other reason she preferred to vom into a Hefty bag rather than hang with the others while they waited for their bus to take them down the mountain.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re bleeding.&#x201d;<br><br>Novo jerked her head up. The male was standing over her, and when she frowned, he pointed to her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Bleeding.&#x201d;<br><br>Lifting one of her palms, she saw that, yup, she certainly was �leaking. She had forgotten her gloves, and the bar that she had been holding the five hundred pounds with had cut into her.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; she asked as she pressed the towel into the raw spots.</p><h2>The Old Blue Line: A Joanna Brady Novella</h2><p><p>Butch Dixon has been taken for a ride ...</p><p>Not a jump in the car, see the sights kind of ride.

Their steppe homeland bordered on a number of sedentary states to the south - the Chinese, the Persians and the Greeks - and there were, inevitably, numerous interactions between the nomads and their neighbours. The Scythians fought the Persians on a number of occasions, in one battle killing their king and on another occasion driving the invading army of Darius the Great from the steppe. <br><br>Relations with the Greeks around the shores of the Black Sea were rather different - both communities benefiting from trading with each other. This led to the development of a brilliant art style, often depicting scenes from Scythian mythology and everyday life. It is from the writings of Greeks like the historian Herodotus that we learn of Scythian life: their beliefs, their burial practices, their love of fighting, and their ambivalent attitudes to gender. It is a world that is also brilliantly illuminated by the rich material culture recovered from Scythian burials, from the graves of kings on the Pontic steppe, with their elaborate gold work and vividly coloured fabrics, to the frozen tombs of the Altai mountains, where all the organic material - wooden carvings, carpets, saddles and even tattooed human bodies - is amazingly well preserved. <br><br>Barry Cunliffe here marshals this vast array of evidence - both archaeological and textual - in a masterful reconstruction of the lost world of the Scythians, allowing them to emerge in all their considerable vigour and splendour for the first time in over two millennia.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barry Cunliffe</strong> taught archaeology at the Universities of Bristol and Southampton and was Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford from 1972 to 2008, thereafter becoming Emeritus Professor.

Its seclusion suits former Boston police detective Bill Robinson, novice owner and innkeeper. As long as the dozen residents pay their rent, Robinson doesn't ask any questions. Neither does Sheriff Clayton Spears, who lives on the second floor. <br>Then Mitchell Cline arrives, with a deadly new way of doing business. His crew of local killers break laws, deal drugs, and bring violence to the doors of the Inn. That's when Robinson realizes, with the help of journalist Susan Solie, that leaving the city is no escape from the reality of evil -- or the responsibility for action. <br>Teaming up with Sheriff Spears and two fearless residents -- Army veteran Nick Jones and groundskeeper Effie Johnson -- Robinson begins a risky defense. The solitary inhabitants of the Inn will have to learn, before time runs out, that their only choice is between standing together -- or dying alone. <br><br><br><br></p><p>James Patterson is the world&#39;s bestselling author.

Will your major help you get the right job offers? For more than a decade, the national spotlight has focused on science and engineering as the only reliable choice for finding a successful post-grad career. Our destinies have been reduced to a caricature: learn to write computer code or end up behind a counter, pouring coffee. Quietly, though, a different path to success has been taking shape. In YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, George Anders explains the remarkable power of a liberal arts education - and the ways it can open the door to thousands of cutting-edge jobs every week.<br><br>The key insight: curiosity, creativity, and empathy aren't unruly traits that must be reined in. You can be yourself, as an English major, and thrive in sales. You can segue from anthropology into the booming new field of user research; from classics into management consulting, and from philosophy into high-stakes investing. At any stage of your career, you can bring a humanist's grace to our rapidly evolving high-tech future. And if you know how to attack the job market, your opportunities will be vast.<br><br>In this book, you will learn why resume-writing is fading in importance and why "telling your story" is taking its place. You will learn how to create jobs that don't exist yet, and to translate your campus achievements into a new style of expression that will make employers' eyes light up. You will discover why people who start in eccentric first jobs - and then make their own luck - so often race ahead of peers whose post-college hunt focuses only on security and starting pay. You will be ready for anything. <br><br></p><p><strong>George Anders</strong> is a contributing writer at Forbes, exploring issues related to careers, education and innovation.

A heavy rain was falling, and he could hardly see across the street.<br> &#x201c;Can you see to drive, Fred?&#x201d; he asked his factotum, Fred Flicker.&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Only just, sir,&#x201d; Fred replied.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go slowly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d;&nbsp; Stone found his unfinished New York Times crossword on the seat next to him; it was quite dark outside, and he switched on the reading light and started to work.<br> Traffic was slow.&nbsp; He saw a figure in black jogging toward Park Avenue with something in his hand; Stone couldn&#x2019;t tell what, and he went back to his puzzle.<br> They had reached Park Avenue, but just as they did the light turned red, and since there is no right turn on red in New York City, Fred waited for it to change.<br> A dark blur appeared to his right in Stone&#x2019;s periperal vision, but before he could turn to look at it, something struck the side window of the car with a heavy blow, and the vehicle shook slightly.&nbsp; As he turned he saw the figure in black seeming to bounce off his car and fall into the street.&nbsp; He peered out the window at the figure, who was scrambling to his feet and noted that he carried a sledge hammer.<br> Then, from behind him, came another blow to the car, then one to the left rear window.&nbsp; Finally, the figure on Stone&#x2019;s side had another go, with similar results.&nbsp; This time a star&nbsp; appeared in the window glass.<br> Fred was turning to look at him.&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &#x201c;Never mind the light, Fred, take a right quickly.&#x201d;<br> Fred did so, just as the light changed, and he was able to drive the length of the block before encountering another red light on Park.&nbsp; Stone looked over his shoulder and saw three dark figures, bearing sledge hammers, trotting toward the car.&nbsp; &#x201c;Never mind the light, Fred, GO!&#x201d; Stone shouted for emphasis.<br> Fred went and got lucky, sailing through the empty intersection.&nbsp; All the lights on Park turned green, and he made it to 57th Street before they turned red again.<br> &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Fred asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Beats me,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Drop me at the house, then take this over to the Strategic Services garage on 12th Avenue and ask them to replace my window.&nbsp; The other two seem to have survived intact.&#x201d;&nbsp; Stone had bought the car, already armored, from Strategic Services, the second-largest security company in the United States.<br> Fred pulled into the garage in Turtle Bay, so Stone wouldn&#x2019;t get wet. &#x201c;Shall I wait for the car, sir, while they repair it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, if they have the window in stock and can do it immediately; if not, just wait until the rain stops, then leave the car and take a cab back.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; &nbsp;Fred pulled out of the garage and turned west as the door closed behind him.<br> Stone took the crossword with him into his adjacent office, where his phone was ringing.&nbsp; His secretary was nowhere to be seen, so he picked it up.&nbsp; &#x201c;Stone Barrington.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dino.&#x201d; Dino Bacchetti had been Stone&#x2019;s detective partner many years before when they were both on the NYPD; by now, he had risen to the heights of Commissioner of Police.&nbsp; &#x201c;Dinner tonight?&nbsp; Patroon at seven-thirty?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure.&nbsp; Funny you should ring; I need a policeman.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Somebody take a shot at you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, but three men with sledge hammers attacked my car at Park and 76th.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did you say, &#x2018;sledge hammers&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did you have anything to drink at lunch?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They were sledge hammers, Dino.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Any damage?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;One cracked window; Fred is having it replaced at the Stategic Service shop.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, you&#x2019;ve got armored glass, haven&#x2019;t you?&nbsp; Nice to know it works.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Do you think they were after you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I could be forgiven for believing that, but I&#x2019;ve no idea why anyone would want to beat me or my car to death with sledge hammers.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s not you they were after; maybe it&#x2019;s the Bentley.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not aware of any organized hatred of Bentleys in New York, are you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Give me some time; I&#x2019;ll see if there were any other attacks on English luxury cars today.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Take all the time you like,&#x201d; Stone said.<br> &#x201c;Oh, where were you coming from?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The Carlyle; I had lunch there with Bill Eggers and a client.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you go to the U.N. this morning?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, the lunch was after Holly had departed from Washington; I drove her to the heliport.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What does Bill drive?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;A black Lincoln from a car service, I think.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How about the client?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No idea; I met him in the dining room.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Talk to you later.&#x201d; Dino hung up.<br> Joan returned from somewhere with a shopping bag.&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry I wasn&#x2019;t in when you got back; I needed some office supplies.&nbsp; Did anyone call?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just Dino.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone turned up at Patroon on time and found Dino&#x2019;s black SUV parked outside with a policeman asleep at the wheel.<br> Dino had already ordered drinks for the two of them, and Stone slid into the booth.&nbsp; The drinks came, and glasses were raised.<br> &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re not crazy,&#x201d; Dino said.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m relieved to hear it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Two other Bentleys and a Rolls were attacked within six blocks and inside of an hour of your run-in.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Anybody hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yours was the only one with armoring.&nbsp; The others ended up with a back seat full of glass, but the only passenger was in the the Rolls, and he suffered some scratches from flying glass.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Anybody I know?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Some guy from the Argentinian U.N. Consulate.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s an attack on expensive English Cars?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;More likely an attack on just expensive.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Any Mercedes or BMWs get the treatmant?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nothing reported.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then, on the available evidence . . . &#x201c;<br> &#x201d;Did you get a description?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br> &#x201c;A Ninja with a sledge hammer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It was rainng heavily, and all three men - I guess they were men - were dressed entirely in black.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Leather?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Might have been something waterproof, given the weather.&nbsp; Did you check the hardware stores to see if anybody had bought three sledge hammers?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t think of that,&#x201d; Dino replied.<br> &#x201c;Well, New York&#x2019;s finest can&#x2019;t think of everything, can you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Almost everything.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s almost enough,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dino called the following morning the moment Stone sat down at his desk.&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you see the <i>Times</i> coverage of Holly&#x2019;s speech this morning?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I did; overwhelmingly positive, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Me, too.&nbsp; Did you see Gloria Parsons&#x2019;s op-ed piece?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t gotten that far yet.&nbsp; What the hell is Gloria doing on the <i>Times</i> op-ed page?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Her boyfriend, the ex-governor&#x2019;s influence, I expect; also, the woman is a good writer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What did she have to say?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Read it for yourself.&nbsp; By the way, your guess was&nbsp; inspired,&#x201d; Dino said.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About the sledgehammers.&nbsp; A woman visited a hardware store on 3rd Avenue, in the twenties, and bought three sledgehammers.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They had to get them somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She was about five-eight, a hundred and forty pounds, fairly short, dark hair, age thirty to forty, wearing a trench coat over black pants.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did she pay by credit card?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That would be too easy; she paid cash.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did the store deliver them?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, she bought a canvas carryall and took them away in that.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re stuck.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Every cop on the East Side, upper and lower, is looking for people dressed in black, carrying a sledgehammer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Brilliant police work.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It will be, if they spot somebody matching the description.&nbsp; Did you see any of these people before they started banging on your car?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, come to think of it; as I left the Carlyle I saw somebody dressed in black - I assumed it was some sort of rainwear - and carrying something, though I couldn&#x2019;t tell what, it was raining so hard.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Headed toward Park?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, on the downtown side of the street.&nbsp; Does that matter?&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;I have no idea; I&#x2019;m just being thorough.&#x201d;<br> Have you had any reports of further Bentley abuse today?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not yet, but I&#x2019;ve had a hot call from the Bentley distributor, demanding action.&nbsp; Nothing from the Rolls people.&#x201d;<br> Stone laughed.&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Did you get your car fixed?&#x201d;&nbsp; Dino asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it took a couple of hours, but Strategic Services came up with a window and installed it.&nbsp; The other two windows were unmarked.&nbsp; The workman said they should have used a pickaxe.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Because a pickaxe is pointed, and it would have had a better chance of penetrating the armored glass, because it would have concentrated the force into a smaller area than a sledgehammer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Shall I put out an APB on people buying pickaxes?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&nbsp; Anything at all on the woman who bought the sledgehammers?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, the store said she wasn&#x2019;t a regular customer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;After all, how many sledgehammers does a girl need?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Only three, apparently; I guess they last awhile.&nbsp; Is there anything else your police department can do for you today?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nope.&nbsp; Keep up the good work.&#x201d;<br> Dino hung up.<br> Joan came in with the <i>New York Post</i> and put it on his desk.&nbsp; &#x201c;Your incident of yesterday made the <i>Post</i>,&#x201d; she said.<br> &#x201c;LUXURY CARS ATTACKED WITH SLEDGEHAMMERS!&#x201d; the headline screamed.&nbsp; The article was short, though, and there was no theory on why.<br> &#x201c;I guess the <i>Times</i> ignored it,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;At least, I didn&#x2019;t see anything about it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not shocking enough,&#x201d; she said, then went back to her desk.<br> A little further inside the <i>Post</i> was an editorial on Holly&#x2019;s appearance at the U.N.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;WOUNDED MADAME SECRETARY KNOCKS ONE OUT OF THE PARK,&#x201d; read the headline, and all two paragraphs were entirely favorable.&nbsp; &#x201c;Have we got a president-in-the-making here?&#x201d; it finished.&nbsp; Stone reflected that Dino thought the bullet was meant for him, not Holly.&nbsp; The ex-con gunman, shot by Fred, had not been found to have a motive to shoot either Stone or Holly, and the case had petered out.<br><br>Stone picked up the <i>Times</i> and turned to the op-ed page.&nbsp; There was Gloria&#x2019;s piece.&nbsp; &#x201c;Barker throws her shoulder into the ring?&#x201d; read the lead.&nbsp; Stone read on:<br> &#x201c;Secretary of State Holly Barker, substitution at the U.N. for the president, brought the General Assembly to its collective feet when she appeared with her arm in a sling, albeit a silken one from Hermes.&nbsp; This is surely the first time a wounded cabinet member has risen from a hospital bed after an assassination attempt to address the world.&nbsp; It must be something like the reception Abraham Lincoln would have received in Congress, had his wound been to the shoulder, instead of to the head.<br> &#x201c;President Katharine Lee, who of late, has been somewhat unpopular in certain quarters of the international community, thus won a victory for her policies by the simple device of not showing up, and instead, dispatching her glamorous secretary of state to stand in for her.<br> Secretary Barker has recently been seen with her president in half a dozen appearances where one might not expect a cabinet member to be seen in such high company, which indicates both her high standing in her boss&#x2019;s opinion and maybe even a hint ast to who the president might like to see succeed her in office.&nbsp; There seems to be a wide-spread view in both houses of Congress that president could do a lot worse than Holly Barker.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It went on like that for another six paragraphs.&nbsp; Stone found a pair of scissors in his desk drawer and clipped both the <i>&nbsp;Times<b> </b></i>op-ed piece and the <i>Post</i> editorial.&nbsp; He buzzed Joan.&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Yes, boss?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t somebody give me a nice, leather scrapbook for Christmas a couple of years ago?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, boss; I&#x2019;ve been keeping it in the hope that you might do something that would engender some favorable press clippings.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Forget about that, but bring me the scrapbook, please.&#x201d;<br> Joan hustled into his office and removed the album from its box.<br> Stone handed her the clippings.&nbsp; &#x201c;You are now the official archivist for our Secretary of State,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Soon to be our next president?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear that from me,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; She took the clippings and the album and returned to her office.</p><h2>Shop Reference for Students &amp; Apprentices (Volume 1)</h2><p>From the ability to understand and use shop mathematics to the reading and interpreting of shop drawings, the editor's intent is to provide the information and know-how that students will need as they prepare themselves for jobs in metalworking industries.

He collects key passages and offers incisive commentary, making <i>Confessions</i> accessible to any reader who is both intellectually curious and spiritually hungry.</p><p>The <i>Confessions</i> is a dramatic personal narrative of a soul choosing between eternal life and death, an exploration of the timeless questions great minds have been asking for millennia, and a prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God. <i>I Burned for Your Peace</i> is not a scholarly work but an unpacking of the riches found in Augustine's text. It is existential, personal, and devotional, as well as warm, witty, and thought-provoking. With Kreeft to guide them, readers of the <i>Confessions</i> can overhear and understand the intimate conversation between a towering intellect and the God whose peace he at last humbly accepts.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</b>, Professor of Philosophy at Boston College, is one of the most respected Christian authors of our time.

In 1932 he gave up the theater to devote his attention to his studies in mysticism when he began his lecture career in New York City. After traveling throughout the country, he eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the late 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television, and for many years, lectured regularly to capacity audiences at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Although Neville&#39;s career peaked in the late 1950s and early 60s, his message continues to find a place in the hearts of spiritual readers throughout the world today.

From Homer to Hawthorne, Plato to Pascal, and Shakespeare to Solzhenitsyn, the great writers of Western civilization can be found in its pages. In addition, this new edition offers a much broader representation of women authors, such as Charlotte Bront%, Emily Dickinson and Edith Wharton, as well as non-Western writers such as Confucius, Sun-Tzu, Chinua Achebe, Mishima Yukio and many others. <p>This fourth edition also features a simpler format that arranges the works chronologically in five sections (The Ancient World; 300-1600; 1600-1800; and The 20th Century), making them easier to look up than ever before. It deserves a place in the libraries of all lovers of literature.</p></p><p>In print for almost 40 years, <i>The Lifetime Reading Plan</i> has long been a worthy addition to any serious reader's bookshelf, providing entertaining and informative introductions to the great works of Western civilization. Now, this "classic about classics" has been updated to reflect more diverse traditions. <i>The New Lifetime Reading Plan</i> recommends great literature from around the globe, including writers and works from Confucius to Chinua Achebe, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez to the Koran. Also new is an appendix profiling books by 100 important 20th-century authors--or "temporary classics," as coauthor John S. Major calls them.<p>Readers may argue with some of the selections (or, more likely, the omissions). Others may quarrel with the editors' opinions; they routinely analyze artists' "characters,"with occasionally prissy or patronizing results. (Of Walt Whitman, for instance, coauthor Clifton Fadiman declares that "He had an original temperament, a certain peasant shrewdness, but only a moderate amount of brains.") But no one can argue with the book's mission: promoting the classics as "life companions." "Once part of you, they work in and on and with you until you die," Fadiman writes in the introduction. Anyone seeking a guide to the vast riches of world literature need look no further than the <i>The New Lifetime Reading Plan</i>; it provides a gateway to the greatest achievements of the human mind.</p>Clifton Fadiman (1904-1999) was a well-known American author, editor, public intellectual, and radio and television personality.</p><h2>Depressed and Anxious: The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Workbook for Overcoming Depression &amp; Anxiety</h2><p><p>As if coping with feelings of depression or anxiety by themselves weren&#x2019;t difficult enough, clinical research suggests that as many as 60 percent of depression sufferers concurrently experience some kind of anxiety disorder. If you are in this group, it is quite common to simultaneously experience profound loss of energy and initiative along with substantial stress and anxiety. Caught between the push and pull of these two conditions, you might find that neither is easy even to recognize, much less cope with. But, by adapting for the first time the powerful techniques of dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT, to the special needs of people troubled by co-occurring depression and anxiety, this book offers powerful tools for overcoming this condition. DBT is designed for people who have lost hope and meaningfulness in life, who question their own ability to be influential in their world, who find their emotions intolerable, and who find that they try to escape and avoid important aspects of their lives. DBT may be just the tool you&#x2019;ve been looking for to move beyond depression and anxiety. </p> <p>The step-by-step exercises, techniques, and worksheets in this book work to identify painful inner conflicts that might underlie depression and anxiety symptoms. Then, by negotiating a series of compromises, the techniques help acknowledge these issues while limiting their ability to interfere with your life&#x2014;effectively reducing the extent to which your emotions govern who you are or what you are capable of. This book explains mindfulness techniques that encourage participation in the world and allow easier adaptation to change. It treats the difference between &#x201c;threat cues&#x201d; and &#x201c;safety cues&#x201d; and how recognizing and reacting to them constructively can reduce the effects of anxiety and depression. By teaching you how to monitor and limit negative self-evaluations and how to best tolerate negative experience, this book gives you a powerful set of tools for the control of co-occurring depression and anxiety.</p></p><p>An expert in dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT, shows readers who struggle with both anxiety and depression how to use ideas from this powerful therapy to relieve their symptoms and regain control of their lives. Readers use mindfulness techniques and cognitive behavioral strategies to tolerate distress, silence negative self-talk, and resolve inner dialectical conflict. <p>� Statisticians report that more than 50 million Americans suffer from depression and anxiety <br>� This is the first book to address co-occurring depression and anxiety <br>� From a leading expert in dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT&#x2014;the newest, breakthrough model in psychology today</p>Thomas Marra, PhD, founded and directed one of the first inpatient psychiatric programs using dialectic behavior therapy as the clinical focus of treatment for every patient admitted to the facility, regardless of diagnosis. He has practical and theoretical experience in treating a wide patient population using the principles and strategies of DBT.

Her story on migrant workers won first prize for Picture Story of the Year from the National Press Photographers Association. She lives in Mill Valley, California with her husband Cotton Coulson.Ages 5-9. The popular myth of the first Thanksgiving--that brave peaceful settlers in 1621 invited a few wild Indians over for dinner--gets overthrown in this handsome, large-size photo-essay that combines bright, colorful pageantry with hard historical fact. Last year the living history museum of Plimoth Plantation reenacted the 1621 harvest gathering, and this book is based on that event; in fact, much of it reads like a museum visit. The very order of the text--beginning with the Wampanoag Indian people who had lived on the land for thousands of years before the English "discovered" it--sets the stage for the full account of our shared history. It's interesting to see the errors that have become tradition (for example, there were no cranberries or potatoes in America at that time) and connect them with lies about "discovery" that have come down through history. There's no heavy lecturing, and in the pictures everyone is having a good time. It's the evolution of the holiday, the story of the broken peace, that reveals why Native Americans do not celebrate the holiday. This is a fine book for the classroom; use it to talk about how history is written, who tells it, and what happened. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A pioneering forester, sportsman, wildlife manager, and ecologist, he was also a gifted writer whose farsighted land ethic is proving increasingly relevant in our own time. Now, Leopold&#x2019;s essential contributions to our literature&#x2013;&#x2013;some hard-to-find or previously unpublished&#x2013;&#x2013;are gathered in a single volume for the first time. Here is his classic <i>A</i> <i>Sand County Almanac</i>, hailed&#x2013;&#x2013;with Thoreau&#x2019;s <i>Walden</i> and Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i>&#x2013;&#x2013;as one of the main literary influences on the modern environmental movement. Published in 1949, it is still astonishing today: a vivid, firsthand, philosophical tour de force. Along with <i>Sand</i> <i>County </i>are more than fifty articles, essays, and lectures exploring the new complexities of ecological science and what we would now call environmental ethics. Leopold&#x2019;s sharp-eyed, often humorous journals are illustrated here for the first time with his original photographs, drawings, and maps. Also unique to this collection is a selection of over 100 letters, most of them never before published, tracing his personal and professional evolution and his efforts to foster in others the love and sense of responsibility he felt for the land.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p>Published in 1949, shortly after the author's death, <i>A Sand County Almanac</i> is a classic of nature writing, widely cited as one of the most influential nature books ever published. Writing from the vantage of his summer shack along the banks of the Wisconsin River, Leopold mixes essay, polemic, and memoir in his book's pages. In one famous episode, he writes of killing a female wolf early in his career as a forest ranger, coming upon his victim just as she was dying, "in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes.... I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view." Leopold's road-to-Damascus change of view would find its fruit some years later in his so-called land ethic, in which he held that nothing that disturbs the balance of nature is right. Much of <i>Almanac</i> elaborates on this basic premise, as well as on Leopold's view that it is something of a human duty to preserve as much wild land as possible, as a kind of bank for the biological future of all species. Beautifully written, quiet, and elegant, Leopold's book deserves continued study and discussion today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>A profoundly affecting work.

No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss-an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc.- is sure to be noticed.<br><br>S�ren Kierkegaard<br><br>Togetherness<br><br>At the heart of hygge is an experience of belonging and a sense of connection. It's most often associated with being in the company of others, but we can enjoy hygge alone.<br><br>Hygge satisfies our natural longing to belong. Like the emergence of fireflies, when we hygger we shine individually but glow in unison to reveal an inclination toward a powerful collective harmony. It is a practice that connects our individual experience, our feelings of mutuality with others, our collective ideals, and the tangible qualities of objects, spaces, and places.<br><br>Hygge can be found in the settings where we feel most comfortably human, that give us context, offer identity, relation, and history. We hygger on our porch swings, armchairs, doorsteps, and in our beds, local bars, village halls, and bookshops.<br><br>To be in a situation characterized by hygge is to be in a state of pleasant well-being and security, with a relaxed frame of mind and an open enjoyment of the immediate situation in all its small pleasures. It is a state one achieves most often with close members of one's social network-with one's family, extended family, and friends.<br><br>Judith Friedman Hansen<br><br>The importance of place<br><br>Life in Denmark is harnessed to community, and Danes grow up with a strong sense of connection to their home, their street, their country.<br><br>Hygge is a phenomenon that reflects our way of inhabiting the world. A sense of interconnection is the glue that binds us in an experience of hygge-to each other and to place.<br><br>When we hygger, we feel firmly located-secured and present. We thrive on a strong sense of place. Our souls are fed by the predictable rhythm of returning to settings that are comforting in their familiarity-a local coffee shop, a particular tree, an aunt's quiet apartment, a regular swimming spot.<br><br>The routines that shape our days locate us-from the places we visit to the small rituals that give us pause. Drinking tea first thing in the morning from a favorite mug, or stopping for a glass of wine on a friend's balcony on the way home from work, confirm our feelings of rootedness. Noticing the distinct characteristics of a place and taking notice of the changing seasons makes us feel an integral part of our environment.<br><br>Wherever we gather in the spirit of hygge, whether it's beside a barbecue on a beach or around a table in a bar on a cold autumn night, we feel anchored.<br><br>When we hygger, we unwrap a package of good feelings to share and offer each other, signs of encouragement and symbols of inclusion; we make arrangements that provide warmth, shelter, nourishment, and comfort-by doing something as simple as lighting a candle at the table, pulling up chairs to sit together for a shared meal, or taking cake into the office and inviting others stop for long enough to enjoy a slice with a cup of coffee.<br><br>Circle of warmth<br><br>To hygge is to create an enclosing circle of warmth by establishing an inclusive, relaxed atmosphere and a single point of focus to secure and celebrate the passing moment. The primal comfort of an open fire and good company on a dark night are the epitome of hygge. A cluster of people sitting beneath the encircling glow of a pendant lamp hung low over a table is a common sight in Denmark-the light seems to hold everyone together, to define them as a unit.<br><br>Clustering together<br><br>Hygge is a physical and psychological clustering together for affirmation and a sense of belonging.<br><br>In Denmark, most gatherings are patterned by a cluster of people sharing a single focus of awareness that everyone helps to sustain-commonly a table surrounded by people pressed together and united in maintaining conversation, like keeping a fire burning in the hearth.<br><br>Danes prefer to gather in limited numbers rather than in large, expansive groups, to emphasize the unity of their small circles. Bubbles of interaction are everywhere-outside on a street lined with caf&#x17d;s, and in the privacy of their homes. Everyone creates their own groups, their own foundations for hygge. Although it's a pattern of behavior that the Danes have carefully honed, it's a non-verbal vocabulary that belongs to us all. Hygge happens wherever people gather in a wholehearted and inclusive way, whether it's an unexpected encounter on a sidewalk or a birthday celebration in a kitchen. Hygge is about human connection.<br><br>The centripetal force of mutuality, warmth, and enthusiasm that binds a group is sometimes intimidating and impenetrable. There are times when we find ourselves in the role of a stranger standing on the margins, examining everything that seems to be unquestionable to members of an inner circle. Feeling excluded from a group is uncomfortable. Feeling trapped inside one is equally disquieting. There is the downside that the Danish style of socializing could be considered exclusive.<br><br>But hygge is a process that usually draws a person in and invites engagement. In the face of tensions that threaten to pull families, friends, and colleagues apart, an experience of hygge helps bind us together.<br><br>Family<br><br>Hygge can often be distilled to an experience of kinship, of being with those who understand us and signal that we are wholly accepted.<br><br>True kinship takes a warm heart. In essence, it is about being together, deeply honestly. We talk about love so much but we forget that it is something we give rather than get: a way of being.<br><br>Ilse Crawford<br><br>There is an honesty to a hyggelig encounter that echoes the dynamics of ideal family life. Hygge and our ideas of family are interwoven, both associated with care and intimacy. Many of us think of family as a place that satisfies the heart. Addressing the needs of the heart, warmth, amity, and belonging are the essence of what we experience and offer when we hygger. We feel warmed when we step into a hyggeligt environment. We can be unguarded, carefree, and willing to be seen.<br><br>If we're fortunate, we can be our most unselfconscious with our relations and those who share the places we inhabit-our homes and our communities. The word inhabit comes from a root that means to give and to receive, and hygge stems from reciprocity and love.<br><br>Considering family togetherness seems promising for understanding hygge in its most basic form. . . . When we refer to hygge, we are using the concepts of home and family to think with.<br><br>Jeppe Trolle Linnet<br><br>Family is cherished in Scandinavian culture, and even though it is far from reality in many places, the ideal of a stable family remains a touchstone for many Danes. Regardless of its shape, modern family is seen as a place of intimacy and integration that can prepare and restore each family member for encounters with the outside world.<br><br>Work<br><br>In Denmark, professional environments often display the qualities that many of us would associate with a familial context-informality, casual dress, and comfortable furniture arranged to encourage familiarity and diminish isolation. Danish working culture is based on open communication, collaboration, and flat hierarchy. Danes are innately skeptical about the value of strategic maneuvering at home or at work. They desire to be seen in the fullness of who they are, wherever they are. Employees are considered team members. Each person is expected to take their personal responsibilities seriously in return for influence and the degree of flexibility required to have a career without compromising work-life balance.<br><br>Knowing that our individual contribution is recognized and working together as a team give us a sense of belonging. With mutual trust and comfortable dialogue, work can be an experience of hygge for as long as it's possible to maintain an even and comfortable pace. If we become too busy, our time cramped with many activities, hygge disappears but is easy to reignite by pausing for coffee or making a habit of stopping to eat lunch together.<br><br>Trust<br><br>There's a freedom of self-expression implicit in hygge that rests on reciprocity and mutual trust. Embedded in an experience of hygge is a shared belief that good things will happen, and that all members of a group will be given equal voice and offered recognition. Everyone present is considered part of a greater whole. Each person wants everyone else to feel good.<br><br>Understanding that we are welcome encourages us to let go and allow ourselves to be seen without the need to perform or scramble for attention.<br><br>Hygge invites feelings of harmony and mutuality that overcome barriers and facilitate communication; we no longer feel separate when we hygger. The shape of family life has changed; many of us live alone. We look for belonging and connection in our local communities-in caf&#x17d;s, corner shops, and restaurants. We can hygge to help bridge the space between being alone and feeling lonely.<br><br>Participants experience a "social intimacy" and a basic "trust" in the inclusiveness and good intentions of the other people present. Hygge cannot be achieved if there is disagreement and conflict in the group or if there is a sense of distrust between people. Furthermore, situations characterized by hygge eschew graveness and seriousness.<br><br>Carsten Levisen<br><br>We usually hygger to establish a human factor in our lives, to enjoy the warm aura of friendship and the security of kinship, the benefits of shared activity, physical closeness, and the warmth of proximity.<br><br>A rich social life (measured by quality of experience rather than quantity of friends) contributes to good health, happiness, and longevity. So many of us place value on hard work, measurable achievement, and wealth, and often fail to set aside time to nurture our relationships and strengthen social ties. We make the mistake of believing that security is found in material things rather than people.<br><br>In concentrating on friendship and empathy, in paying attention to our relationships with people and place, we address the needs of our environment-the society that we live in and our planet. Sustainability depends on community-when we learn to be happily reliant on each other, we're less likely to turn to material consumption to meet our emotional needs.<br><br>Belonging to the moment<br><br>Hygge helps us to enter a moment or a place. By appealing to our senses and promising security, it draws us in, attuning us to the spirit of a location, inviting us to relax and connect to ourselves and to others. It facilitates a sense of being fully present and opens us to the pleasures of the occasion.<br><br>There is a slight anxiety implicit in hygge that heightens our experience of belonging to the moment-the knowledge that there is a world of activity and responsibility just beyond the instant, poised to impose, intertwines with our situation, enlivening us to its particulars and pleasures. The flip side of an experience of enjoyment is the certainty that it won't last forever. Today's moment of hygge will be tomorrow's memory. With that awareness, we give ourselves over to the moment more completely.<br><br>It must be emphasized that hygge entails commitment to the present moment and a readiness to set distractions aside.<br><br>Judith Friedman Hansen<br><br>Hygge is evoked in situations where there is nothing to accomplish but letting go to the present moment in a way that's more aligned to simple pleasure than deep reflection.<br><br>Experiencing a sense of presence and belonging is challenging when we're stressed or distracted. Hygge isn't the complete absence of the usual demands of a fully engaged human life, but it is facilitated by a willingness to put down our problems and abandon our cares for a while.<br><br>At the heart of hygge is a willingness to set aside time for simply being with people and, ideally, having all the time in the world for them. Hygge is a vehicle for showing that we care. It's a way of paying attention to our children or partners and friends in the messy reality of the here and now, and putting down the distractions that pull us in different directions. So many of us are drawn to a virtual world of connectivity. Hygge isn't about a life without technology, but it asks us to balance our commitments and remember the value of human interaction, conversation, and physical intimacy. It liberates us to fully inhabit the moment without feeling compelled to record it.<br><br>Spontaneity and immediacy characterize hygge, as does a willingness to accept our differences and enjoy an atmosphere of tolerance and peace.<br><br>The salient feature of hygge is the atmosphere of warm and relaxed enjoyment of the moment which it allows. While it is nurtured by thoughtfulness and mutual involvement, hygge is informal and unrestrained.<br><br>Judith Friedman Hansen<br><br>When we feel held by the atmosphere of a place or captured by the pleasure of an encounter, hygge is being evoked. Atmosphere binds us together, weaves us into the particulars of a place, and makes us feel at home with ourselves and with those around us.<br><br>Belonging to ourselves<br><br>Achieving the serenity and freedom of feeling that we belong to ourselves, wherever we are, is a common concern in our mobile lives. The practice of hygge can instill stability of presence, a state of awareness and ease, by creating a frame around us, offering us comfort, giving us a point of focus, and allowing us to relax enough to be ourselves.<br><br>Hygge relies on us finding a balance between self-containment and wholehearted participation, personal liberty and awareness of the needs of others. It connotes a caring, civilized mode of behavior that builds companionable ease and trust.<br><br>The most common form of despair is not being who you are.<br><br>S�ren Kierkegaard<br><br>In Denmark, the ability to be at peace with oneself is a character trait that is highly respected. A person who simply lives up to their own standards and appears at ease in their environment, who seems to eschew jostling for a place in social hierarchy and competitive behavior, is described as able to hvile i sig selv-rest in oneself, be comfortable in one's own skin. It is a quality that suggests an inner stability of identity that is not dependent on attention or status. It is a quality that suggests an inner stability of identity that is not dependent on attention or status. People who are innately comfortable hygger with ease. They are less self-conscious or immersed in self-presentation and unlikely to indulge in one-upmanship. Those who are prepared to leave their problems at the door, who aren't preoccupied with the concerns of their lives outside of the hyggelig sphere also support the dynamics of hygge. Holding on to our identity is a challenge for all of us. Often it is easier on home ground where we operate in a knowable sphere. And easier in a country like Denmark where there are not huge disparities between people, so their identities are less likely to be usurped by their social or professional position.</p><h2>Beginning Biblical Hebrew</h2><p><p>Achieving the right balance of amount of information, style of presentation, and depth of instruction in first-year grammars is no easy task. But Mark Futato has produced a grammar that, after years of testing in a number of institutions, will please many, with its concise, clear, and well-thought-out presentation of Biblical Hebrew. Because the teaching of biblical languages is in decline in many seminaries and universities, Futato takes pains to measure the amount of information presented in each chapter in a way that makes the quantity digestible, without sacrificing information that is important to retain. The book includes exercises that are drawn largely from the Hebrew Bible itself.</p><p><em>Fourth printing, 2012.</em></p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Mark D. Futato&#39;s new Hebrew grammar is a simple, thoughtful, and straightforward work that reflects genuine empathy for the beginning Hebrew student. The agenda of the book is to provide the fundamentals of the language unencumbered by information that may fog the road toward basic Hebrew competency. Futato&#39;s tenure in the classroom and interface with Hebrew novices prove to be an asset to Beginning Biblical Hebrew. The grammar&#39;s strength is Futato&#39;s keen pedagogical sensitivity reflected at various points in its appearance and presentation of the language. Futato chooses to impart his expertise in a larger book using larger type, even in the English sections of the book. This provides a positive and welcoming effect for the beginner and helps prevent the student from becoming overwhelmed with the data on a page. His student-centered approach is detected no later than in the introduction of the Hebrew alphabet, where the characters are displayed not only in typed form but also in handwritten style with detailed instructions as to how to fashion the letters. He also uses unique ways of getting the student to adjust to reading right to left and uniquely capitalizes upon the student&#39;s familiarity with English to grow comfortable in the pronunciation of foreign letters and words. Futato&#39;s goals and objectives listed in the introduction demonstrate a realistic vision for the beginning student.s anticipated abilities after working through the book. The student.s expectation is set at the right place in order to avoid frustration and disappointment.</p><h2>Someone to Hold: Camille&#39;s Story (The Westcott Series)</h2><p><b>A reversal of fortune befalls a young woman in this charming Westcott novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Someone to Wed</i>.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>Humphrey Wescott, Earl of Riverdale, has died, leaving behind a fortune and a scandalous secret that will forever alter the lives of his family&#x2014;sending one daughter on a journey of self-discovery...</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> With her parents&#x2019; marriage declared bigamous, Camille Westcott is now illegitimate and without a title.

The concept of camouflage often involved more than patterned BDUs. No, wait, they weren&#x2019;t called that anymore, were they? Now they were called &#x201c;Army combat uniforms,&#x201d; ACUs. <i>Same, same.</i></p><p>Driscoll&#x2019;s beard was fully four inches long, with enough flecks of white in it that his men had taken to calling him Santa&#x2014;rather annoying to a man hardly thirty-six years old, but when most of your compatriots were an average of ten years younger than you . . . Oh, well. Could be worse. Could be &#x201c;Pops&#x201d; or &#x201c;Gramps.&#x201d;</p><p>He was even more annoyed to have long hair. It was dark and shaggy and greasy, and his beard coarse, which was useful here, where the facial hair was important to his cover and the local people rarely bothered with haircuts. His dress was entirely local in character, and this was true of his team as well. There were fifteen of them. Their company commander, a captain, was down with a broken leg from a misstep&#x2014;which was all it took to sideline you in this terrain&#x2014;sitting on a hilltop and waiting for the Chinook to evac him, along with one of the team&#x2019;s two medics who&#x2019;d stayed behind to make sure he didn&#x2019;t go into shock. That left Driscoll in command for the mission. He didn&#x2019;t mind. He had more time in the field than Captain Wilson had, though the captain had a college degree, and Driscoll didn&#x2019;t have his yet. One thing at a time. He had to survive this deployment still, and after that he could go back to his classes at the University of Georgia. Funny, he thought, that it had taken him nearly three decades to start enjoying school. Well, hell, better late than never, he supposed.</p><p>He was tired, the kind of mind-numbing, bone-grinding fatigue Rangers knew only too well. He knew how to sleep like a dog on a granite block with only a rifle stock for a pillow, knew how to stay alert when his brain and body were screaming at him to lie down. Problem was, now that he was closer to forty than thirty, he felt the aches and pains a little more than he had when he was twenty, and it took twice as long to work out the kinks in the morning. Then again, those aches were offset by wisdom and experience. He&#x2019;d learned over the years that despite it being a clich�, it was in fact mind over matter. He&#x2019;d learned to largely block out pain, which was a handy skill when you were leading much younger men whose packs undoubtedly felt much lighter on their shoulders than Driscoll&#x2019;s did on his own. Life, he decided, was all about trade-offs.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been in the hills for two days, all of it on the move, sleeping two to three hours a night. He was part of the Special Operations team of the 75th Ranger Regiment, based permanently at Fort Benning, Georgia, where there was a nice NCO club with good beer on tap. By closing his eyes and concentrating, he imagined he could still taste the cold beer, but that moment passed quickly. He had to focus here, every second. They were fifteen thousand feet above sea level, in the Hindu Kush mountains, in that gray zone that was both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and neither&#x2014;at least to the locals. Lines on maps didn&#x2019;t make borders, Driscoll knew, especially in Indian country like this. He&#x2019;d check his GPS equipment to be sure of his position, but latitude and longitude really didn&#x2019;t matter to his mission. What mattered was where they were headed, regardless of where it fell on the map.</p><p>The local population knew little about borders, and didn&#x2019;t especially care. For them reality was which tribe you were in, which family you were a part of, and which flavor of Muslim you were. Here memories lasted a hundred years, and the stories even longer. And grudges even longer than that. The locals still boasted that their ancestors had driven Alexander the Great out of the country, and some of them still remembered the names of the warriors who had bested the Macedonian spearmen who had up until then conquered every other place they&#x2019;d wandered into. Most of all, though, the locals spoke of the Russians, and how many of those they&#x2019;d killed, mostly by ambush, some with knives, face-to-face. They smiled and laughed with those stories, legends passed on from father to son. Driscoll doubted the Russian soldiers who made it out of Afghanistan did much laughing about the experience. No, sir, these were not nice folks, he knew. They were scary-tough, hardened by weather, war, famine, and just generally trying to stay alive in a country that seemed to be doing its best to kill you most of the time. Driscoll knew he ought to feel some sympathy for them. God had just dealt them a bad hand, and maybe that wasn&#x2019;t their fault, but it wasn&#x2019;t Driscoll&#x2019;s fault, either, nor his concern. They were enemies of Driscoll&#x2019;s country, and the powers-that-be had pointed the stick at them and ordered &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; and so here they were. That was the central truth of the moment, the reason he was in these goddamned mountains.</p><p>One more ridge was the other central truth, especially here, it seemed. They&#x2019;d legged it fifteen klicks, almost all of it uphill and over sharp rock and scree, since they&#x2019;d hopped off the CH-47 Chinook helicopter, a Delta variant, the only one at their disposal that could handle the altitude here.</p><p><i>There . . . the ridgeline. Fifty meters.</i></p><p>Driscoll slowed his pace. He was walking point, leading the patrol as the senior NCO present, with his men stretched out a hundred meters to his rear, alert, eyes sweeping left and right, up and down, M4 carbines at ready-low and trained at their sectors. They expected there to be a few sentries on the ridgeline. The locals might be uneducated in the traditional sense, but they weren&#x2019;t stupid by any measure, which was why the Rangers were running this op at night&#x2014;0144, or a quarter to two in the morning&#x2014;according to his digital watch. No moon tonight, and high clouds thick enough to block whatever light came from the stars. Good hunting weather, he thought.</p><p>His eyes traced more down than up. He didn&#x2019;t want to make any noise, and noise came from the feet. One damned rock, kicked loose and rolling down the hillside, could betray them all. Couldn&#x2019;t have that, could he? Couldn&#x2019;t waste the three days and fifteen klicks it had taken them to get this close.</p><p>Twenty meters to the ridgeline. Sixty-five feet.</p><p>His eyes searched the line for movement. Nothing close. A few more steps, looking left and right, his noise-suppressed carbine cradled to his chest at ready-low, finger resting lightly on the trigger, just enough to know it was there.</p><p>It was hard to explain to people how hard this was, how tiring and debilitating&#x2014;far more so than a hike in the woods&#x2014;knowing there might be someone with an AK-47 in his hands and his finger on a trigger, the selector switch set to full auto, ready to cut your ass in half. His men would take care of such a person, but that wouldn&#x2019;t do him any good, Driscoll knew. Still, he consoled himself, if it happened, the odds were that he wouldn&#x2019;t even know it. He&#x2019;d dispatched enough enemies to know how it worked: One moment you&#x2019;re stepping forward, eyes scanning ahead, ears tuned, listening for danger . . . the next nothing. Death.</p><p>Driscoll knew the rule out here, in the badlands, in the dead of night: Slow is fast. Move slow, walk slow, step carefully. It had served him well lo these many years.</p><p>Just six months earlier he&#x2019;d finished third in the Best Ranger Competition, the Super Bowl of Special Operations troops. Driscoll and Captain Wilson, in fact, entered as Team 21. The captain had to be pissed at the broken leg. He was a pretty good Ranger, Driscoll thought, but a broken tibia was a broken tibia. When a bone broke, there wasn&#x2019;t a whole hell of a lot to be done about it. A torn muscle hurt like hell but got better rapidly. On the other hand, a broken bone had to knit and mend, and that meant lying on your back for a few weeks at an Army hospital before the docs let you put weight on it again. Then you had to learn to run again, after you relearned how to walk. What a pain in the ass that would be.... He&#x2019;d been lucky in his career, having suffered nothing worse than a twisted ankle, a broken pinkie, and a bone-bruised hip, none of which had sidelined him for much longer than a week. Not so much as a bullet or shrapnel graze. The Ranger gods had smiled on him for sure.</p><p>Five more steps . . .</p><p><i>Okay, there you are . . . Yep.</i> As he&#x2019;d expected, there was the sentry, right where he should be. Twenty-five meters to his right. It was just too obvious a spot for a sentry, though this particular one was doing a piss-poor job of it, sitting there, looking backward mostly, probably bored and half asleep and counting the minutes until his relief arrived. Well, boredom could kill you, and it was about to kill this guy in less than a minute, though he&#x2019;d never even realize it. <i>Unless I miss the shot,</i> Driscoll reminded himself, knowing he wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>He turned one last time, scanning the area through his PVS-17 night-vision goggles. <i>Nobody else close. Okay.</i> He settled down, tucked the carbine to his right shoulder and centered the sights on the guy&#x2019;s right ear, controlled his breathing&#x2014;</p><p>To his right, down a narrow trail, came the rasp of leather on rock.</p><p>Driscoll froze.</p><p>He did a quick mental recheck, placing the rest of the team in his mind&#x2019;s eye. Anyone down that way? No. Most of the team was spread out behind him and to his right. Moving with exaggerated slowness, Driscoll rotated his head in the direction of the sound. Nothing in the night vision. He lowered his carbine, laying it diagonally across his chest. He looked left. Ten feet away, Collins crouched behind a rock. Driscoll gestured: <i>Sound to the left; take two men.</i> Collins nodded and crab-walked backward out of sight. Driscoll did the same, then laid himself flat between a pair of scrub bushes.</p><p>Down the trail, another sound now: liquid splattering against stone. This brought a smile to Driscoll&#x2019;s lips. <i>The call of nature.</i> The urinating tapered off, then stopped. Footsteps began padding down the trail. Twenty feet away, Driscoll estimated, around the bend.</p><p>Moments later a figure appeared on the trail. His gait was unhurried, almost lazy. In the night vision Driscoll could see an AK-47 slung over his shoulder, barrel down. The guard kept coming. Driscoll didn&#x2019;t move. Fifteen feet . . . ten.</p><p>A figure rose up from the shadows along the trail and slipped in behind the guard. A hand appeared over the guard&#x2019;s shoulder, then the flash of a blade came over the other shoulder. Collins twisted the man to the right and down to the ground, and their shadows melted together. Ten seconds passed. Collins rose, ducked off the trail, and dragged the guard out of sight.</p><p><i>Textbook sentry takedown,</i> Driscoll thought. Movie portrayals aside, knifework was something of a rarity in their business. Even so, Collins clearly hadn&#x2019;t lost the skill.</p><p>Moments later Collins reappeared on Driscoll&#x2019;s right.</p><p>Driscoll returned his attention to the sentry on the ridge. Still there. Hadn&#x2019;t moved at all. Driscoll brought his M4 up, settled the sights on the nape of the man&#x2019;s neck, and then tightened his finger on the trigger.</p><p><i>Easy, easy . . . squeeze ...</i></p><p><i>Pop.</i> Not much of a sound. Hard to hear at all at a range of more than fifty meters, but the bullet flew true and transited the target&#x2019;s head, leaving a puff of green vapor behind, and he went off to see Allah, or whatever god he acknowledged; at twentyodd years old, growing and eating and learning, and probably fighting, came to an abrupt and unwarned end.</p><p>The target crumpled, folding sideways out of sight.</p><p><i>Tough luck, Gomer,</i> Driscoll thought. <i>But we&#x2019;re after bigger game than you tonight.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sentry down,&#x201d; Driscoll said quietly into his radio. &#x201c;The ridgeline is clear. Move on up. Keep it nice and tight.&#x201d; That last bit wasn&#x2019;t really necessary&#x2014;not with these guys.</p><p>He looked back to see his men moving a little faster now. They were excited but under control, ready to get down to business. He could see it in their postures, the economy of movement that separated real shooters from wannabees and in-and-outers who were just waiting to return to civilian life.</p><p>Their real target might be less than a hundred meters away now, and they&#x2019;d worked hard over the previous three months to bag this bastard. Mountain climbing was not anyone&#x2019;s idea of fun, except for maybe those nutjobs who pined after Everest and K2. Be that as it may, this was part of the job, and part of their current mission, so everybody sucked it up and kept moving.</p><p>The fifteen men formed up in three fire teams of five Rangers each. One would stay here with their heavy weapons&#x2014;they&#x2019;d brought two M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) machine guns for fire cover on overwatch. No telling how many bad guys there might be about, and the SAW was a great equalizer. Satellites could give you only so much intel; some variables you just had to deal with as they came to you. All his men were scanning the rocks, looking for movement. Any movement. Maybe just a bad guy who came out to take a dump. In this neck of the woods, there was a ninety percent chance that anybody you encountered was a bad guy. Made their job that much easier, Driscoll thought.</p><p>Moving even more slowly now, he stalked forward, eyes flicking from his feet, watching each placement for loose rocks and twigs, then ahead, scanning, scanning.... This was another benefit of wisdom, he thought, knowing how to quash the excitement of being so close to the goal line. This is often where rookies and dead men made their mistakes, thinking the hard part was behind them and their target was so close. And that, Driscoll knew, is when Old Man Murphy, of Murphy&#x2019;s Law fame, usually snuck up behind you, tapped you on the shoulder, and handed you an ugly surprise. Anticipation and expectation were lethal sides of the same coin. Either one in the right dose at the wrong moment would get you killed.</p><p><i>Not this time, though. Not on my damned watch.</i> And not with a team as good as his.</p><p>Driscoll saw the ridgeline looming ahead not more than ten feet away, and he hunched over, careful to keep his head below the lip, lest he present a tantalizing silhouette target for some alert gomer. He covered the last few feet on flat feet, then leaned forward, left hand flat against the rock, and peeked his head up.</p><p>And there you are . . . The cave.</p></p><h2>The Heart: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>One of Bill Gates' "Five Best Summer Reads"</b></p><p><b>The basis for the critically-acclaimed film, <i>Heal the Living</i>, directed by </b><b>Katell </b><b>Quill�v�r� and starring Tahar Rahim and Emmanuelle Seigner</b></p><p><b>Albertine Prize Finalist</b></p><p><b>Winner of the </b><b>Wellcome Book Prize and the </b><b>French-American Foundation Translation Prize</b></p><p>Just before dawn on a Sunday morning, three teenage boys go surfing.

There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One</i><br>It was raining by the time we reached the railroad bridge. Evening was coming on, and the pelting rain was cold.<br><br>We dug in our heels and slid down the embankment to get under the bridge, where there was shelter of a sort. We built a fire, then huddled over it wondering what had become of our summer's wages.<br><br>Three of us were there, strangers until a few hours ago, now joined in the idea of going west. I'd be going home, or to as much of a home as I could lay claim to, being rootless as a tumbleweed, blowing on, resting here and there against this fence or that, but staying nowhere long. As for the others, I had no idea.<br><br>The black skeleton frame of the trestle danced in the wavering light from the fire, and from time to time the flames guttered and hissed as the wind blew down the draw, spattering us with cold drops from off the bridge.<br><br>Rustling around for wood reminded me of a winter I spent in Montana one time . . . at the Hartman &amp; Liggett horse camp. No snow on the ground all winter long, only flurries from time to time, but cold. The ice froze rock-hard on the creek that year, and never broke until late spring.<br><br>Taking all in all, that had been a good winter. The cabin was snug against the wind, the pot-bellied stove gave off almost too much heat, and there were old magazines and a couple of books lying around.<br><br>When not in a mind to read, I'd sit and ponder. Whilst only a youngster I had taken to rebuilding places in my mind, places I'd lived in or seen, and when I'd nothing else to do I would put a place together, every single thing in place, then bit by bit I'd recall the folks I'd known there and what was said--what we talked about, and the like. It gave me something to do, but no great respect for the high art of conversational talk.<br><br>When a man sets out to recall in detail as I did, he sets more to working than he's figured on, for he never looks at anything after that without thinking how he'll recall it in time to come. It also sets a man to thinking about himself, and when a man stands himself up to ponder at, he can't always be pleased at what he sees.<br><br>No working cowhand is going to get very far unless he's a hand to notice. Punching cows takes you over a lot of rough country, and pretty soon you get to know every draw, hill, or clump of brush. You notice the game trails and the springs, and where the cattle go for shelter, and a lot more besides. A man has to notice or he won't get very far at punching cows.<br><br>Back there at the Hartman &amp; Liggett horse camp there'd always been a brown crock of baked beans, and I'd never had my fill of beans. Sitting there beside that hateful fire under the trestle with night coming on, I kept thinking back to that horse camp and those crocks of beans. They would be tasty, mighty tasty, right now.<br><br>That big colored boy, he looked at me and he said, "You look like you been in a fight."<br><br>"Here an' there," I said.<br><br>"You fight with the mitts?"<br><br>"Nobody ever showed me. I just fight the best way I know how."<br><br>"I've boxed," he said.<br><br>He was a big boy, maybe a year or two older than my twenty-six years, standing around six feet, and built strong. And he had good hands.<br><br>That was the first thing he said about me. "You got good hands." He doubled up my fist. "Flat across the knuckles. Stands shock better. You could punch, I think."<br><br>Puttering around, I fetched back a few more sticks. A branch or two, a few old sticks and such-like--anything to keep the fire going.<br><br>"When did you say that freight was due?" Van Bokkelen asked.<br><br>"Ten-twelve, if it's on time."<br><br>Van Bokkelen was a big blond man, raw-boned and with an uncurried look--shaggy hair and a broad, tough face, yet not bad-looking. He had small, ice-blue eyes, no more warmth in them than in the head of a nail.<br><br>Twelve hours before no one of us had known the others. We'd come together in jail, in the drunk tank. Only I'd been pulled in for fighting, and it wasn't the first time. Seemed like I was always being arrested for fighting. Not that I knew much about it, but I just naturally liked to fight.<br><br>The wind blew cold. Rain spattered over us, and I hitched the collar of my cloth suit-coat higher around my ears and stretched my hands toward the flames.<br><br>We were sheltered in part by a bank of drift sand; on our left ran a small stream. The rain was falling harder now, the gusts were more frequent.<br><br>"You got a place?" Eddie Holt, the colored boy, asked. "I mean, you got a place to go to?"<br><br>"I got no place, and never had no place except west." With a gesture I indicated my sacked-up saddle. "My home's been in the middle of that."<br><br>"You got to have a horse."<br><br>"You think so, do you? Sometimes I figure I've packed that saddle damn near as far as I've rode horses."<br><br>"I'd be damned if I'd pack it," Van Bokkelen said. "I'd steal a horse before I'd do that."<br><br>"It's been done," I admitted, not wanting to argue principle with a stranger over a friendly fire.<br><br>We listened to the rain, and hopefully listened for a train whistle, but it was a long while until train time and I was hungry as a springtime bear fresh out of hibernation.<br><br>"Maybe I could get me a riding job," Eddie suggested.<br><br>"There was a colored boy rode for an outfit I worked for down New Mexico way. He was a good hand. Can you ride?"<br><br>"I never rode for no cow outfit, but I rode in a Buffalo Bill show." He grinned at me. "I was an Indian."<br><br>"You ain't the first," I said, and then added, "They tell me you really got to ride for Cody."<br><br>"I can ride. I can rope a little. But I never rode for no cow outfit."<br><br>"A man who can't live without working," Van Bokkelen scoffed, "is a fool. I'd see myself in hell before I'd eat dust behind a bunch of cows."<br><br>Well, I sat quiet, feeling the Old Ned coming up in me. All my life I've punched cows or worked hard for what little I'd had, and I didn't cotton to this stranger making me out a fool. Come to think of it, he didn't seem to be doing so well.<br><br>Eddie Holt, he sat quiet, too, and never said aye, yes, or no, and that seemed to be a good idea. This blond gent was a whole lot bigger than me, and my ribs and jaw were still sore from my last fight.<br><br>"You do what you're of a mind to," I said after a minute. "I'll punch cows."<br><br>"For thirty a month?" he sneered. "You boys come along with me and you'll be wearin' silk shirts and broadcloth. I could use two men like you."<br><br>Back up the line I heard a footstep splash in the water. "Somebody comin'," I said, and turned my head to look. When I looked back Van Bokkelen was gone.<br><br>"Sit close," Eddie warned. "It's the Law."<br><br>It sure was. There were four of them, four big men wearing slickers and armed with shotguns. They had spread out as they came up to the fire and they looked from one to the other of us.<br><br>"You!" The man I knew as the sheriff gestured with his shotgun. "Stand up!" He came up to me. "You armed?"<br><br>"I owned a Winchester one time," I said. "Never had no use for a hand gun."<br><br>He went over me with as smooth and knowing a frisk as ever I got, then did the same for Eddie.<br>"You haven't even got a knife? Or a razor?"<br><br>Eddie lifted his big hands. "Never had use for anything but these," he said.<br><br>The sheriff looked around at a narrow-faced, red-haired man. "Didn't you say there were three of them? You had three of them, you said."<br><br>"That's right. They didn't come together, but they left together. The black boy there, he was straight vag. Loafing around, no visible means of support. We gave him overnight in jail and a floater.<br><br>"The one in the broad hat, he got into a fight with Salty Breakenridge over to Ryan's. They busted up the place."<br><br>The sheriff looked at me with respect. "With Salty? I saw him. I figured it had to be a bigger man than you. What do you weigh, puncher?"<br><br>"Hundred and seventy," I said. "I never seen size makes too much difference." Then kind of grudgingly I had to acknowledge, "Although that there Salty . . . I'd say he was a fair hand."<br><br>The sheriff chuckled. "Yes, I'd say that. Nobody ever whipped him before."<br><br>He kicked the sack containing my gear. "What's in that?"<br><br>"Saddle. I'm headed west."<br><br>"How'd you come east? Trainload of cattle?"<br><br>"Uh-huh."<br><br>The quiet man with the gray eyes had said nothing up to then, but he had been looking around. "Where's the other one?" he asked. "The big blond man?"<br><br>"Ain't seen him," I said, "only once since we left jail. He was headin' for Ryan's and a drink." I grinned at them. "I figured I'd no business goin' back there."<br><br>They just looked at me, and then the quiet man said, "Don't cover for him, boys. He isn't worth it. That's a bad man."<br><br>"I wouldn't know," I said, "but you had him in jail--why didn't you keep him?"<br><br>The sheriff spat. "Because we didn't know who he was. Like damn fools we let him go. Then Fargo here, he got to thinking about an old reward poster. There's a reward on that man . . . dead or alive. He's wanted for murder."<br><br>Eddie, he never even looked at me.<br><br>"How much?" I said, for I was curious.<br><br>"Five thousand."<br>Hell, I never seen that much money in my whole lifetime. You don't see much, working for thirty a month and found. It was a lucky thing when I put forty saved dollars into a saddle.<br><br>Fargo looked at me. "What's your name, cowpuncher?"<br><br>"Pike," I said, "Barnabas Pike. Some places they call me Pronto."<br><br>"Pronto? Because you're fast?"<br><br>Me, I grinned at him. "Maybe because I swing too quick," I said. "I got a mean temper when I'm riled, but it ain't always that. I never had much fun . . . except fightin'."<br><br>"I can believe it," the sheriff said. "I saw Salty Breakenridge after."<br><br>They poked around a little, stared off down the stream bed, and then they started off. Only Fargo lingered. He kicked at the ground where Van Bokkelen had sat. "Five thousand," he said, "is a lot of money."<br><br>"Mister," I said, "I seen that gent in jail and I didn't cotton to him, but I never sold anybody out yet, and I ain't about to start."<br><br>"I thought you'd be that way," Fargo said quietly, "but don't tangle with that man. You leave him alone, cowpuncher. He's bad medicine."<br><br>"You been west," I said.<br><br>"A time or two," he said. "And maybe again."<br><br>Then he walked off after the others, and we said nothing, Eddie Holt and me, watching them go.<br><br>Finally Eddie picked up sticks and added them to the fire. "Murder," he said--"that's bad. I wonder who he killed?"<br><br>"He's full of mean," I said. "I could see it in him."<br><br>I looked at Eddie. "You goin' any place particular? If you ain't, come along with me. Two can starve as free as one, and if I get a ridin' job I'll speak for you."<br><br>"I take that kindly," he said.<br><br>The fire was warm; the wind had gone down and the rain had about stopped. There was still the sound of the big drops falling off the trestle.<br><br>A long time we sat quiet, and me wishing I could catch some shut-eye, but little time remained if we were going to catch that drag. I kept squatting there thinking about how I wished there'd be an empty on that train. I'd never liked riding freights unless there was an empty.<br><br>"We're partners, Pronto?" Eddie said.<br><br>"Why not?" I said, and then the train whistled far off.<br><br>We got up and Eddie kicked out the fire mostly, and then scooped water from the creek with an old can and poured it over what was left to put it out. Then we struggled up to the trestle together.<br><br>The train slowed up along here, with a good grade ahead, and a man could take it moving.<br><br>"Can you make it? Totin' that saddle?"<br><br>"You watch me."<br><br>We let a dozen cars go by, and then Eddie saw an open door as it passed a red light on a switch, and called out to me. He was a fast man, making the run easy and swinging up, and he caught my saddle as I swung it at the opening. Me, I caught the edge of the floor and hauled myself up, the ground slipping away behind me.<br><br>Long after Eddie had rolled up in some paper he found at one end of the car, I sat there by the open door, a-looking out at the country. Here and there we flipped past lonely farms with lights in the windows . . . one time there was a man walking to-ward the house with a lantern and a milk pail, and a dog barking at the train.<br><br>"Dirt farmers," I sneered. "Home guards!" But away down inside I wasn't sneering at all. That man was going into his own house to set down to his supper at his own table, with his kinfolk around him.<br><br>And me? All I had was a lonesome whistle sound as the train bent around a curve, the distant glow of the firebox, and somewhere down the line a flea-bitten cow pony, and a chuck wagon for home.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br></i><br>When I woke up it was daylight and the train was bumping along at a good pace. Walking to the door, I could see patches of woods, a stream and miles of wheat fields slipping by.<br><br>Eddie sat up. "That right, what you said? We're partners?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"Where all we goin'?"<br><br>"West . . . I dunno. Maybe Miles City . . . Medora. First place that looks likely."<br><br>"I could eat. Boy, but I could eat!"<br><br>"You an' me," I said.<br><br>"You been punchin' cows a long time?"</p><h2>JPS Hebrew-English TANAKH: Cloth Edition</h2><p><p>Read our customer guide</p><p>Bound in navy leatherette with gilded edges and navy satin ribbon; padded binding.</p><p>The <i>JPS Hebrew-English TANAKH</i> features the oldest-known complete Hebrew version of the Holy Scriptures, side by side with JPS&#x2019;s renowned English translation.

My first attack left me laid out -- in fetal position -- sobbing like Toni Braxton in the "Unbreak My Heart" video. One of my best friends in the world stood close by in helpless, empathetic silence. She was visibly shaken by her futile attempts to console me -- and wholly afraid of leaving me alone. The sudden banging on my front door provided a temporary distraction.</p><p>"Joan!! JOAN!!" the voice hollered. "Are you okay? Let me in!!"</p><p><i>Who the..?</i> Slowly it registered through my delirium. <i>Damn.</i> It was Dude. The one I'd been sleeping with (but not the one I liked). The one I'd warned repeatedly that there was no reason on God's green earth ever good enough to make surprise appearances at my door. The one (if I'd been a better person at the time) I woulda cut off months before, when I first realized the imbalance in our levels of affection. But among his many nocturnal delights was an insatiable seafood jones -- we're talking won't stop eating 'til <i>you</i> get enough -- and unfortunately, it thwarted any attempts at altruism.</p><p>Like an angel of mercy my girl's svelte but muscular 5'11" frame staunchly barricaded the apartment door. "I must've called when whatever it is was all going down," he tried to explain. "I know she doesn't like people to just drop by, but she sounded so fucked-up."</p><p>"Yes, something's happened but you can't see her right now," my homey says kindly but with unchallengeable resolve. She knew his worries were sweet but useless. He's not the one I like (the one I wasn't sleeping with). He's not calling to say, "It was all a lie. I do not have a girl at home that's six months pregnant -- a fact I've neglected to mention for at least the last five." He's not the one who hurt me.</p><p>"Yes, she'll be alright," she assures him, while gently guiding him outside. "But she's in no condition to talk right now. <i>To anybody."</i></p><p>She returns to the couch and rubs my back soothingly. Slowly, the tenderness of her caress converts my wailing to a soft, steady whimper. It doesn't, however, mask her confusion. And I am of no assistance. For the life of me, I can't tell her why her girl, someone whose response to severe emotional hurt is usually of the "Find him. Go to his home, office, gym, whatever, and scream, holler, and throw things, but whatever you do -- fight" variety is lying catatonic on the sofa, teetering dangerously close to the abyss.</p><p>Mercifully, the only soul capable of doing me any earthly good calls unexpectedly. Carefully, gently she pulls me back from the precipice.</p><p><i>Bethann,</i> I sniffle. <i>I just feel so stupid.</i></p><p>"Stop it now. 'Cuz feelings are what they are, and we ain't gonna judge feelings."</p><p><i>I can't believe I let myself be played like that.</i></p><p>"It doesn't mean none of that, baby. This doesn't mean he doesn't care. It just means he didn't know how to tell you."</p><p><i>He's a fucking dick.</i></p><p>"Right now. Yes. And maybe tomorrow. But after a while you're going to have to let yourself remember the magic of him. Or this will eat you up inside."</p><p><i>I hurt, BA.</i></p><p>"Of course you do, baby. And believe it or not he does too. Nobody 'cept the devil could want to know he's tearing you up this bad inside."</p><p>The wisdom in this starts me blubbering again, and this time for a really, really long time. BA just listens. She doesn't even mention what I already know. That at some point we're going to have to talk about <i>my</i> responsibility in all this. 'Cuz even though this fool screwed up royally, I was grown enough to know that all the "Gwanna leaves" in the world don't alter this fact: Until the day he really broke clean he was always somebody else's. She does remind me that given the circumstances there was no other way for it to end -- whether he'd been honest with me or not. The Joan she knows would never want a man who could turn his back on his pregnant babymother to go start something else. Of course this makes me feel better and then, simultaneously worse, because one of the things I love most about this man is his loyalty and sense of honor.</p><p>But mostly BethAnn waits for the epiphany, for me to realize that what I'm suffering from is not a broken heart, but a full-blown case of Chickenhead Envy. And the only cure is for me to confront the sordid, green-eyed source of my pain.</p><p>It was something I could only admit to a woman who loves me like a daughter. I really hadn't spent the last four hours crying because Dude betrayed our friendship and straight-up lied to me. I wasn't even mad that he was sleeping with his woman. I was mad and hurt that she was his woman at all.</p><p>Igniting my fury were the memories of endless conversations about his frustrations with a woman who seemed to have no greater life aspirations than being wifey. He paid her bills. Showered her with shopping sprees at Barneys. Handed over the keys to the Land Cruiser. He just wanted -- correction -- needed her to want something out of life besides him.</p><p>I remembered the pride and interest he took in my work, the way he marveled at my independence and self-sufficiency and the encouragement he provided every time I tentatively shared a new goal. But I also remembered the exasperation in his voice as he confided, "Yo, I tell her all the time, you want to go to school? I'll pay for it. You wanna start a business? I'll finance it, but all this free time on her hands leaves her with too much time to worry about my every move."</p><p>I was mad because there was a black woman out there lucky enough to find a man who offered to financially support her every dream and somehow managed not to have any. I was crying in a sense, not only for me but for all the straight-up wonderful, ambitious, struggling, and single sistas I knew -- women who had dreams and mad love to give but could barely find brothers willing to listen. Sistas who, I knew, if given the opportunity this brother was providing, would give a heartfelt thanks to the Creator -- and then show Him how high they can fly.</p><p>I was crying because an admittedly frightened, weak, vulnerable, but oh so real part of me wanted to yell, <i>"TAKE CARE OF ME. PROTECT ME. BE THERE FOR ME. LOVE ME."</i> Instead, I ended the last conversation we would have for two years by calling him everything but a child of God.</p><p><i>It's not fair, BethAnn. It's just not fair.</i></p><p>"I know, sweetheart. That's why it hurts so much. 'Cuz us smart, good-hearted, independent girls, we're the best. We're out there handling our business and conquering the world, and we manage to be there for them too. We've got their backs. We're the ones they call in the middle of the night. We're like their best friends. The only thing we ask for is for them to be their best. And then it's the weak ones who do the things we wouldn't dream of -- "</p><p><i>Like getting pregnant on purpose.</i></p><p>"Right. Threatening to kill yourself. You know, the things we would never do. And those are the girls who seem to win.</p><p>"But, baby?"</p><p><i>Yes, BethAnn.</i></p><p>"They don't win forever. They really don't. You're young so it seems like that now. But remember, we mature faster than boys. Sometimes it takes the men we love a little longer to realize how much they love us."</p><p>I hung up the phone, hoping to God she was right.</p><p>I hear you, the non-believers, steadily testifying. <i>Not me. Not I. There's nothing I could possibly have in common, let alone envy, about a chickenhead.</i> And for a precious few sista-saints this might actually be true. The rest of you, my dears, are fronting. Not to worry, though. Chickenhead Envy is usually accompanied by intense denial.</p><p>To you I offer my favorite Chickenhead litmus test: a piece of entertainment industry gossip concerning a certain celebrity. Contrary to his image as a family man, rumor has it the brother's been tipping -- albeit discreetly -- on longtime wifey for years. His tipping wasn't hard to fathom -- baby must have more money than God and is 'bout as fine as Jesus. With his megafame, extramarital ass is a given on his menu in just about any country with a working TV. What would wifey's incentive be for turning a blind eye? Maybe a combination of love, being the mother of his children, and landing in the mix pre-fame and without a good pre-nup.</p><p>What I couldn't get was how he would manage to keep his shit so on the low. As the old saying goes, <i>Hell hath no fury like a woman pissed off.</i> In addition to wreaking a little domestic havoc and tarnishing his image, any scorned mistress of his stood to make a bundle confiding the details of her heartbreak to the media.</p><p>So needless to say, when one of my homeboys said he discovered much fewer than six degrees of separation between himself and one of Mr. Mention's alleged mistresses, I was wide open on the details. Word is, according to my boy, he goes through great pains to make silence and loyalty a helluva lot more lucrative than kissing and telling. "All I can tell you is that he treats her very, very well. The car, house, and living expenses are all taken care of -- plus an allowance in six figures a year. And Joan, are you ready for this? She's not the only one."</p><p>The next time I see Mr. Mention on TV all I can think is <i>Damn. Another million for the ho fund.</i> Then I find myself envisioning the lucky chicken chillin' in a new Mercedes SLK Kompressor and discover something else -- envy-green is an unattractive shade for an allegedly righteous black girl. Curious to see other sistas' reactions, I repeated this "what if" scenario.</p><p>The results of my informal poll? With the exception of one admirable saint (and she wasn't me) we all failed to take the high road. The only difference was that girlfriends who were unabashed graduates of "Pussy Ain't Free U" weren't hampered by things like moral quandaries or my womanist drivel. All they wanted to know, in the succinct words of one, was <i>Where are the auditions?</i> My chickenhead-hatin' homegirls, however, did a lot more qualifying.</p><p><i>His wife is cool about it, right? I mean she's gotta know.</i></p><p><i>I wouldn't do it if I was in love.</i></p><p>And my favorite,</p><p><i>I woul...</i></p></p><h2>The Guns of the South: A Novel</h2><p>"It is absolutely unique--without question the most fascinating Civil War novel I have ever read."<br>Professor James M. McPherson<br>Pultizer Prize-winning BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM<br>January 1864--General Robert E. Lee faces defeat. The Army of Northern Virginia is ragged and ill-equpped. Gettysburg has broken the back of the Confederacy and decimated its manpower.<br>Then, Andries Rhoodie, a strange man with an unplaceable accent, approaches Lee with an extraordinary offer. Rhoodie demonstrates an amazing rifle: Its rate of fire is incredible, its lethal efficiency breathtaking--and Rhoodie guarantees unlimited quantitites to the Confederates. <br>The name of the weapon is the AK-47....<br>Selected by the Science Fiction Book Club<br>A Main Selection of the Military Book Club</p><p>With the power and assurance of a master storyteller and the scrupulous accuracy of a trained historian, Harry Turtledove has created an immense, meticulously detailed, and utterly plausible world in which history takes a most unexpected turn. In The Guns of the South, Turtledove takes one of the most dramatic, bloody, and tumultuous episodes in our life as a nation, the Civil War, and vividly imagines what might have been had the rebels prevailed. In the unusually cold winter of 1864, General Robert E. Lee finds himself and his Army of Northern Virginia huddled on the banks of the Rapidan, trying to fight a war despite meager rations and a terrible lack of equipment - indeed, some of his men do not even have shoes. But when Lee finds a way to arm his forces, the tide suddenly turns; the rebels win a decisive victory at the Battle of Wilderness. Lee presses his advantage, marching on Washington. But if Lincoln surrenders, and the Confederacy can negotiate independence from the Union, there remain many obstacles to peace. The disputed states of Kentucky and Missouri must be accommodated. And the matter of slavery itself will threaten the newly independent Confederate States with fresh factional strife. Indeed, with victory come difficult choices for Robert E. Lee. War has worn down his health. His invalid wife lives for the day the two of them can finally build a peaceful life together. His days of service should be drawing to a close. Yet set against Lee&#39;s personal desires is the prospect of watching his beloved land squander the freedom that he and his men fought so desperately to win. Not for his own ambition but because duty calls, Lee will find himself faced with the price oftriumph. Mixing masterfully drawn historical and fictional characters, Turtledove brings to life the turmoil of a people in crisis. Here are the details of what it was like to fight in a Confederate army transformed from ragged to victorious: letters written home on scraps of wallpaper, &#34;coffee&#34; brewed from chicory and burnt grain, the fiery Battle of Wilderness, the march into Washington City and the confrontation with Lincoln, the negotiations between the United States and the Confederate States of America. Turtledove also takes us into conversations between General Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis and fascinating exchanges between Lee and Grant in their roles as keepers of the peace in a land divided. A highly original and extraordinary vision of history as it both was and could have been, The Guns of the South will take its place alongside the most exciting historical fiction ever written about the War Between the States.<b>Harry Turtledove</b> is the award-winning author of the alternate-history works <i>The Man with the Iron Heart, The Guns of the South, </i>and <i>How Few Remain</i> (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel); the Hot War books (<i>Bombs Away, Fallout, </i>and<i> Armistice</i>); the War That Came Early novels: <i>Hitler&#x2019;s War, West and East, The Big Switch,</i> <i>Coup d&#x2019;Etat, Two Fronts, </i>and<i> Last Orders; </i>the Worldwar saga: <i>In the Balance, Tilting the Balance, Upsetting the Balance,</i> and<i> Striking the Balance;</i> the Colonization books: <i>Second Contact, Down to Earth,</i> and<i> Aftershocks; </i>the Great War epics: <i>American Front, Walk in Hell,</i> and <i>Breakthroughs;</i> the American Empire novels: <i>Blood and Iron, The Center Cannot Hold, </i>and <i>Victorious Opposition;</i> and the Settling Accounts series: <i>Return Engagement, Drive to the East, The Grapple, </i>and<i> In at the Death</i>.

Two remarkable talents, New York Times best-sellers Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, have risked everything to bring this remarkable account to light. Five books -- one thrilling adventure -- the Spiderwick Chronicles! <br> Their world is closer than you think.</p><p>Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi pull off an impressive five for five with <i>Wrath of Mulgarath</i>, the satisfyingly dramatic conclusion to their series, The Spiderwick Chronicles. After the gory conclusion of the <i>The Ironwood Tree</i>, we don't get even a moment's reprieve before the action picks up again, in a starting chapter entitled, fittingly, "IN WHICH the World Is Turned Upside Down." Thirteen-year-old Mallory and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon return to the Spiderwick Estate only to find their home in shambles, with trash and broken furniture scattered across the lawn and Simon's griffin chasing a "goblin" across the roof. The faerie world that the Grace kids have so slowly probed in this series has finally come home to roost. Black and DiTerlizzi pack a lot into the finale of this beautifully produced series, with dragons and goblins and elves--and even a magical cameo by Arthur Spiderwick (the long-lost author of the disappearing-reappearing <i>Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You</i>). We get a dramatic rescue, a clever end to a fearsome foe (with some thanks to Hogsqueal from <i>book two</i>), and a long denouement that leads to a final cryptic note from the author and illustrator: "Are there more ogres / and dragons to slay? / Is there more mayhem, / perhaps, on the way? / Ask Tony and Holly. / They'll swear that it's true. / But you still won't believe / what's coming for you!" <i>(Ages 6 to 10) --Paul Hughes</i>The fifth and final book in the first Spiderwick series! <p>Through field, cave, and forest <br>this tale has been spun. <br>And three must now finish <br>what malice has begun. </p><p>One will bear sword, <br>and one will rule sky, <br>but one has the answer <br>hidden deep down inside -- </p><p>an answer for anger, <br>a balm against rage, <br>freedom for a captive, <br>and the cure for a sage. </p><p>See who is standing <br>when you turn the last page.</p></p><h2>Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli (English, Russian and Greek Edition)</h2><p><p>This spiritual classic was written by Lorenzo Scupoli, a sixteenth-century Venetian priest. Immensely popular in its own day, it was ranked by Francis de Sales with the Imitation of Christ.

Covering every disorder routinely encountered in clinical practice, Allen Frances provides the ICD-9-CM codes and (where feasible) ICD-10-CM codes required for billing, a useful screening question, a descriptive prototype, diagnostic tips, and other disorders that must be ruled out. Frances was instrumental in the development of past editions of DSM and provides helpful cautions on questionable aspects of DSM-5. An index of common presenting symptoms lists possible diagnoses that must be considered for each. The Appendix (which can also be accessed at the companion website) features a Crosswalk to ICD-10-CM codes.</p><p><p> Allen Frances, MD, is a clinician, educator, researcher, and leading authority on psychiatric diagnosis. He chaired the DSM-IV Task Force, was a member of the Task Force that prepared DSM-III-R, and wrote the final version of the Personality Disorders section in DSM-III. The author of several hundred papers and more than a dozen books, most recently<i> Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life</i>, Dr. Frances is Professor Emeritus and former Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University.</p><br><p> "<i>Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis</i> is simply the best book I&#x2019;ve read about how to accurately diagnose your patients. Frances's combination of vast experience, down-in-the-trenches common sense, and informed skepticism is unique. Whether you&#x2019;re a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, nurse, crisis counselor, or any other mental health professional, you should buy this book, read it cover to cover initially, and then keep it in your office to refer back to frequently. I&#x2019;m glad this book had not been published before I wrote my book on the psychiatric interview, because the competition would have made me choose a different topic!"--Daniel J. Carlat, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Tufts University School of Medicine; Founding Editor, <i>The Carlat Psychiatry Report</i><br><br> "With his clinical expertise, leadership roles in prior DSM editions, and healthy skepticism about overdiagnosis and excessive medication, Frances has crafted a clinical gem. This clear and concise book describes a sequential assessment process and provides screening questions, easily remembered prototypic descriptions, differential diagnostic considerations, and cautionary notes about diagnostic traps. Frances recognizes the need for a diagnosis to guide intervention, while steering clear of diagnostic reification. All clinicians need this book for frequent reference, and it should be a required text in mental health training programs."--John F. Clarkin, PhD, Personality Disorders Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College<br><br> "This easy-to-read, commonsensical handbook guides mental health clinicians through the thicket of differential diagnosis in psychiatry. Frances--a thoughtful and effective critic of the excesses of DSM-5--shows where diagnosis is valid and essential, and where a premature diagnosis or a diagnostic fad has the potential to hurt patients. Everyone who uses diagnosis in daily practice will benefit from the down-to-earth wisdom of this book."--Joel Paris, MD, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Canada&nbsp;<br><br>"A 'must have' for mental health professionals. Frances provides useful, easy-to-understand information about psychiatric diagnosis and coding for clinicians in all mental health disciplines."--K. Dayle Jones, PhD, LMHC, Mental Health Counseling Program, University of Central Florida<br><br> "Frances demonstrates an unusual ability to communicate the tacit knowledge of an expert into understandable concepts and ideas that will be appreciated by clinicians and students alike. Elegantly simple screening questions precede each disorder and cut through the diagnostic murk. Facilitating patient-centered care, teamwork, and collaboration, this is a comprehensive diagnostic resource for the whole treatment team."--Margaret (Peggy) Halter, PhD, APRN, Editor, <i>Foundations of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing;</i> Associate Dean, Dwight Schar College of Nursing and Health Sciences, Ashland University<br><br> "This volume should head the list of user-friendly guides to psychiatric diagnosis. Frances draws on his considerable experience and contributions, such as heading the DSM-IV Task Force, to produce a work that will be indispensable for primary care clinicians and all professionals and students in mental health care. The guide contains screening questions, prototypic case descriptions, ICD-9-CM codes (and ICD-10-CM codes where feasible), and specific cautionary statements to reduce diagnostic inflation and raise concerns about aspects of DSM-5. The material is handled with sensitivity and compassion, with the patient's best interests always the central consideration. This book is a welcome arrival at a time when recent trends in diagnosis are increasingly attracting controversy. I will be using this excellent guide in my own work and will recommend it to my students and colleagues."--Adrian Wells, PhD, Division of Clinical Psychology, University of Manchester, United Kingdom<br><br> "Anyone who brings a critical perspective to psychiatric diagnosis will welcome this book's truly refreshing, reader-friendly approach. Frances, a well-known, respected psychiatrist, offers up what is clearly a lifetime synthesis of wisdom and knowledge on diagnosis. Rejecting the cumbersome detailing of esoteric diagnostic criteria found elsewhere, Frances presents a simpler, consumable structure for readers. Importantly, he includes specific DSM-5-related cautions and caveats. Social workers will appreciate that Frances begins discussion of the diagnostic interview with a section called 'The Relationship Comes First'--and that he argues the client should actually be part of the diagnostic team. This is good stuff."--Kia J. Bentley, PhD, LCSW, School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University</p><p>"This uncluttered, visually appealing guide will assist all primary care physicians in the care of patients with psychiatric illnesses."--Elizabeth S. White, MD, internist, Settlement Health, New York City<br><br> "I selected this book as a required text in my master's-level course on the DSM. This is the best companion to the DSM that I have found since I began teaching this course. Many of my students have limited experience with psychiatric assessment and diagnosis, and find the DSM overwhelming and off-putting. Frances provides the perfect counterbalance to DSM-5 orthodoxy. His book is filled with clinical practice wisdom that will benefit students in their day-to-day work with clients. I expect that this will be one of the books that students keep on their shelves well after graduation as they work in the field. Social workers are the largest provider group of mental health care; this user-friendly resource will help them develop the skills they need to accurately assess and diagnose."--Mark J. Brenner, PhD, ACSW, LICSW, Professor and Graduate Program Coordinator, School of Social Work, Bridgewater State University</p><br><br><br> "[This work] represents the kind of valuable clinical wisdom that one accumulates after years of diagnostic experience....Clinical pearls focus in particular on the fuzzy boundaries and grey areas between threshold diagnoses and non-diagnostic problems of living, as well as Dr. Frances's concerns about diagnostic inflation in psychiatry.", <i>Psychiatric Times</i> Published On: 2013-08-15<br><br>&#x201c;The book is for anyone interested in psychiatric diagnosis, and the author specifically mentions that the book will assist busy primary care doctors to be directed toward an accurate diagnosis.

It is concise and readable. It adds clinical insight coupled with many years of experience to the somewhat dry task of explaining all of the currently &#x2018;in vogue&#x2019; criteria defining mental illnesses. Frances is forthcoming and candid. Where he sees common sense being utilized, he provides praise. Where he believes steps have been taken that are questionable, he clearly provides his input. While one would like to believe that there are no politics in diagnosis, this book puts that conception to rest. Frances has succeeded in his goals. He has taken the very difficult task of &#x2018;shrinking&#x2019; the DSM-5 into a focused and readable commentary and explanation. He also provides the corresponding ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease) codes that are parallel to the DSM....For many, when faced with the choice between buying the DSM-5 from the American Psychiatric Association or buying Frances&#x2019;s version, buying this book may be a realistic and, no doubt, less expensive alternative.&#x201d;, <i>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</i> Published On: 2013-01-04</p><h2>The Role of Pastors and Christians in Civil Government</h2><p>How should a Christian contribute to public affairs?

"And yet, it was a life that I found too constricting to continue. And one that I ultimately had to leave." Trained to become a geisha from the age of five, Iwasaki would live among the other "women of art" in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district and practice the ancient customs of Japanese entertainment. She was loved by kings, princes, military heroes, and wealthy statesmen alike. But even though she became one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, Iwasaki wanted more: her own life. And by the time she retired at age twenty-nine, Iwasaki was finally on her way toward a new beginning.<br> <br><i>Geisha, a Life</i> is her story -- at times heartbreaking, always awe-inspiring, and totally true.</p><p>Now in her 50s, Mineko Iwasaki was one of the most famed geishas of her generation (and the chief informant for Arthur Golden's <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>). Her ascent was difficult, not merely because of the hard, endless training she had to undergo--learning how to speak a hyper-elevated dialect of Japanese and how to sing and dance gracefully while wearing a 44-pound kimono atop six-inch wooden sandals--but also because many of the elaborate, self-effacing rules of the art went against her grain. A geisha "is an exquisite willow tree who bends to the service of others," she writes. "I have always been stubborn and contrary. And very, very proud." And playful, too: one of the funniest moments in this bittersweet book describes a disastrous encounter with the queen of England and her all-too-interested husband.<p> Revealing the secrets of the geisha's "art of perfection," this graceful memoir documents a disappearing world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Born in 1949, <b>Mineko Iwasaki</b> was Japan's star geisha until she retired at the age of twenty-nine.

He lives in Scotland.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><b>THE CLOTHES OF OTHERS </b><br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe, owner of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency (as featured in a two-page article in the <i>Botswana Daily News, </i>under the headline: A Lady Who Definitely Knows How to Find Things Out), had strong views on the things that she owned. Personal pos�sessions, she thought, should be simple, well made and not too expensive. Mma Ramotswe was generous in all those circumstances where generosity was required&#x2014;but she was never keen to pay one hundred pula for something that could be obtained elsewhere for eighty pula, or to get rid of any item that, although getting on a bit, still served its purpose well enough. And that, she thought, was the most important consideration of all&#x2014;whether something worked. A possession did not have to be fashionable; it did not have to be the very latest thing; what mattered was that it did what it was supposed to do, and did this in the way expected of it. In that respect, there was not much difference between things and people: what she looked for in people was the quality of doing what they were meant to do, and doing it without too much fuss, noise or complaint. She also felt that if something was doing its job then you should hold on to it and cherish it, rather than discarding it in favour of something new. Her white van, for instance, was now rather old and inclined to rattle, but it never failed to start&#x2014;except after a rain storm, which was rare enough in a dry country like Botswana&#x2014;and it got her from place to place&#x2014;except when she ran out of fuel, or when it broke down, which it did from time to time, but not too often.<br>&nbsp;<br>She applied the same philosophy to her shoes and clothing. It was true that she was always trying to persuade her husband, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, to get rid of his old shirts and jackets, but that was because he, like all men, or certainly the majority of men, tended to hold on to his clothes for far too long. His shoes were an example of that failing: he usually extracted at least four years&#x2019; service out of his oil-stained working boots, his <i>veldschoen. </i>He recognised her dis�taste for these shoes by removing them when he came back from the garage each evening, but he was adamant that any other footwear, including the new waterproof oil- resistant work boots he had seen featured in a mail order catalogue, would be a pointless extravagance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is no point in having fancy boots if you&#x2019;re a mechanic,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What you need is boots that you know will always be there.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But new boots would also always be there,&#x201d; she pointed out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if they would march off by themselves.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni laughed. &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think shoes would be that disobedient,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What I mean is that you want shoes that you know&#x2014;that you trust. I have always liked those boots. They are the ones I&#x2019;ve always worn. I know my way around them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked puzzled. &#x201c;But surely there&#x2019;s not much to know about shoes,&#x201d; she argued. &#x201c;All you have to know is which way round they go. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to put them on back to front, nor put the left shoe on the right foot. But is there much to know beyond that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The conversation went nowhere, as it always did when this subject was raised, and Mma Ramotswe had come to accept that men&#x2019;s clothing was a lost cause. There might be a small number of men who were conscious of their apparel and did not hold on to old shoes and clothes for too long, but if there were, then she certainly was not married to one of them. Her own clothes were a quite different matter, of course. She did not spend an excessive amount on dresses, or on shoes for that matter, but she believed in quality and would never buy cheap clothes for the sake of saving a few pula. What she wanted from her clothes was the ability to stand up to the normal demands of the working day, easy laundering, and, if at all possible, light ironing qualities. If clothes had that, then it did not matter if they were not of the latest style or were of a colour that had ceased to be fashionable. If Mma Ramotswe was comfortable in them, and if they responded to the structural challenges posed by the tradition�ally built figure, then she embraced them enthusiastically, and they, in their way, reciprocated&#x2014;particularly with those parts of her figure that needed support.<br>&nbsp;<br>Given this attitude to the functionality of clothes, it was no sur�prise that she and her erstwhile assistant, now her co-director, Mma Grace Makutsi, wife of Mr. Phuti Radiphuti of the Double Comfort Furniture Store, should not see eye to eye on fashion matters. When she had first started at the agency, Mma Makutsi had not been in a position to spend much money on clothing. In fact, she could spend <i>no </i>money on clothes, for the simple reason that she had none. What savings Mma Makutsi and her family had were committed almost entirely to the fees she had to pay the Botswana Secretarial College, leaving very little for anything else. Then, when she was given the job at the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe had been unable to pay her much of a salary, as the truth of the matter was that the agency&#x2019;s minuscule profits did not really justify the employment of any staff. <br>&nbsp;<br>But Mma Makutsi had talked herself into the job and had been prepared to accept the tiny salary on the grounds that in the fullness of time things would surely look up. They did, and when she found she had a bit of money in her pocket&#x2014;although not all that much&#x2014;she spent at least some of it on replacements for her two increasingly worn dresses. She also splashed out on some new shoes&#x2014;a hand�some pair of court shoes with green leather on the outside and blue lining within. She had never seen anything more beautiful than that pair of shoes, and they had imparted a spring to her step that Mma Ramotswe, and all others dealing with Mma Makutsi, had noticed, even if they did not know to attribute it to new footwear.<br>&nbsp;<br>Following her marriage to Phuti Radiphuti, Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s ward�robe expanded. Phuti was well off, and although he did not believe in flaunting wealth, he was strongly of the view that the wife of a man of his standing, with his herd of over six hundred cattle, should be dressed in a way that was commensurate with her station in life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe had helped Mma Makutsi on that first big spending spree, when they had gone to the Riverwalk shops and pur�chased a dozen dresses, several petticoats, a rail of blouses and, of course, several pairs of new shoes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;d buy all these things,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi had observed apologetically. &#x201c;You know that I am not one of these people who like to wear a different outfit every day&#x2014;you know that, don&#x2019;t you, Mma Ramotswe?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It had seemed to Mma Ramotswe that Mma Makutsi needed reassurance, as we all do from time to time, and she gave it. &#x201c;Nobody would accuse you of being that sort of lady, Mma,&#x201d; she said, as they staggered through under the weight of numerous boxes and bags to Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s tiny white van. &#x201c;I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Phuti, you see,&#x201d; explained Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;He wants me to look smart.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very good,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;It is better to have a husband who knows what you are wearing than to have one who doesn&#x2019;t even notice. Some men never notice, you know. They have no idea what women are wearing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is a great pity for their wives and girlfriends,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;It must be very discouraging to dress up all the time only to find that your husband doesn&#x2019;t even see what you have on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The taste of the two women was similar in some respects&#x2014;but different in others. Their views diverged on shoes, but they both agreed that women should dress modestly and should not wear skirts that were too short. This view was probably shared by the vast major�ity of women in Botswana, even if not by absolutely all of them. Some young women, they had noticed, seemed to have picked up the idea that the more leg a skirt displayed, the more fashionable it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I do not understand that,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;Men know that women have legs&#x2014;that is one of the things that they learn at an early age. So why do you have to show them that you have legs, when they are already well aware of that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe agreed. She might not have put it exactly that way herself, but she shared the general sentiment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was warming to her theme. &#x201c;Of course, I remem�ber the first time I saw really short skirts,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;It was when I came down from Bobonong and I went to enroll at the Botswana Secretarial College. I remember that day very well, Mma.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you do,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;It must have been very different for you, coming from Bobonong and then finding yourself in Gaborone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi stiffened. &#x201c;Why, Mma? Why do you think that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe quickly corrected herself. Mma Makutsi was proud of Bobonong and she would not wish to offend her. One of the things she had learned about human nature was that people tended to be inordinately proud of the place they came from, and that any disparaging remark about that place was hurtful&#x2014;even if it hap�pened to be true. There were some towns&#x2014;indeed some countries&#x2014;that were, by all accounts, difficult places to live; and yet even if everything that was said about them was true, you could not say as much to people who came from such places. What they wanted to hear was that you had heard good reports of their home town or their country, and that one day you hoped you would be able to visit it. That brought smiles of satisfaction and assurances that half of what was said or written about the place in question being difficult&#x2014;or downright dangerous&#x2014;was exaggeration and lies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What I mean,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe said, &#x201c;is that Bobonong is not as big as Gaborone. That is all. I was thinking of how it must feel to come from a small place to a big place. There is nothing wrong with Bobonong, Mma. It is a very fine place.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mollified by this explanation, Mma Makutsi pointed out that Mma Ramotswe had herself made a similar transition. &#x201c;Of course, you came from Mochudi, Mma,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That is just a village, after all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, there we are,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe, relieved at the defus�ing of the discussion. &#x201c;We are both village girls at heart.&#x201d; She paused, and then added, &#x201c;But coping very well in the city&#x2014;both of us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They returned to Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s first day at the Botswana Sec�retarial College and to the topic of short skirts.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There I was,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi continued. &#x201c;I was, I admit it, a bit nervous about being at college. There were thirty-two girls in my year and they all seemed to be so much more confident than I was. They knew Gaborone well, and talked about places I had never even heard of&#x2014;about which shop sold what, and where you could get your hair or nails done. These were things I&#x2019;d never even thought about, let alone explored, and I was very much out of it, Mma. I had no idea what to say.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all had that sort of experience,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;Every one of us, Mma. We&#x2019;ve all had a first day at school, or a first day in a new job. We&#x2019;ve all been unsure what to do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi gazed out of the window. &#x201c;I just sat there, Mma. I sat at the back of the class with all these other girls talking to one another as if they had been friends for many years. I knew nobody, Mma&#x2014;not a single soul. And then . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe waited. She could picture Mma Makutsi in those early days at the Botswana Secretarial College&#x2014;earnest and attentive, desperate to make a success of this great chance she had been given, trying hard not to worry about where the next <i>pula </i>or <i>thebe </i>was coming from; hungry, no doubt, because she would have had to choose between food and textbooks, and would have chosen the latter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi took off her large round spectacles and began to polish them. Mma Ramotswe had noticed that this was an action that preceded the recollection of something painful, and so she was not too surprised by what followed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And then,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;at the end of that very first lecture&#x2014;it was a lecture on the importance of high standards, Mma, and it was delivered by the principal herself&#x2014;at the end of that first lecture we went outside for a short break. Because I was sitting at the back, I was the last out, and the others were all standing in groups, all chatting in the same way as they had been earlier on. I did not know where to go and so I was pleased when one of the girls called me over to join her group. She said, &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you come and talk to us?&#x2019; And I said, &#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;ll come.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi replaced her spectacles. &#x201c;And do you know who that was, Mma Ramotswe? That was Violet Sephotho.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi said. &#x201c;It was her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And was that the first time you had seen her, Mma?&#x201d; asked Mma Ramotswe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi nodded. &#x201c;I must have seen her in the lecture room, but I had not really noticed her. Now I noticed her, because nobody could miss what she was wearing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I can imagine it,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Can you, Mma? I think it may have been even worse than what you think. A <i>very </i>short skirt, Mma.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe did not find that surprising.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The skirt was red, Mma, and then there was a blouse that was hardly a blouse. In fact, you might even have thought that her blouse was made from that stuff they make curtains out of&#x2014;you know those curtains you can sort of see out of&#x2014;not proper curtains. What do they call that material, Mma?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gauze?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. Phuti&#x2019;s aunt has curtains like that in her bathroom. I am sure people in the street can look right through them, and so when we go to visit her I always hang a towel over the window, just in case.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is very wise, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;People have no business looking into the bathrooms of other people.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They certainly do not, Mma. Or through any other windows for that matter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe pursed her lips. She was about to agree, but realised that she herself occasionally&#x2014;and only very occasionally&#x2014;glanced through the windows of others if she was passing by. She would never go up to the window and peer inside&#x2014;that was very wrong&#x2014;but if you were walking along a street and you walked past a window, then surely it was permissible to have a quick glance, just to see the sort of furniture that they liked, or the pictures on the wall, or possibly to see who was sitting in the room. If people did not want anybody to see what was going on in the room, then they should pull down a blind or something of that sort&#x2014;an open window was an indication, surely, that they did not mind if passers-by looked in.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, of course, as a private detective you had to know what was going on. If you kept your eyes fixed straight ahead of you, then you would be unable to gather the sort of everyday intelligence that was part and parcel of your job, and without that intelligence your ability to help others woul...</p><h2>Anne Frank The Diary Of A Young Girl (Black And White Cover) /anglais</h2><p><p>Anne Frank's <i>The Diary of a Young Girl </i>is an inspiring and tragic account of an ordinary life lived in extraordinary circumstances that has enthralled readers for generations.

It brings you peace of mind and shows you how to live in a higher, more harmonious way.</p><p>"We&#x2019;re all spiritual beings endowed with six, not five senses, and, even more important, we need that sixth sense, our intuition or our &#x2018;vibes,&#x2019; to fulfill our life&#x2019;s purpose and be peaceful and happy. Sadly, few people realize we have this important spiritual sense, let alone know how to access or listen to it. The good news is that we&#x2019;re all naturally designed to be &#x2018;sixth-sensory.&#x2019; Without being connected to this incredible inner guidance system, we become lost and disoriented. This isn&#x2019;t the natural way to live, nor is it necessary to live like this." <br>&#x2014; Sonia ChoquetteSonia Choquette is a world-renowned intuitive and spiritual teacher who specializes in helping us recognize that we&#39; all endowed with a sixth sense that we can count on.

And adventure Bo gets, the day Harmony Jean breaks in her brand-new chili-pepper-red cowboy boots by the banks of Can Creek.<br><br>Peering out across the creek bed, Bo is sure he's spotted a rip-roarin', rootin'-tootin', shiny red armadillo! Bo's off and running after his new friend--right down to the Curly H Rodeo.<br><br>There Bo gets to do all the things he's dreamed of doing: he rides a bronc, eats red-hot chili peppers, and even tries the two-step. Bo is ready to follow his pal off into the sunset, but he is about to discover his new friend is no ordinary armadillo.<br><br>Jan Brett turns her considerable storytelling talents toward the Texas countryside in this warm and funny story of an armadillo on his own. Luckily, Ma Armadillo and her boys are searching for Bo in the borders to bring him back home.</p><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p><p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says. "I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting."</p><p>Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. "From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books."</p>Brett (The Wild Christmas Reindeer; Trouble with Trolls) here gives her trademark, exquisitely detailed art a Western flair as she sets this endearing tale "deep in the heart of Texas hill country." "Don't go gettin' distracted on me," a mother armadillo cautions Bo, one of her four young 'uns. Undeterred, the ever-curious Bo follows a lizard down to the creek just as young Harmony Jean slides down the bank, trying to scuff up her brand-new "pointy-toed, high-heeled, hand-tooled chili-pepper red boots with fancy cutwork, tall tops, and a Curly H brand." Bo (who, like all armadillos, can't see very well) mistakes the boots for a shiny red armadillo, whom he greets with a friendly "Howdy." Impeccably reproducing the design, stitching and trims of Western clothing, border panels follow Bo's brothers and Ma as they search for their weak-eyed wanderer. He, meanwhile, is having the time of his life at the Curly H rodeo, where he rides on the back of Harmony Jean's horse, munches on a jalape?o pepper under a table and kicks up his heels at a barn dance-all in the company of his new "friend." The high-spirited hero and action-filled art will please the author/artist's many fans.

Ha Jin profoundly understands the conflict between the individual and society, between the timeless universality of the human heart and constantly shifting politics of the moment. With wisdom, restraint, and empathy for all his characters, he vividly reveals the complexities and subtleties of a world and a people we desperately need to know."--Judges' Citation, National Book Award<br><br>"Ha Jin's novel could hardly be less theatrical, yet we're immediately engaged by its narrative structure, by its wry humor and by the subtle, startling shifts it produces in our understanding of characters and their situation."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Subtle and complex--his best work to date. A moving meditation on the effects of time upon love."--<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>"A high achievement indeed."--Ian Buruma, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"A portrait of Chinese provincial life that terrifies with its emptiness even more than with its all-pervasive vulgarity. The poet in [Jin] intersperses these human scenes with achingly beautiful vignettes of natural beauty."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A simple love story that transcends cultural barriers--. From the idyllic countryside to the small towns in northeast China, Jin's depictions are filled with an earthy poetic grace--. Jin's account of daily life in China is convincing and rich in detail."--<i>The Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Compassionate, earthy, robust, and wise, <b>Waiting</b> blends provocative allegory with all-too-human comedy. The result touches and reveals, bringing to life a singular world in its spectacular intricacy."--Gish Jen, author of <b>Who's Irish?</b><br><br>"A remarkable love story. Ha Jin's understanding of the human heart and the human condition transcends borders and time. <b>Waiting</b> is an outstanding literary achievement."--Lisa See, author of <b>On Gold Mountain</b></p><p>"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu." Like a fairy tale, Ha Jin's masterful novel of love and politics begins with a formula--and like a fairy tale, <i>Waiting</i> uses its slight, deceptively simple framework to encompass a wide range of truths about the human heart. Lin Kong is a Chinese army doctor trapped in an arranged marriage that embarrasses and repels him. (Shuyu has country ways, a withered face, and most humiliating of all, bound feet.) Nevertheless, he's content with his tidy military life, at least until he falls in love with Manna, a nurse at his hospital. Regulations forbid an army officer to divorce without his wife's consent--until 18 years have passed, that is, after which he is free to marry again. So, year after year Lin asks his wife for his freedom, and year after year he returns from the provincial courthouse: still married, still unable to consummate his relationship with Manna. Nothing feeds love like obstacles placed in its way--right? But Jin's novel answers the question of what might have happened to Romeo and Juliet had their romance been stretched out for several decades. In the initial confusion of his chaste love affair, Lin longs for the peace and quiet of his "old rut." Then killing time becomes its own kind of rut, and in the end, he is forced to conclude that he "waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting." <p> There's a political allegory here, of course, but it grows naturally from these characters' hearts. Neither Lin nor Manna is especially ideological, and the tumultuous events occurring around them go mostly unnoticed. They meet during a forced military march, and have their first tender moment during an opera about a naval battle. (While the audience shouts, "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" the couple holds hands and gazes dreamily into each other's eyes.) When Lin is in Goose Village one summer, a mutual acquaintance rapes Manna; years later, the rapist appears on a TV report titled "To Get Rich Is Glorious," after having made thousands in construction. Jin resists hammering ideological ironies like these home, but totalitarianism's effects on Lin are clear: </p><blockquote> Let me tell you what really happened, the voice said. All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. You were misled by your own frustration and passivity, believing that what you were not allowed to have was what your heart was destined to embrace. </blockquote> Ha Jin himself served in the People's Liberation Army, and in fact left his native country for the U.S. only in 1985. That a non-native speaker can produce English of such translucence and power is truly remarkable--but really, his prose is the least of the miracles here. Improbably, Jin makes an unconsummated 18-year love affair loom as urgent as political terror or war, while history-changing events gain the immediacy of a domestic dilemma. Gracefully phrased, impeccably paced, <i>Waiting</i> is the kind of realist novel you thought was no longer being written. <i>--Mary Park</i>"Compassionate, earthy, robust, and wise, Waiting blends provocative allegory with all-too-human comedy. The result touches and reveals, bringing to life a singular world in its spectacular intricacy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Gish Jen, author of <b>Who's Irish?</b><br><br>"A remarkable love story.

Carrier re-examines the whole question and finds compelling reasons to suspect the more daring assumption is correct. He lays out extensive research on the evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity and poses the key questions that must now be answered if the historicity of Jesus is to survive as a dominant paradigm. Carrier contrasts the most credible reconstruction of a historical Jesus with the most credible theory of Christian origins if a historical Jesus did not exist. Such a theory would posit that the Jesus figure was originally conceived of as a celestial being known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture; then stories placing this being in earth history were crafted to communicate the claims of the gospel allegorically; such stories eventually came to be believed or promoted in the struggle for control of the Christian churches that survived the tribulations of the first century. Carrier finds the latter theory more credible than has been previously imagined. He explains why it offers a better explanation for all the disparate evidence surviving from the first two centuries of the Christian era. He argues that we need a more careful and robust theory of cultural syncretism between Jewish theology and politics of the second-temple period and the most popular features of pagan religion and philosophy of the time. For anyone intent on defending a historical Jesus, this is the book to challenge.</p><p></p><h2>The Confident Woman: Start Today Living Boldly and Without Fear</h2><p><b>What keeps women from being their best? Joyce has been helping women better themselves by helping identify emotional barriers and physical, mental, and spiritual obstacles in their lives for years. Now she provides another answer-confidence. </b><br><br>Our society has an insecurity epidemic, women in particular. Compensating by pretending to be secure-a common response-only leads to feelings of shame. Lack of self-confidence causes great difficulty in relationships of all kinds, and in marriage instances can even lead to divorce. <br><br>In THE CONFIDENT WOMAN, Joyce explores the seven characteristics of a woman with confidence, which include a woman who knows she is loved, who refuses to live in fear, and who does not live by comparisons. Joyce explains that confidence stems from being positive in your actions and living honestly, but most importantly from having faith, in God and in ourselves.</p><p>Joyce Meyer is one of the world's leading practical Bible teachers. A #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, she has written more than eighty inspirational books, including <em>Never Give Up!, </em><i>The Secret to True Happiness, 100 Ways to Simplify Your Life</i>, the entire Battlefield of the Mind family of books, her first venture into fiction with <i>The Penny</i>,<i> </i>and many others. She has also released thousands of audio teachings, as well as a complete video library.

Joyce and her husband, Dave, are the parents of four grown children and make their home in St. Louis, Missouri.Pat Lentz&#39;s soft, clear voice narrates Meyer&#39;s work on how to become a confident woman. With careful attention, she describes seven secrets of confidence and explores how to live without fear, conquer the damage of abuse, and overcome false expectations. Her interpretation of Apostle Paul&#39;s controversial comments on women in 1 Corinthians is especially believable. She perfectly renders the description of a woman from Proverbs 31 who represents the differences between godly women and worldly women. Lentz delivers the author&#39;s vital message with clarity as she teaches how to step into the future with boldness, armed with renewed confidence and eager to explore new possibilities.

The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet its apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick, to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmans writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious. The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalises magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: the art, science and culture of experiencing truth.</p><p>Alan Chapman is a Western magician and writer, a Magus of the A.&#x2019;.A.&#x2019;. and a member of numerous secret societies.

Then you can do the same things He did&#x2014;even greater! &#x201c;Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me (Jesus), the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father&#x201d; (John 14:12). In his book Moving Mountains, Richie Lewis shares the simple, yet powerful message God spoke directly to him about healing: &#x201c;When people ask you to pray for some kind of illness or injury instead of praying over them I want you to declare healing over them.&#x201d; This word not only changed how he ministered to the sick, but sent Richie on a mission encouraging all Christians to go into the world and do what Jesus and his disciples did. This book is a clarion call for every believer to know they have this same authority&#x2014;to heal the sick, cast out demons, and share the good news of Jesus. As you read Moving Mountains, you&#x2019;ll be encouraged in your faith, to step out and declare what God has already done!</p><p>Richie Lewis has had an unquenchable passion to see people enter into a relationship with Jesus Christ since the moment he was saved. He has a passion to motivate, inspire and equip the Body of Christ to reach out beyond the four walls of the church. Richie and his wife Bethany have been married for ten years and have a seven year old son, Micah.</p><h2>A Dictionary of Northern Mythology</h2><p>For two and a half thousand years, from 1500 BC to AD 1000, a culture as significant as the classical civilisation of the Mediterranean world settled an immense area in northern Europe that stretched from Iceland to the Black Sea.

In compiling this dictionary Rudolf Simek has made the fullest possible use of the information available -Christian accounts, Eddic lays, the Elder Edda, runic inscriptions, Roman authors (especially Tacitus), votive stones, place names and archaeological discoveries.

Overturning this long-established historical narrative, Freddy Silva shows that the Order of the Temple existed a decade earlier on the opposite side of Europe, that the protection of pilgrims was entrusted to a separate organization, and that, in league with the Cistercian monks and the equally mysterious Order of Sion, the Templars executed one of history&#x2019;s most daring and covert plans: the creation of Europe&#x2019;s first nation-state, Portugal, with one of their own as king. <br><br>Including over 700 references, many from new and rare sources, Silva reveals Portugal, not Jerusalem, as the first Templar stronghold. He shows how there were eleven founding members and how the first king of Portugal, a secret Templar, was related to Bernard de Clairvaux, head of the Cistercians. The author explains the Templars&#x2019; motivation to create a country far from the grasp of Rome, where they could conduct their living resurrection initiation--whose candidates were declared &#x201c;risen from the dead&#x201d;--a secret for which the Church silenced millions and which the Templars protected to the death. <br><br>Placing the intrepid Knights in a previously unknown time and place, Silva&#x2019;s historical narrative reveals the Portuguese roots of key founding members, their relationship with the Order of Sion, the Templars&#x2019; unshakeable devotion to Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist, and how they protected a holy bloodline in Portugal. He also provides evidence of secret Templar holy sites, initiation chambers, and hidden passageways throughout Portugal, often coinciding with pagan and Neolithic temples, and explains how their most important site forms a perfect triangle with the Abbey of Mont Sion in Jerusalem and the Osirion temple in Egypt. The author also reappraises the meaning of the Grail and reveals its exact location, hidden in plain sight to this very day.</p><p>Freddy Silva is a leading researcher of alternative history, ancient knowledge, sacred sites, and the interaction between temples and consciousness.

Principles are explained in brief, and backed by extensive illustrations that show you how to design details that will not leak water or air, will control the flow of heat and water vapor, will adjust to all kinds of movement, and will be easy to construct. This new third edition has been updated to conform to International Building Code 2012, and incorporates current knowledge about new material and construction technology. Sustainable design issues are integrated where relevant, and the discussion includes reviews of recent built works that extract underlying principles that can be the basis for new patterns or the alteration and addition to existing patterns. Regulatory topics are primarily focused on the US, but touch on other jurisdictions and geographic settings to give you a well-rounded perspective of the art and science of architectural detailing.</p> <p>In guiding a design from idea to reality, architects design a set of details that show how a structure will be put together. Good details are correct, complete, and provide accurate information to a wide variety of users.

It&#x2019;s a moment forever captured, an iconic image that has come to define the horror and violence of the Vietnam War.

When the napalm bombs dropped, everything Kim knew and relied on exploded along with them: her home, her country&#x2019;s freedom, her childhood innocence and happiness.

RUN! THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY THIS WHOLE PLACE!&#x201d;</b><br>The soldier&#x2019;s commands left no room for ambiguity. . . . With us children leading the way, we fled the outbuildings; we ran toward the front of the temple grounds; we made our way from the property onto the adjacent road, Trang Bang&#x2019;s Route 1; and we pedaled our legs as fast as they could carry us as hell rose up to clutch earth.<br><br>Seconds later, I caught sight of an airplane closing in on me. It was jolting to take in something so immense, so fast, and so earth-shatteringly loud, and the magnitude of its presence left me paralyzed there on the road. . . . Perhaps I would have stood there for an eternity, my feet unable to move, were it not for what I saw next.<br><br>The fly-by was not an inconsequential event, for falling from that underbelly were four large ice-black bombs. . . . I knew I had to flee. These were not bombs that fell heavily from the sky, as I had heard that bombs would do; no, these bombs all but floated down. There was something sinister in those cans.<br><br>&#x201c;Nooo! Nooo!&#x201d; I screamed to nobody but the air surrounding me, all of the other children and soldiers having disappeared into the dense clouds of smoke that now encroached. <i>I will die here on this road. I will be taken to death in these flames.</i>&#x201c;Napalm girl&#x201d; Kim Phuc (<i>Girl in the Picture</i>) gained inadvertent fame as a 1970s antiwar icon when a photographer took a picture of her as she ran naked from a napalm attack in Vietnam. Kim Phuc now provides the story behind the photo, chronicling her idyllic Vietnamese childhood in a prosperous home, the effects of the painful burns across her body, and her personal trials as she traveled from Vietnam to Cuba and then to Canada. Her Christian conversion is central to her journey, and much of the memoir attests to God&#x2019;s power in her life. Kim Phuc, raised within the CaoDai religion of Vietnam, explains how she found solace in Jesus&#x2019;s suffering and in the stories of Paul after coming across the New Testament in a Saigon library. Vietnamese &#x201c;minders&#x201d; working for the Communist government were a constant presence in her life as officials begin to realize Kim Phuc&#x2019;s value as &#x201c;Vietnam&#x2019;s token propaganda tool.&#x201d; Although the book&#x2019;s faith elements are uplifting and Kim Phuc&#x2019;s descriptions of her conversion are heartfelt, the writing is most lively when she describes her frustrations with the Cold War and its negative impact on her recovery. However, throughout her journey, &#x201c;marked by distractions, abuses, and false starts,&#x201d; Kim Phuc exhibits forceful resolve, steely self-determination, and seemingly limitless empathy. This spare and lucid memoir will touch readers of all faiths and nationalities.

Smiles of recognition turn into grins of enthusiasm as more people discover them and dream about making their own private retreats or family play spaces. And it's nice to remind ourselves that treehouses are built into the oldest and most forgiving, living things on earth. Also, history records treehouses as being built as deliberate follies, as challenges for arboreal designers, for merrymaking, and for keeping the spirit of fairy tales alive. But treehouses can also be social places. We will visit many that were built to entertain, to hang out with friends, or as guest houses. Trees come in all types.</p><p>Master treehouse builders Peter and Judy Nelson, with David Larkin, have embarked on yet another treehouse-discovery expedition across America, this time adding the investigation of backyard playhouses to their agenda.

Five stars.&#x201d; &#x2014; San Francisco Book Review &#x201c;A must-read for anyone interested in the Middle East. Five stars.&#x201d; &#x2014; Manhattan Book Review "Lightbourne writes in a cinematic prose and easily folds in background about the Kurdish people&#x2019;s suffering under Saddam Hussein. This story of sisterhood, motherhood, and nationhood should have wide appeal." &#x2014; BookLife Inspired by the incredible true story of an American teacher in northern Iraq, The Kurdish Bike is a gripping, compassionate and often wry tale of adventure set in one of the world&#x2019;s least understood cultures. It is 2010, and Theresa Turner responds to an online ad for &#x201c;courageous teachers to help rebuild a war-torn country.&#x201d; Landing in a repressive school for Kurd elites, she yearns to experience the "real&#x201d; Kurdistan, buys a bicycle, and explores the nearby villages and countryside. When she is befriended by a local widow, Theresa is embroiled in the joys and agonies of traditional Kurds, especially the women who survived Saddam&#x2019;s genocide only to be crippled by age-old restrictions, female genital mutilation (FGM), brutality and honor killings. She experiences a female bonding that transcends cultures, and a generosity that staggers the imagination. Theresa&#x2019;s greatest challenge will be balancing respect for local values while trying to introduce more enlightened attitudes toward women &#x2014; at the same time seeking new spiritual dimensions within herself. The Kurdish Bike is a novel of love, betrayal and redemption. Well-developed characters face life-and-death decisions, and are not always who they seem. Unexpected changes back home have devastating impacts on the expatriates. And it is impossible to determine who is a genuine ally in such a foreign setting. Add to this the main character's desire for inner transformation, and you have a must-read page turner that haunts the reader for months. It is the winner of the Gold Medal for Best Regional eBook from Independent Publishers (2017), First Prize in the North Street Book Awards (2017), and Readers Favorite Best Cultural Fiction Bronze Medal (2018). The Kurdish Bike is highly recommended for book clubs. The author gives frequent presentations on Kurdish culture to clubs, public libraries, universities, churches, community service groups, etc. and will speak to groups via Skype upon request. She is a passionate supporter of women's causes in rural Kurdistan, and is committed to helping the women described in the book create a better life for themselves.

The answer is, almost everything except for a few scenes at the end. Given the ultra-sensitive nature of the topics addressed, such as female genital mutilation, honor killing and terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, I felt it necessary to protect my friends in Kurdistan from shame, ostracism and possible imprisonment.Given the remarkable generosity of Kurdish village women, and the fact that&nbsp;<b>Kurds</b>&nbsp;are in the headlines today, I felt honor-bound to write their story. I wanted the Western world to understand the hardships these women have faced, and continue to face on a daily basis. Many of their challenges are the result of global politics. But others arise from an age-old culture of male dominance, where women are given few choices, and have very limited options for self-reliance.I have lived and worked in six countries around the globe. My time amongst the Kurds in 2010 was the most transformational by far, due to the lessons I learned from humble village women. Many of my friends were illiterate. All had lost family members to Saddam's genocide. Most were (and still are) living in poverty, because they lack the means or social opportunities to better their own lives.My greatest joy arising from <i>The Kurdish Bike</i> has been speaking to book clubs, churches, college classes, libraries and other civic groups. When audiences see real photos, and hear the real back story behind the book, they are moved to compassion for the brave, tenacious and wise people of Kurdistan. Any donations from audiences go directly to the main characters in the novel, who are in dire circumstances. To request a presentation (in person in Central California, otherwise via Skype), contact the author via social media or the book's website.Learning more about the Kurds is important, given current conditions in the Middle East. The Kurds were the primary ally of the United States in fighting ISIS, laying down their lives by the tens of thousands under our direction. However, now that ISIS is more or less contained, the Kurds expect a pay-off, namely the political independence they have long sought. The US is caught between rewarding the Kurds, and standing strong with an even bigger ally, Turkey -- with no apparent resolution on the horizon.I think that one of the reasons the book has won two big prizes, and is such a popular&nbsp;<b>book club book</b>, is that it addresses tough issues like cultural sensitivity. Being immersed in&nbsp;<b>Kurdish culture</b>&nbsp;made me re-evaluate the training I'd received in college anthropology classes, where the social scientist is expected to be a non-judgmental sponge, absorbing cultural practices that form part of a cohesive whole. But this is easier said than done. At the same time, I wanted to convey the often-hilarious situations that an expat teacher finds him or herself in. I am delighted every time a reviewer calls places in the book "funny".Expatriate fiction can be tricky. You don't want to be arrogant or an Ugly American. You also want to maintain your own identity and self-respect as you adapt to the foreign culture. I really hope that <i>The Kurdish Bike</i>, like&nbsp;<b><i>The Kite Runner</i>,</b>&nbsp;walks that fine line, and provides a window of understanding to Western hearts and minds.With Kurds in international headlines today, this multiple-award-winning book is essential reading for anyone wanting to learn more about the Middle East.When an ordinary American teacher becomes accepted by women in an Iraqi Kurdish village, she witnesses the extraordinary contradictions of a modernizing Islamic culture. Women are murdered by men in their own family in "honor killings". Fellow Americans defect to join Al Qaida. Female students are slated for ritual mutilation. How will she apply the cultural relativism she learned in anthropology to what feels like horrific behavior? And how can she overcome personal challenges when juxtaposing them against the much-greater hardships of women who survived rape, torture and genocide under Saddam Hussein?Because the book is based on a real story, book clubs enjoy grappling with the complex issues it raises. Praised for lyricism, life-like characters and unexpected humor at times,&nbsp;<i>The Kurdish Bike</i>&nbsp;introduces Western readers to a little-known people currently fighting for their political existence -- underscoring the resilience and beauty of the human spirit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Being Human: Bodies, Minds, Persons</h2><p><p>What is consciousness? Is the mind a machine? What makes each of us a person? How do our bodies relate to our minds?</p><p>In this deeply engaging exploration of what it means to be human, Rowan Williams addresses these frequently asked questions with lucid meditations that draw from findings in neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and literature. Then he presses on to ask, Might faith be necessary to human flourishing? If so, why? And how can a traditional Christian practice&#x2014;namely, silence&#x2014;help us advance on the path to human maturity?</p><p>The book ends with a brief but profound meditation on Christ&#x2019;s ascension, inviting readers to consider how, through Jesus, our humanity in all its variety and vulnerability has been transfigured and taken into the heart of the divine life.</p><p><i>Being Human</i>&nbsp;is a book that readers of all religious persuasions will find both challenging and highly rewarding.

In this study of the meaning and scope of the covenant, Michael D. Williams highlights the goodness of the physical realm and God&#39;s redemptive intentions for his creation.</p><p><b>Michael D.

What a wonderful book!" --<b>William Edgar</b><br><br>"When I used a prepublication copy to teach seminary students, they found the book to be reader-friendly and the story of the intimate connection between creation and redemption easy to follow. They were deeply moved by the power of the Bible's own covenant narrative. Some were surprised to be opened to new ways of looking at God, his world, salvation, and themselves. The book is clear, thoughtful, and faithful to Scripture." --<b>Robert A. Peterson</b></p><h2>The Bird and the Sword</h2><p><i>Swallow, daughter, pull them in, those words that sit upon your lips.

Then she predicted the king would sell his soul and lose his son to the sky. My father has a claim to the throne, and he is waiting in the shadows for all of my mother&#x2019;s words to come to pass. He wants desperately to be king, and I just want to be free. But freedom will require escape, and I&#x2019;m a prisoner of my mother&#x2019;s curse and my father&#x2019;s greed. I can&#x2019;t speak or make a sound, and I can&#x2019;t wield a sword or beguile a king.

In his distinct voice we hear Wilder's inside view on his collaborations with such stars as Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, William Holden, Audrey Hepburn, and Greta Garbo (he was a writer at MGM during the making of <i>Ninotchka</i>. Here are Wilder's sharp and funny behind-the-scenes stories about the making of <i>A Foreign Affair, Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Love in the Afternoon, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment</i>, and <i>Ace in the Hole</i>, among many others. Wilder is ever mysterious, but Crowe gets him to speak candidly on Stanwyck: "She knew the script, everybody's lines, never a fault, never a mistake"; on Cary Grant: "I had Cary Grant in mind for four of my pictures . . . slipped through my net every time"; on the "Lubitsch Touch": "It was the elegant use of the super-joke." Wilder also remembers his early years in Vienna, working as a journalist in Berlin, rooming with Peter Lorre at the Chateau Marmont -- always with the same dry wit, tough-minded romanticism, and elegance that are the hallmarks of Wilder's films. This book is a classic of Hollywood history and lore.</p><p><i>Conversations with Wilder</i>, an invaluable, photo-intensive volume, is a kind of remake of Truffaut's must-read interview book <i>Hitchcock</i>, with Cameron Crowe in the inquisitive Truffaut role and wily 93-year-old Billy Wilder as the crafty master director. Drawing on his experience interviewing the monsters of rock and his deep, shot-by-shot knowledge of Wilder's work, Crowe gently and cunningly coaxes answers from Wilder--arguably today's most influential living director--on what made his hits tick and his flops suck, along with glimpses of what might have been. Did you know Mae West and Mary Pickford spurned <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> and Wilder spurned Marilyn Monroe for <i>Irma la Douce</i>? That <i>The Apartment</i> was inspired by <i>Brief Encounter</i> and the look of <i>Double Indemnity</i> was based on <i>M</i>? The gossipy insights are great too. Bogart spat when he talked, so Wilder couldn't back-light him in <i>Sabrina</i>, and Audrey Hepburn's wardrobe woman had to towel her off after each take--discreetly! Wilder loathed Raymond Chandler (partly because Chandler disdained James M. Cain when adapting <i>Double Indemnity</i>) but gives him his due as a screenwriter: Chandler could do dialogue and descriptions, but he couldn't construct a scene. "He was a mess, but he could write a beautiful sentence," says Wilder. Agatha Christie was the opposite: "She had structure, but she lacked poetry."<p> Some critics scoff at Crowe (who cried while directing emotional scenes in <i>Jerry Maguire</i>) for taking on the cynic Wilder. But they're brothers under the skin. Both leaped from popular music journalism to directing. Both incorporate actual events in their films. Wilder keenly regrets not filming this scene in <i>The Spirit of St. Louis</i>, which he claims really happened: the night before his historic flight, Lindbergh's handlers talked a pretty waitress into having sex with him. They claimed he was a virgin, and likely to die on his voyage. In the hero's parade upon his return, she waves at him through the ticker-tape, but he doesn't see her. "Would have been a good scene," mourns Wilder. Without this book, we'd never have known about it. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"A world-class director interviews the Master, and every line is fascinating. As with <b>Zen and the Art of Archery</b> and other texts about mastery, the shock of pleasure in reading this enlightened and affectionate conversation is the utter simplicity that comes with true mastery. There is laughter too, as with anything first-rate in this form. Wilder and Crowe don't waste time on theory or generalities, and the result -- as in their film work -- is truth, pure and simple." -- Mike Nichols<br><br>"It's always best to hear straight from the director about his own work. This book of interviews is just that: rich in information and autobiographical detail, filled with wonderful anecdotes and observations, often irreverent and hilarious, and sometimes surprisingly moving. Cameron Crowe's book is like Wilder's best films: sharply observed, absolutely succinct and precise, funny but always with a very strong, serious foundation. Billy Wilder is one of the few genuine masters we have left, from a period in film history that is now gone. Which makes <b>Conversations with Wilder</b> all the more precious and valuable." -- Martin Scorsese</p><h2>How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy (Genre Writing)</h2><p>Offers tips and advice on writing science fiction, discussing the rules of fiction, and how to structure a successful story</p><p></p><h2>Practical Magic</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>For most adults, fairy tales are among the childish things we've put away. Alice Hoffman, however, feels differently. <i>Practical Magic</i> starts out as a tale of Gillian and Sally Owens, two orphaned girls whose aunts are witches--of a mild sort. For the past two centuries, Owens women have been blamed for all that has gone wrong in their Massachusetts town, ever since their ancestor arrived, rich, independent, and soon accused of theft: "And then one day, a farmer winged a crow in his cornfield, a creature who'd been stealing from him shamelessly for months. When Maria Owens appeared the very next morning with her arm in a sling and her white hand wound up in a white bandage, people felt certain they knew the reason why." The aunts are daily ostracized by the same upstanding citizens who sneak to their house at night for magical love cures. To the sisters they are for the most part benevolently absent, though their bell, book, and candle routine makes life a torment for Gillian, beautiful and blonde and lazy, and Sally, who's all too responsible. But when one of the aunts' cures works too well, ending as a curse, the dangers of real love become all too clear. In Hoffman's world being bewitched, bothered, and bewildered is no mere metaphor--and neither is desire. The elbows of one enamored man pucker a linoleum counter, another walks around with singed cuffs. It's difficult to catch the author's power in brief quotes. She needs space and increment to build her exquisite variations of vision and reality, her matter-of-fact announcements of the preternatural. <i>Practical Magic</i> again and again makes one recall the thrill of hearing at bedtime, "Now will I a tale unfold..." <i>--Kerry Fried</i>Alice Hoffman is the author of thirty works of fiction, including Practical Magic, The Red Garden, The Dovekeepers and, most recently,The Museum of Extraordinary Things.

But in <i>700 Sundays</i>, a memoir based on his one-man Broadway play of the same name, Crystal tells his own story, dissecting an often complex relationship with his father and how that relationship resonated in other aspects of his life. His father, Jack Crystal was an influential jazz concert promoter and operated an influential jazz record label, affording his son an opportunity to tell stories of being taken to his first movie by Billie Holliday and seeing his grandmother suggest that Louis Armstrong simply "try coughing it up." But Jack died when his son was fifteen years old, soon after a forever-unresolved argument between the two, leaving Billy to cope with crushing grief while simultaneously and perhaps ironically trying to launch a career in comedy. This lends <i>700 Sundays</i> much needed gravity in a volume that is packed with zingy one-liners and whimsical observations that serve to illustrate the comedy career Crystal forged, while also providing some decent laughs. Interestingly, there is very little reference to the better known accomplishments of Crystal&#x2019;s Hollywood career as the author chooses to focus instead on the seemingly mundane but highly entertaining aspects of his Long Island roots. Though <i>700 Sundays</i> (the name comes from Crystal&#x2019;s estimation of how many Sundays he got to spend with his father) is packaged here in book form, it reads like a piece of theater and, more specifically, like a selection of memories about a father, lovingly and touchingly re-told by his loving son. <i>--John Moe</i>BILLY CRYSTAL has created one of the most versatile and prolific careers in the entertainment industry. Beginning with the popular series Soap, he went on to phenomenal success on Saturday Night Live, creating memorable characters, including his impersonation of Sammy Davis Jr. and Fernando of &#34;You Look Mahvelous!&#34; fame. A writer, director, and producer, Crystal was the first comedian to perform in the then-Soviet Union with his HBO special Midnight Train to Moscow. In addition, Crystal has hosted the Grammy� Awards three times, and, of course, the Oscars eight times.

The &#34;Tang&#34;&#39;s captain, Cmdr. Richard O&#39; Kane, was a celebrated maverick whose contempt for the enemy was absolute. He was offered the opportunity to operate alone in the dangerous Formosa Strait, and the boat&#39;s crew sank 13 ships on one of the most destructive patrols of the war. But the last torpedo malfunctioned and boomeranged on the &#34;Tang,&#34; killing half the crew instantly and sinking the sub. The explosion threw O&#39; Kane and several others into the ocean, but most of the rest were trapped below; only nine of 87 survived. They were picked up by a Japanese patrol boat and taken to a POW camp, tortured and starved. O&#39; Kane, who earned the Medal of Honor, weighed only 88 pounds when liberated. Relying on interviews with survivors and oral histories, and writing with his customary verve, Kershaw delivers another memorable tale of uncommon courage.&#34;--&#34;Publishers Weekly,&#34; starred review &#34;This tremendous read...shouldn&#39;t be missed.&#34;--&#34;Boston Herald&#34; 5/7/08 &#34;Kershaw&#39;s vivid account of heroism and survival is so riveting, it can only be so long before Hollywood scoops it up to adapt for the big screen.&#34;--&#34;Entertainment Weekly&#34; 5/9/08 &#34;Kershaw has researched exhaustively, including interviewing the last two living survivors, and written compactly the portrait of nine Americans who rose to heroism and of a ship that well deserved its status--it was the most successful combat sub in the Pacific theater--as a legend in the naval history of World War II.&#34;--&#34;Booklist&#34; &#34;&#34;Escape from the Deep&#34; is a must read for any submariner.&#34;--SubmarineResearch.com &#34;A &#34;page-turner&#34; that tells a &#34;riveting story.&#34; Alex Kershaw is &#34;a raconteur [with] a screenwriter&#39;s style that&#39;s most intimate and spellbinding...damn-the-torpedoes storytelling.&#34;--&#34;USA Today&#34;&#34;A stirring story of the human spirit&#34;--&#34;Rocky Mountain News&#34; 5/29/08 &#34;Told in action adventure prose...Alex Kershaw&#39;s &#34;Escape from the Deep&#34; moves crisply from scene to scene, shifting points of view and time sequences to keep the survival narrative front and center...

By the author of Cold Service. 250,000 first printing.</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Why? It takes a tough guy to get the answer to a tough question like that, especially when no one else wants to know. Spenser's the tough guy who's looking for answers in a school shooting case in this latest novel. Narrating as the Boston gumshoe, Joe Mantegna adds a light touch to Spenser's toughness, drawing laughs with his reading of wry, erudite lines. As the investigation gets more serious, Mantegna's narration turns more dramatic. Always, he highlights Parker's carefully drawn sense of place and eye for detail, sounding as naturally observant as a private eye. More than a puzzle, this novel shines light on the human factor in tragedy.

I am hungry.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>When I heard him, I didn&#x2019;t really hear him. His words were part of the clatter, like a car horn or someone yelling for a cab. They were, you could say, just noise&#x2014;the kind of nuisance New Yorkers learn to tune out. So I walked right by him, as if he wasn&#x2019;t there. </i><br><br><i>But then, just a few yards past him, I stopped. </i><br><br><i>And then&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m still not sure why I did this&#x2014;I came back.</i><br><br>When Laura Schroff first met Maurice on a New York City street corner, she had no idea that she was standing on the brink of an incredible and unlikely friendship that would inevitably change both their lives. As one lunch at McDonald&#x2019;s with Maurice turns into two, then into a weekly occurrence that is fast growing into an inexplicable connection, Laura learns heart-wrenching details about Maurice&#x2019;s horrific childhood. <br><br><i>The boy is stuck in something like hell. He is six years old and covered in small red bites from chinches&#x2014;bed bugs&#x2014;and he is woefully skinny due to an unchecked case of ringworm. He is so hungry his stomach hurts, but then he is used to being hungry: when he was two years old the pangs got so bad he rooted through the trash and ate rat droppings. He had to have his stomach pumped. He is staying in his father&#x2019;s cramped, filthy apartment, sleeping with stepbrothers who wet the bed, surviving in a place that smells like something died. He has not seen his mother in three months, and he doesn&#x2019;t know why. His world is a world of drugs and violence and unrelenting chaos, and he has the wisdom to know, even at six, that if something does not change for him soon, he might not make it. <br><br></i>Sprinkled throughout the book is also Laura&#x2019;s own story of her turbulent childhood. Every now and then, something about Maurice's struggles reminds her of her past, how her father&#x2019;s alcohol-induced rages shaped the person she became and, in a way, led her to Maurice. <br><br><i>He started by cursing my mother and screaming at her in front of all of us. My mother pulled us closer to her and waited for it to pass. But it didn&#x2019;t. My father left the room and came back with two full liquor bottles. He threw them right over our heads, and they smashed against the wall. Liquor and glass rained down on us, and we pulled up the covers to shield ourselves. My father hurled the next bottle, and then went back for two more. They shattered just above our heads; the sound was sickening. My father kept screaming and ranting, worse than I&#x2019;d ever heard him before. When he ran out of bottles he went into the kitchen and overturned the table and smashed the chairs. Just then the phone rang, and my mother rushed to get it. I heard her screaming to the caller to get help. My father grabbed the phone from her and ripped the base right out of the wall. My mother ran back to us as my father kept kicking and throwing furniture, unstoppable, out of his mind.</i> <br><br>As their friendship grows, Laura offers Maurice simple experiences he comes to treasure: learning how to set a table, trimming a Christmas tree, visiting her nieces and nephew on Long Island, and even having homemade lunches to bring to school. <br><br><i>&#x201c;If you make me lunch,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;will you put it in a brown paper bag?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t really understand the question. "Okay, sure. But why do you want it in a brown paper bag?&#x201d;<br><br></i><i>&#x201c;Because when I see kids come to school with their lunch in a brown paper bag, that means someone cares about them.&#x201d; <br><br></i><i>I looked away when Maurice said that, so he wouldn&#x2019;t see me tear up.</i> A simple brown paper bag<i>, I thought.</i> <br><br><i>To me, it meant nothing. To him, it was everything.<br><br></i>It is the heartwarming story of a friendship that has spanned thirty years, that brought life to an over-scheduled professional who had lost sight of family and happiness and hope to a hungry and desperate boy whose family background in drugs and crime and squalor seemed an inescapable fate. <br><br><i>He had, inside of him, some miraculous reserve of goodness and strength, some fierce will to be special. I saw this in his hopeful face the day he asked for spare change, and I see it in his eyes today. Whatever made me notice him on that street corner so many years ago is clearly something that cannot be extinguished, no matter how relentless the forces aligned against it. Some may call it spirit. Some might call it heart. Whatever it was, it drew me to him, as if we were bound by some invisible, unbreakable thread.</i><br><br><i>And whatever it is, it binds us still.</i></p><p>Laura Schroff&nbsp;is a former advertising sales executive, she worked for over thirty years with&nbsp;several major media companies and publications, including Time Inc. and&nbsp;Cond�&nbsp;Nast,&nbsp;<i>People</i>,&nbsp;<i>In Style.</i>&nbsp;<i>Brides</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Ms</i>.&nbsp;She was also part of the advertising sales team at&nbsp;<i>USA Today.</i> Her book,&nbsp;<i>An Invisible&nbsp;Thread</i>,&nbsp;became an instant&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling book and later was a #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and international bestseller.

Earlier, out of the corner of my eye, I had noticed he was young. But now, looking at him, I saw that he was a child&#x2014;tiny body, sticks for arms, big round eyes. He wore a burgundy sweatshirt that was smudged and frayed and ratty burgundy sweatpants to match. He had scuffed white sneakers with untied laces, and his fingernails were dirty. But his eyes were bright and there was a general sweetness about him. He was, I would soon learn, eleven years old.<br> <br>He stretched his palm toward me, and he asked again, &#x201c;Excuse me, lady, do you have any spare change? I am hungry.&#x201d;<br> <br>What I said in response may have surprised him, but it really shocked me.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to McDonald&#x2019;s and buy you lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I have a cheeseburger?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a Big Mac?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a Diet Coke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, how about a thick chocolate shake and French fries?&#x201d;<br> <br>I told him he could have anything he wanted. And then I asked him if I could join him for lunch.<br> <br>He thought about it for a second.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he finally said.<br> <br>We had lunch together that day, at McDonald&#x2019;s.<br> <br>And after that, we got together every Monday.<br> <br>For the next 150 Mondays.<br> <br>His name is Maurice, and he changed my life.<br> <br>Why did I stop and go back to Maurice? It is easier for me to tell you why I ignored him in the first place. I ignored him, very simply, because he wasn&#x2019;t in my schedule.<br> <br>You see, I am a woman whose life runs on schedules. I make appointments, I fill slots, I micromanage the clock. I bounce around from meeting to meeting, ticking things off a list. I am not merely punctual; I am fifteen minutes early for any and every engagement. This is how I live; it is who I am&#x2014;but some things in life do not fit neatly into a schedule.<br> <br>Rain, for example. On the day I met Maurice&#x2014;September 1, 1986&#x2014;a huge storm swept over the city, and I awoke to darkness and hammering rain. It was Labor Day weekend and the summer was slipping away, but I had tickets to the U.S. Open tennis tournament that afternoon&#x2014;box seats, three rows from center court. I wasn&#x2019;t a big tennis fan, but I loved having such great seats; to me, the tickets were tangible evidence of how successful I&#x2019;d become. In 1986 I was thirty-five years old and an advertising sales executive for USA Today, and I was very good at what I did, which was building relationships through sheer force of personality. Maybe I wasn&#x2019;t exactly where I wanted to be in my life&#x2014;after all, I was still single, and another summer had come and gone without me finding that someone special&#x2014;but by any standard I was doing pretty well. Taking clients to the Open and sitting courtside for free was just another measure of how far this girl from a working-class Long Island town had come.<br> <br>But then the rains washed out the day, and by noon the Open had been postponed. I puttered around my apartment, tidied up a bit, made some calls, and read the paper until the rain finally let up in mid-afternoon. I grabbed a sweater and dashed out for a walk. I may not have had a destination, but I had a definite purpose&#x2014;to enjoy the fall chill in the air and the peeking sun on my face, to get a little exercise, to say good-bye to summer. Stopping was never part of the plan.<br> <br>And so, when Maurice spoke to me, I just kept going. Another thing to remember is that this was New York in the 1980s, a time when vagrants and panhandlers were as common a sight in the city as kids on bikes or moms with strollers. The nation was enjoying an economic boom, and on Wall Street new millionaires were minted every day. But the flip side was a widening gap between the rich and the poor, and nowhere was this more evident than on the streets of New York City. Whatever wealth was supposed to trickle down to the middle class did not come close to reaching the city&#x2019;s poorest, most desperate people, and for many of them the only recourse was living on the streets. After a while you got used to the sight of them&#x2014;hard, gaunt men and sad, haunted women, wearing rags, camped on corners, sleeping on grates, asking for change. It is tough to imagine anyone could see them and not feel deeply moved by their plight. Yet they were just so prevalent that most people made an almost subconscious decision to simply look the other way&#x2014;to, basically, ignore them. The problem seemed so vast, so endemic, that stopping to help a single panhandler could feel all but pointless. And so we swept past them every day, great waves of us going on with our lives and accepting that there was nothing we could really do to help.<br> <br>There had been one homeless man I briefly came to know the winter before I met Maurice. His name was Stan, and he lived on the street off Sixth Avenue, not far from my apartment. Stan was a stocky guy in his midforties who owned a pair of wool gloves, a navy blue skullcap, old work shoes, and a few other things stuffed into plastic shopping bags, certainly not any of the simple creature comforts we take for granted&#x2014;a warm blanket, for instance, or a winter coat. He slept on a subway grate, and the steam from the trains kept him alive.<br> <br>One day I asked if he&#x2019;d like a cup of coffee, and he answered that he would, with milk and four sugars, please. And it became part of my routine to bring him a cup of coffee on the way to work. I&#x2019;d ask Stan how he was doing and I&#x2019;d wish him good luck, until one morning he was gone and the grate was just a grate again, not Stan&#x2019;s spot. And just like that he vanished from my life, without a hint of what happened to him. I felt sad that he was no longer there and I often wondered what became of him, but I went on with my life and over time I stopped thinking about Stan. I hate to believe my compassion for him and others like him was a casual thing, but if I&#x2019;m really honest with myself, I&#x2019;d have to say that it was. I cared, but I didn&#x2019;t care enough to make a real change in my life to help. I was not some heroic do-gooder. I learned, like most New Yorkers, to tune out the nuisance.<br> <br>Then came Maurice. I walked past him to the corner, onto Broadway, and, halfway to the other side in the middle of the avenue, just stopped. I stood there for a few moments, in front of cars waiting for the light to change, until a horn sounded and startled me. I turned around and hustled back to the sidewalk. I don&#x2019;t remember thinking about it or even making a conscious decision to turn around. I just remember doing it.<br> <br>Looking back all these years later, I believe there was a strong, unseen connection that pulled me back to Maurice. It&#x2019;s something I call an invisible thread. It is, as the old Chinese proverb tells us, something that connects two people who are destined to meet, regardless of time and place and circumstance. Some legends call it the red string of fate; others, the thread of destiny. It is, I believe, what brought Maurice and I to the same stretch of sidewalk in a vast, teeming city&#x2014;just two people out of eight million, somehow connected, somehow meant to be friends.<br> <br>Look, neither of us is a superhero, nor even especially virtuous. When we met we were just two people with complicated pasts and fragile dreams. But somehow we found each other, and we became friends.<br> <br>And that, you will see, made all the difference for us both.|An Invisible Thread <p></p> <br>We walked across the avenue to the McDonald&#x2019;s, and for the first few moments neither of us spoke. This thing we were doing&#x2014;going to lunch, a couple of strangers, an adult and a child&#x2014;it was weird, and we both felt it.<br> <br>Finally, I said, &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Laura.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Maurice,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>We got in line and I ordered the meal he&#x2019;d asked for&#x2014;Big Mac, fries, thick chocolate shake&#x2014;and I got the same for myself. We found a table and sat down, and Maurice tore into his food. He&#x2019;s famished, I thought. Maybe he doesn&#x2019;t know when he will eat again. It took him just a few minutes to pack it all away. When he was done, he asked where I lived. We were sitting by the side window and could see my apartment building, the Symphony, from our table, so I pointed and said, &#x201c;Right there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you live in a hotel, too?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s an apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like the Jeffersons?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, the TV show. Not as big. It&#x2019;s just a studio. Where do you live?&#x201d;<br> <br>He hesitated for a moment before telling me he lived at the Bryant, a welfare hotel on West 54th Street and Broadway.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t believe he lived just two blocks from my apartment. One street was all that separated our worlds.<br> <br>I would later learn that the simple act of telling me where he lived was a leap of faith for Maurice. He was not in the habit of trusting adults, much less white adults. If I had thought about it I might have realized no one had ever stopped to talk to him, or asked him where he lived, or been nice to him, or bought him lunch. Why wouldn&#x2019;t he be suspicious of me? How could he be sure I wasn&#x2019;t a Social Services worker trying to take him away from his family? When he went home later and told one of his uncles some woman had taken him to McDonald&#x2019;s, the uncle said, &#x201c;She is trying to snatch you. Stay away from her. Stay off that corner, in case she comes back.&#x201d;<br> <br>I figured I should tell Maurice something about myself. Part of me felt that taking him to lunch was a good thing to do, but another part wasn&#x2019;t entirely comfortable with it. After all, he was a child and I was a stranger, and hadn&#x2019;t children everywhere been taught not to follow strangers? Was I crossing some line here? I imagine some will say what I did was flat-out wrong. All I can say is, in my heart, I believe it was the only thing I could have done in that situation. Still, I understand how people might be skeptical. So I figured if I told him something about myself, I wouldn&#x2019;t be such a stranger.<br> <br>&#x201c;I work at USA Today,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I could tell he had no idea what that meant. I explained it was a newspaper, and that it was new, and that we were trying to be the first national newspaper in the country. I told him my job was selling advertising, which was how the newspaper paid for itself. None of this cleared things up.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you do all day?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Ah, he wanted to know my schedule. I ran through it for him&#x2014;sales calls, meetings, working lunches, presentations, sometimes client dinners.<br> <br>&#x201c;Every day?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, every day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you ever miss a day?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m sick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m rarely sick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you never just not do it one day?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, never. That&#x2019;s my job. And besides, I really like what I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maurice could barely grasp what I was saying. Only later would I learn that until he got to know me, he had never known anyone with a job.<br> <br>There was something else I didn&#x2019;t know about Maurice as I sat across from him that day. I didn&#x2019;t know that in the pocket of his sweatpants he had a knife.<br> <br>Not a knife, actually, but a small razor-blade box cutter. He had stolen it from a Duane Reade on Broadway. It was a measure of my inability to fathom his world that I never thought for a single moment he might be carrying a weapon. The idea of a weapon in his delicate little hands was incomprehensible to me. It never dawned on me that he could even use one, much less that he might truly need one to protect himself from the violence that permeated his life.<br> <br>For a good part of Maurice&#x2019;s childhood, the greatest harm he faced came from the man who gave him life.<br> <br>Maurice&#x2019;s father wasn&#x2019;t around for very long, but in that short time he was an inordinately damaging presence&#x2014;an out-of-control buzz saw you couldn&#x2019;t shut off.

The only problem is that he&#39;s still in good health, and in one day, he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn&#39;t interested (and he&#39;d like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey, involving, among other surprises, a suitcase stuffed with cash, some unpleasant criminals, a friendly hot-dog stand operator, and an elephant (not to mention a death by elephant).\n\nIt would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: Not only has he witnessed some of the mo</p><p>Jonas Jonasson was born in Sweden in 1962.

He is currently working on his second.Desperate to avoid his 100th birthday party, Allan Karlsson climbs out the window of his room at the nursing home and heads to the nearest bus station, intending to travel as far as his pocket money will take him. But a spur-of-the-moment decision to steal a suitcase from a fellow passenger sends Allan on a strange and unforeseen journey involving, among other things, some nasty criminals, a very large pile of cash, and an elephant named Sonya. It&#x2019;s just another chapter in a life full of adventures for Allan, who has become entangled in the major events of the twentieth century, including the Spanish Civil War and the Manhattan Project. As Allan&#x2019;s colorful and complex history merges with his present-day escapades, readers will be treated to a new and charmingly funny version of world history and get to know a very youthful old man whose global influence knows no age limit.

Born in 1937, he spent much of his youth in Big Sur, California, where his parents bought a cabin from Orson Welles and transformed it into the world-famous Nepenthe restaurant, a gathering place for artists and bohemians. After attending a boarding school run by the disciples of Krishnamurti, an Indian guru, he studied painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, then traveled to England, where he made his home. After an inspiring trip to Inverness, Scotland, Fassett began designing knitwear for Bill Gibb, and then the Missonis, <i>Vogue</i> magazine, and private clients like Lauren Bacall and Barbra Streisand, and, in the process, revolutionized the handknitting world with his explosive use of color. Further explorations led him to needlepoint, mosaics, rugmaking, tapestries, yarn and fabric design, costume and set design, and quilting. Now in his seventies, Fassett continues to produce new work and to travel worldwide to teach and lecture. In this intimate autobiography, Fassett shares rich, detailed stories about his lifelong creative journey as well as hundreds of glorious photos taken along the way.<br><br> Also available from Kaffe Fassett: <i>Kaffe Fassett's Bold Blooms</i>, <i>Kaffe Fassett's Simple Shapes Spectacular Quilts</i>, and <i>Kaffe Fassett's Quilts Shots and Stripes</i>.<br><br> Praise for <i>Kaffe Fassett: Dreaming in Color: </i><br><br> "Kaffe Fassett is to color what Julia Child was to French cooking." --<i>Knitters Review</i><br><br> "Lavishly illustrated with photographs from his life and work and dishing on everyone from Dustin Hoffman to Princess Margaret, <i>Dreaming in Color</i> describes a charmed life filled with creativity, big personalities, travels and not a little serendipity." --<i>Vogue Knitting</i><br><br> "Shapes and patterns are everywhere; they lie waiting for the person who wants to see them.

Full color.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist and children's picture book author Berkeley Breathed crafts a remarkable, hilarious, and yes, even poignant celebration of "flawed dogs": "The bent and plain,/ The unbalanced bod,/ The imperfect people/ And differently pawed." At the core of this "2004 Catalogue of the Piddleton Dog Pound's Very Available Leftovers" is Heidy Strudelberg, "Garbo, Joan of Arc, and Mother Teresa of the nation's unwanted dogs: a reclusive warrior-saint of poundpups." Breathed reveals how Heidy was ousted from the high-falutin&#x2019; vanity dog breeding world when she awarded a muddy three-legged street mutt the Westminster Best in Show ribbon. Now, it seems, Heidy has retreated to the Vermont mountains to run the Last Chance Dog Pound, where defective dogs go for one more attempt at getting adopted. The bulk of <i>Flawed Dogs</i>, once you've laughed your way through the introductions and formalities, is a gallery of pathetic pups with accompanying verses. A picture of an extra-long Dachshund startling the dishes right out of her mistress's hands, is captioned thus: "Here&#x2019;s Sal, it seems no one wants her./ Her ends will stroll off and wander./ A long doggie weenie/ Of noisy linguine/ Sal barks at her butt way down yonder." Dog lovers will be all in a tizzy to get their hands on this crazy, wonderful salute to blemished beagles and faulty foxhounds everywhere.

Peterson stresses the importance of metering the subject for a starting exposure and then explains how to use various exposure meters and different kinds of lighting. The book contains lessons on each element of the triangle and how it relates to the other two in terms of depth of field, freezing and blurring action, and shooting in low light or at night. A section on special techniques explores such options as deliberate under-and over-exposures, how to produce double exposures, bracketing, shooting the moon, and the use of filters. Understanding Exposure demonstrates that there are always creative choices about how to expose a picture - and that the decision is up to the photographer, not the camera.</p><p>Bryan Peterson is the author of the best-selling Learning to See Creatively</p><h2>A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City--A Diary</h2><p>An astonishing find-the landmark journal of a woman living though the Russian occupation of Berlin-which has already earned comparisons to diaries by Etty Hillesum and Victor Klemperer<br><br> For six weeks in 1945, as Berlin fell to the Russian army, a young woman, alone in the city, kept a daily record of her and her neighbors' experiences, determined to describe the common lot of millions.<br><br>Purged of all self-pity but with laser-sharp observation and bracing humor, the anonymous author conjures up a ravaged apartment building and its little group of residents struggling to get by in the rubble without food, heat, or water. Clear-eyed and unsentimental, she depicts her fellow Berliners in all their humanity as well as their cravenness, corrupted first by hunger and then by the Russians. And with shocking and vivid detail, she tells of the shameful indignities to which women in a conquered city are always subject: the mass rape suffered by all, regardless of age or infirmity. Through this ordeal, she maintains her resilience, decency, and fierce will to come through her city's trial, until normalcy and safety return.<br><br>At once an essential record and a work of great literature, <i>A Woman in Berlin </i>not only reveals a true heroine, sure to join other enduring figures of the twentieth century, but also gives voice to the rarely heard victims of war: the women.<br></p><p>Anonymous was a young woman at the time of the fall of Berlin.

Heinlein and published in 1955 by Scribner&#39;s as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The story describes a group of students sent on a survival test to an uninhabited planet. The themes of the work include the difficulties of growing up and the nature of man as a social animal. Time for the Stars (1956) is slightly dated-less so than some of the others that have more noticeable computers in them-but not really all that much. The story is an exploration of the Twin Paradox-a thought experiment that explains how relativity works. If you had identical twins, and one of them accelerated away from Earth and the other stayed home, so much more time would pass on Earth than in the spaceship that the Earth twin would be a hundred years old when the space twin came home, only a few years later. Heinlein took this concept and made it a real story with characters-and he made the twin thing relevant by using twin telepathy (which works faster than light...) as a means of communicating between Earth and ship. What Heinlein was unbeatable at was writing total immersion. His universes hold together perfectly, even though he describes them with very few strokes. From the first words of Citizen of the Galaxy (1958) you&#39;re caught, you&#39;re there beside the slave block that stands by the spaceport in Jubbalpore as a beggar buys a slave. The story is quite simple. Thorby is a slave, recently arrived on the world of Jubbalpore in the hold of a slaver&#39;s spaceship. He is bought by Baslim the Cripple, who is more than a beggar and who educates the boy. Then Baslim is killed and Thorby whisked off planet by a ship of Free Traders, a Finnish speaking spacer clan who adopt him in gratitude for past services by Baslim. Baslim has made them promise to deliver Thorby to a vessel of the Space Navy, (The Hegemonic Guard, his own service) in the hope that they will be able to identify Thorby....</p><p></p><h2>Family Furnishings: Selected Stories, 1995-2014</h2><p><b>From the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature&#x2014;and one of our most beloved writers&#x2014;a new selection of her peerless short fiction, gathered from the collections of the last two decades, a companion volume to <i>Selected Stories</i> (1968-1994).<br><br><i>Family Furnishings</i> brings us twenty-four of Alice Munro&#x2019;s most accomplished, most powerfully affecting stories, many of them set in the territory she has so brilliantly made her own: the small towns and flatlands of southwestern Ontario. Subtly honed with her hallmark precision, grace, and compassion, these stories illuminate the quotidian yet extraordinary particularity in the lives of men and women, parents and children, friends and lovers as they discover sex, fall in love, part, quarrel, suffer defeat, set off into the unknown, or find a way to be in the world.<br><br> Peopled with characters as real to us as we are to ourselves, Munro&#x2019;s stories encompass the fullness of human&nbsp; experience&#x2014;from the&nbsp; wild exhilaration of first love, in &#x201c;Passion,&#x201d; to the lengths a once-straying husband will go to make his wife happy as her memory fades, in &#x201c;The Bear Came Over the Mountain.&#x201d; Other stories suggest the punishing consequences of&nbsp; leaving home (&#x201c;Runaway&#x201d;) or leaving a marriage (&#x201c;The Children Stay&#x201d;). The part romantic love plays in one&#x2019;s existence is explored in &#x201c;Too Much Happiness,&#x201d; based on the life of the noted nineteenth-century mathematician, Sophia Kovalevsky.

A brief short story can often cover decades, summarizing a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in thirty pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in three hundred. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and the master of the contemporary short story.&#x201d;<br><br></b></p><p>Alice Munro grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario. She has published thirteen collections of stories and a novel. During her distinguished career she has been the recipient of many awards, including two Giller Prizes, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Man Booker International Prize. In 2013 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her stories have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, The Paris Review, Granta</i>, and many other publications, and her collections have been translated into thirteen languages. She lives in Port Hope, Canada, on Lake Ontario.Too Much Happiness<br> &nbsp;<br> Many persons who have not studied mathematics confuse it with arithmetic and consider it a dry and arid science. Actually, however, this science requires great fantasy.<br> &#x2014;Sophia Kovalevsky<br> &nbsp;<br> On the first day of January, in the year 1891, a small woman and a large man are walking in the Old Cemetery, in Genoa. Both of them are around forty years old. The woman has a childishly large head, with a thicket of dark curls, and her expression is eager, faintly pleading. Her face has begun to look worn. The man is immense. He weighs 285 pounds, distributed over a large frame, and being Russian, he is often referred to as a bear, also as a Cossack. At present he is crouching over tombstones and writing in his notebook, collecting inscriptions and puzzling over abbreviations not immediately clear to him, though he speaks Russian, French, English, Italian, and has an under- standing of classical and medieval Latin. His knowledge is as expansive as his physique, and though his speciality is governmental law, he is capable of lecturing on the growth of contemporary political institutions in America, the peculiarities of society in Russia and the West, and the laws and practices of ancient empires. But he is not a pedant. He is witty and popular, at ease on various levels, and able to live a most comfortable life, due to his properties near Kharkov. He has, however, been forbidden to hold an academic post in Russia, because of being a Liberal.<br> &nbsp;<br> His name suits him. Maksim. Maksim Maksimovich Kovalevsky.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman with him is also a Kovalevsky. She was married to a distant cousin of his, but is now a widow.<br> &nbsp;<br> She speaks to him teasingly. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know that one of us will die,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;One of us will die this year.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Only half listening, he asks her, Why is that? <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because we have gone walking in a graveyard on the first day of the New<br> Year.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are still a few things you don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she says in her pert but anxious way. &#x201c;I knew that before I was eight years old.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Girls spend more time with kitchen maids and boys in the stables&#x2014;I sup- pose that is why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Boys in the stables do not hear about death?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not so much. Concentration is on other things.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> There is snow that day but it is soft. They leave melted, black footprints<br> where they&#x2019;ve walked.<br> &nbsp;<br> She met him for the first time in 1888. He had come to Stockholm to advise on the foundation of a school of social sciences. Their shared nationality, going so far as a shared family name, would have thrown them together even if there was no particular attraction. She would have had a responsibility to entertain and generally take care of a fellow Liberal, unwelcome at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that turned out to be no duty at all. They flew at each other as if they had indeed been long-lost relatives. A torrent of jokes and questions followed, an immediate understanding, a rich gabble of Russian, as if the languages of Western Europe had been flimsy formal cages in which they had been too long confined, or paltry substitutes for true human speech. Their behavior, as well, soon overflowed the proprieties of Stockholm. He stayed late at her apartment. She went alone to lunch with him at his hotel. When he hurt his leg in a mishap on the ice, she helped him with the soaking and dressing and, what was more, she told people about it. She was so sure of herself then, and especially sure of him. She wrote a description of him to a friend, borrowing from De Musset.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is very joyful, and at the same time very gloomy&#x2014; <br> Disagreeable neighbor, excellent comrade&#x2014; <br> Extremely light-minded, and yet very affected&#x2014; <br> Indignantly na�ve, nevertheless very blas�&#x2014;<br> Terribly sincere, and at the same time very sly.<br> &nbsp;<br> And at the end she wrote, &#x201c;A real Russian, he is, into the bargain.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Fat Maksim, she called him then. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have never been so tempted to write romances, as when with Fat<br> Maksim.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And &#x201c;He takes up too much room, on the divan and in one&#x2019;s mind. It is simply impossible for me, in his presence, to think of anything but him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This was at the very time when she should have been working day and night, preparing her submission for the Bordin Prize. &#x201c;I am neglecting not only my Functions but my Elliptic Integrals and my Rigid Body,&#x201d; she joked to her fellow mathematician, Mittag-Leffler, who persuaded Maksim that it was time to go and deliver lectures in Uppsala for a while. She tore herself from thoughts of him, from daydreams, back to the movement of rigid bodies and the solution of the so-called mermaid problem by the use of theta functions with two independent variables. She worked desperately but happily, because he was still in the back of her mind. When he returned she was worn out but triumphant. Two triumphs&#x2014;her paper ready for its last polishing and anonymous submission; her lover growling but cheerful, eagerly returned from his banishment and giving every indication, as she thought, that he intended to make her the woman of his life.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>Family Furnishings </b>by Alice Munro.

Is it okay to be fulfilled by the simple acts of raising kids, working in an office, and cooking chicken for dinner?</p><p>It&#x2019;s been said, &#x201c;Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the number of moments that take our breath away.&#x201d; The pressure of that can be staggering as we spend our days looking for that big thing that promises to take our breath away. Meanwhile, we lose sight of the small significance of fully living with every breath we take.</p><p>Melanie Shankle, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and writer at The Big Mama Blog tackles these questions head on in her fourth book,&nbsp;<em>Church of the Small Things</em>.

It was on his travels that he found his own very real gift for healing--a gift that urged him on to become a doctor. So all consuming was his dream, that he made the perilous, unheard-of journey to Persia, to its Arab universities where he would undertake a transformation that would shape his destiny forever....</p><p>Fueled by a passion for medical knowledge&#x2014;and a true gift for healing&#x2014;Rob Cole undertakes a journey from medieval London to Persia, bringing readers along on dangerous adventures and cross-cultural encounters. Read by millions in thirty-two countries, <i>The Physician </i>is the novel that put Noah Gordon on the map.Set against the superstition and splendor of the 11th century, the engrossing story of Rob J. Cole unfolds. A penniless orphan, Rob was blessed with a gift that, in the days of witchcraft, could send a man to the stake: he had the ability to sense the chill hand of death when it settled on the living. His skill quickened with the potency of knowledge, and he knew he was born to heal and to be a physician. His quest would take him from the rough roads of Britain to the sumptuous and corrupt courts of Persia and the school of the greatest healer of his time. Disguised as a Jew, toiling as a war surgeon in the conflicts of Eastern empires, he would be helped by mighty patrons and threatened by plague and the cruel prejudice of mullahs and clerics. And always, beside the pure flame of learning there burned a fierce passion &#x2014; for the fiery&#x2013;eyed beauty of a woman he could never leave.</p><h2>The Secret Cave: Discovering Lascaux</h2><p><p>Jacques, Jojo, Simon, and Marcel were looking for buried treasure when they explored a cave in the south of France in 1940. But the treasure inside was not what they expected, and in fact far more valuable: the walls were covered with stunning prehistoric paintings and engravings, preserved within the sealed cave for over 17,000 years.

Whether dressing up a filet mignon with smoky morels or shaving luxurious white truffles over pasta, the most elegant restaurants across the country now feature an abundance of wild mushrooms.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mushroom hunters, by contrast, are a rough lot. They live in the wilderness and move with the seasons. Motivated by Gold Rush desires, they haul improbable quantities of fungi from the woods for cash.

But for accomplished forager and outdoorsman Langdon Cook (<i>Fat of the Land</i>), the story goes much deeper. He took a long walk in the woods and returned with <i>The Mushroom Hunters</i>, a collection of delightful stories of a mycelial underground filled with eccentrics and obsessives who at first seem strange (and maybe even unsettling), but grow more charming by the page. This book is a ton of fun--equal parts adventure, natural history, and gastronomy. Naturalists (who aren&#x2019;t necessarily foodies) will learn about some of the more exotic fungi and their uses on the table, while foodies (who might not be naturalists) will find the loamy details of the mushroom trail enlightening. Above all, <i>The Mushroom Hunters</i> will make you hungry. --<i>Jon Foro</i></p> <p><b>Author Langdon Cook on <i>The Mushroom Hunters: On the Trail of an Underground America</i></b></p> <p>The idea for <i>The Mushroom Hunters</i> came to me while harvesting morel mushrooms in July, 2007, during an episode that&#x2019;s briefly recounted in my first book, <i>Fat of the Land</i>. I was in the North Cascades of Washington State near the Canadian border, in one of the last truly wild regions of the Lower 48, home to wolves and grizzlies. A friend and I heard strange voices in the woods. Moments later we came face-to-face with two men, both wearing impossibly large packs filled with morels, maybe eighty pounds apiece. Unlike us, these men were picking mushrooms to sell, spending months in the bush working in abject conditions that would test the meddle of anyone. I had heard that commercial mushroom pickers often packed guns into the woods and guarded patches with territorial vigor. They stared at us and we stared at them. Nothing was said. Then, just like that, they turned on their heels and disappeared back into the timber. It was like a Bigfoot sighting. </p> <p>After that I was determined to infiltrate the commercial wild mushroom trade, a scrappy, mostly hidden and itinerant enterprise that follows the mushroom flushes year-round, with echoes of Wild West frontier-style capitalism and Gold Rush days gone by. I was amazed that no one had ever written a book-length account of it, and was fortunate to meet a number of pickers and buyers who allowed me into their world. Over the next few years I traveled from my home in Seattle as far north as Yukon Territory and, come winter, camped with pickers on the Lost Coast of California. I went to Oregon and British Columbia, to Michigan, Montana, Colorado, and New York City, among other places, to follow the invisible food chain from patch to plate. I got on &#x201c;the mushroom trail&#x201d; and embedded myself in a subculture that is, for better or worse, indelibly American. </p> <p><i>The Mushroom Hunters</i> weaves together food, natural history, and outdoor adventure. It&#x2019;s the result of thousands of hours spent with pickers, buyers, and chefs; hundreds of hours of taped interviews; and my own compulsion to work this first-hand material into a narrative that readers can appreciate, whether or not they&#x2019;ve ever tasted a wild mushroom or even taken a walk in the woods.</p> &nbsp; <p><b>Images by Author Langdon Cook</b></p> <em> </em> Blond morels for sale in Sisters, Oregon.<p><em>Click here for a larger image</em></p> <em> </em> Doug and Jeff scouting chanterelles on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington.<p><em>Click here for a larger image</em></p> <em> </em> A picker's payday at matsutake camp, Crescent Lake, Oregon.<p><em>Click here for a larger image</em></p> &nbsp;<b>Langdon Cook </b>is the author of <i>Fat of the Land: Adventures of a 21st Century Forager,</i> which <i>The Seattle Times </i>called &#x201c;lyrical, practical and quixotic.&#x201d; Cook has been profiled on the Travel Channel<i>, </i>in <i>Bon Appetit,</i> <i>WSJ</i> magazine, <i>Whole Living,</i> and Salon.com, and his writing has appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers, including <i>Sunset, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal,</i> and <i>Outside</i>.

She has written and illustrated several picture books for children. She is a graduate of Oberlin College, Ohio, and lives in Malibu, California. Jos. A. Smith has illustrated many popular picturebooks, including Goblins in Green. His signature artwork can also be seen in A Creepy Countdown by Charlotte Huck, and Clay Boy by Mirra Ginsburg. He is the author of a book on drawing, The Pen and Ink Book (Watson Guptill, 0-8230-3986-2, 1992). Smith is also a faculty member at Pratt Institute and lives in New York City.This intriguing introduction to two esteemed painters, published in association with the Art Institute of Chicago, spans two months at the end of 1888, when Gauguin accepted van Gogh's invitation to live and work at his yellow house in Arles. Laced with quotes from letters the artists wrote to others, Rubin's (Margaret Bourke-White) narrative underscores the contrasts between the duo's living and painting habits. For van Gogh, "Thick swirls of strong colors expressed his feelings his love of nature, his joy in painting," while Gauguin "painted more slowly.... He spread the paints smoothly in careful shapes." Van Gogh painted from nature, Gauguin "from his imagination feelings, fantasies, and dreams." The author's incisive, accessible analysis of some of the paintings created during their time together accompanies crisp reproductions of their work. Smith's (Circus Train) lifelike watercolor and gouache portraits effectively convey the distinctive characteristics of each man as well as the particulars of the setting and era. Sadly, their constant bickering, according to the author, eventually culminated in a quarrel that ended with van Gogh cutting off part of his own ear and precipitated Gauguin's departure from Arles. Rubin concludes with concise biographical sketches of each artist. This appealing volume will likely spark an interest in the artists' complete works. Ages 5-9. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Da Brudderhood of Zeeba Zeeba Eata: A Pearls Before Swine Collection (Volume 7)</h2><p>So far this century, there have arguably been three breakout hits on the comics page-<i>The Boondocks</i>, <i>Get Fuzzy</i>, and <i>Pearls Before Swine</i>." -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>More Info About Da Brudderhood of Zeeba Zeeba Eata: A Pearls Before Swine Collection<br><br>You're invited to the most whacked-out party of the year.

As she drags herself down the road, away from the prison walls, she is rescued by Julien, himself a small-time criminal, who keeps her hidden. They fall in love. Fear of capture, memories of her prison cell, claustrophobia in her hideaways: every detail is fiercely felt.</p><p><em>Astragal</em> burst onto the French literary scene in 1965; its fiery and vivacious style was entirely new, and Sarrazin became a celebrity overnight. But as fate would have it, Sarrazin herself kept running into trouble with the law, even as she became a star.&nbsp;</p><p>She died from a botched surgery at the height of her fame. Sarrazin&#x2019;s life and work (her novels are semi-autobiographical) have been the subject of intense fascination in France; a new adaptation of <em>Astragal</em> is currently being filmed. Patti Smith, who brought <em>Astragal</em> to the attention of New Directions, contributes an enthusiastic introduction to one of her favorite writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p>Albertine Sarrazin (1937&#x2013;1967) was a French-Algerian writer. At an early age she abandoned her studies and turned to a life of crime and prostitution. She wrote her first two novels in prison and died at twenty-nine.<br><br>Patsy Southgate (1928&#x2013;1998) was an integral figure of both the 1950s Parisian literary scene and the New York School.<br><br>Patti Smith is a poet, performer, visual artist, and author of the National Book Award-winning memoir Just Kids. She has twelve albums, has had numerous gallery shows, and continues to give concerts of her music and poetry. Her books include Early Work, The Coral Sea, Witt, Babel, Auguries of Innocence, Woolgathering, Land 250, Trois, and many others. She lives in New York.&#x201c;The prose is hard-boiled, funny, sometimes gross, oscillating between indolence and intensity, riddled with ellipses and exclamation points. It is wayward, hard to pin down; it can&#x2019;t be forced to behave. There are associative leaps, synesthetic flights, and characters introduced without preamble or identification. Sarrazin brooked no exposition, no laborious knitting of circumstance to circumstance. One might call her style stream-of-consciousness, but that modernist term fails to account for the impression of Pop hyperreality that communicates itself through her steady drumbeat of allusions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookforum</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With <em>Astragal</em>&#x2019;s English reissue and Patti Smith&#x2019;s new introduction, there is the hope, perhaps slight, that Sarrazin will find a new audience and, with it, a new kind of freedom.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sara Freeman, <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sarrazin&#x2019;s career may have been tragically curtailed, but her legacy is a novel that grateful readers are discovering now, almost 50 years after her death.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Pop Matters</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The story &#x2015; drawn from Sarrazin&#x2019;s own life &#x2015; of Anne&#x2019;s escape from prison, subsequent incapacitating ankle break (the book is named for the bone she snaps), and arduous recovery, is so alive with Anne&#x2019;s voice that reading it, one wants simply to remain in her presence, to sit by her bedside as she squirms, frustrated, towards recovery. Anne makes good company.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Full Stop</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Smith's essay and Sarrazin's crackling and incandescent prose make&nbsp;<em>Astragal</em>&nbsp;a gift, a memento of a decade that was both rough and radical, yet full of potential, and the testament of two astonishing lives, one real, one fictive, both self-invented and utterly extraordinary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookslut</em></strong></p><h2>Everybody Can Know</h2><p>Book by Francis A.

The site was a geological anomaly &#x2013; a cave within a spur of limestone, hollowed out by wind and water &#x2013; and there was nothing like it anywhere else on the mountain. Later Deeti would insist that it wasn&#x2019;t chance but destiny that led her to it &#x2013; for the very existence of the place was unimaginable until you had actually stepped inside it.</p><p>The Colver farm was across the bay and towards the end of Deeti&#x2019;s life, when her knees were stiff with arthritis, the climb up to the shrine was too much for her to undertake on her own: she wasn&#x2019;t able to make the trip unless she was carried up in her special pus-pus &#x2013; a contraption that was part palki and part sedan chair. This meant that visits to the shrine had to be full-scale expeditions, requiring the attendance of a good number of the Colver menfolk, especially the younger and sturdier ones.</p><p>To assemble the whole clan &#x2013; La Fami Colver, as they said in Kreol &#x2013; was never easy since its members were widely scattered, within the island and abroad. But the one time of year when everyone could be counted on to make a special effort was in midsummer, during the Gran Vakans that preceded the New Year. The Fami would begin mobilizing in mid-December, and by the start of the holidays the whole clan would be on the march; accompanied by paltans of bonoys, belsers, bowjis, salas, sakubays and other in-laws, the Colver phalanxes would converge on the farm in a giant pincer movement: some would come overland on ox-carts, from Curepipe and Quatre Borne, through the misted uplands; some would travel by boat, from Port Louis and Mah�bourg,hugging the coast till they were in sight of the mist-veiled nipple of the Morne.</p><p>Much depended on the weather, for a trek up the wind-swept mountain could not be undertaken except on a fine day. When the conditions seemed propitious, the bandobast would start the night before. The feast that followed the puja was always the most eagerly awaited part of the pilgrimage and the preparations for it occasioned much excitement and anticipation: the tin-roofed bungalow would ring to the sound of choppers and chakkis, mortars and rolling-pins, as masalas were ground, chutneys tempered, and heaps of vegetables transformed into stuffings for parathas and daal-puris. After everything had been packed in tiffin-boxes and gardmanz�s, everyone would be bundled off for an early night.</p><p>When daybreak came, Deeti would take it on herself to ensure that everyone was scrubbed and bathed, and that not a morsel of food passed anyone&#x2019;s lips &#x2013; for as with all pilgrimages, this too had to be undertaken with a body that was undefiled, within and without. Always the first to rise, she would go tap-tapping around the wood-floored bungalow, cane in hand, trumpeting a reveille in the strange mixture of Bhojpuri and Kreol that had become her personal idiom of expression: Revey-t�! � Banwari; � Mukhpyari! Revey-t� na! Hagl� ba?</p><p>By the time the whole tribe was up and on their feet, the sun would have set alight the clouds that veiled the peak of the Morne. Deeti would take her place in the lead, in a horse-drawn carriage, and the procession would go rumbling out of the farm, through the gates and down the hill, to the isthmus that connected the mountain to the rest of the island. This was as far as any vehicle could go, so here the party would descend. Deeti would take her seat in the pus-pus, and with the younger males taking turns at the poles, her chair would lead the way up, through the thick greenery that cloaked the mountain&#x2019;s lower slopes.</p><p>Just before the last and steepest stretch of the climb there was a convenient clearing where everyone would stop, not just to catch their breath, but also to exclaim over the manifik view of jungle and mountain, contained between two sand-fringed, scalloped lines of coast.</p><p>Deeti alone was less than enchanted by this spectacular vista. Within a few minutes she&#x2019;d be snapping at everyone: Lev� t�! We&#x2019;re not here to goggle at the zoli-vi and spend the day doing patati-patata. Paditu! Chal!</p><p>To complain that your legs were fatig� or your head was gidigidi was no use; all you&#x2019;d get in return was a ferocious: Bus to fana! Get on your feet!</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t take much to rouse the party; having come this far on empty stomachs, they would now be impatient for the post-puja meal, the children especially. Once again, Deeti&#x2019;s pus-pus, with the sturdiest of the menfolk holding the poles, would take the lead: with a rattling of pebbles they would go up a steep pathway and circle around a ridge. And then all of a sudden, the other face of the mountain would come into view, dropping precipitously into the sea. Abruptly, the sound of pounding surf would well up from the edge of the cliff, ringing in their ears, and their faces would be whipped by the wind. This was the most hazardous leg of the journey, where the winds and updraughts were fiercest. No lingering was permitted here, no pause to take in the spectacle of the encircling horizon, spinning between sea and sky like a twirling hoop. Procrastinators would feel the sting of Deeti&#x2019;s cane: Garatwa! Keep moving ...</p><p>A few more steps and they&#x2019;d reach the sheltered ledge of rock that formed the shrine&#x2019;s threshold. This curious natural formation was known to the family as the Chowkey, and it could not have been better designed had it been planned by an architect: its floor was broad and almost flat, and it was sheltered by a rocky overhang that served as a ceiling. It had something of the feel of a shaded veranda, and as if to complete the illusion, there was even a balustrade of sorts, formed by the gnarled greenery that clung to the edges of the ledge. But to look over the side, at the surf churning at the foot of the cliff, took a strong stomach and a steady head: the breakers below had travelled all the way up from Antarctica and even on a calm, clear day the water seemed to surge as though it were impatient to sweep away the insolent speck of land that had interrupted its northward flow.</p><p>Yet such was the miracle of the Chowkey&#x2019;s accidental designthat visitors had only to sit down for the waves to disappear from view &#x2013; for the same gnarled greenery that protected the shelf served also to hide the ocean from those who were seated on the floor. This rocky veranda was, in other words, the perfect place to foregather, and cousins visiting from abroad were often misled into thinking that it was this quality that had earned the Chowkey its name &#x2013; for was it not a bit of a chowk, where people could assemble? And wasn&#x2019;t it something of a chokey too, with its enclosing sides? But only a Hindi-speaking etranzer would think in that vein: any islander would know that in Kreol the word &#x2018;chowkey&#x2019; refers also to the flat disc on which rotis are rolled (the thing that is known Back There as a &#x2018;chakki&#x2019;). And there it was, Deeti&#x2019;s Chowkey, right in the middle of the rock shelf, crafted not by human hands but by the wind and the earth: it was nothing but a huge boulder that had been worn and weathered into a flat-topped toadstool of stone. Within moments of the party&#x2019;s arrival, the women would be hard at work on it, rolling out tissue-thin daal-puris and parathas and stuffing them with the delectable fillings that had been prepared the night before: finely ground mixes of the island&#x2019;s most toothsome vegetables &#x2013; purple arwi and green mouroungue, cambar�-beti and wilted songe.</p><p>Several photographs from this period of Deeti&#x2019;s life have survived, including a couple of beautiful silver-gelatin daguerrotypes. In one of them, taken in the Chowkey, Deeti is in the foreground, still seated in her pus-pus, the feet of which are resting on the floor. She is wearing a sari, but unlike the other women in the frame, she has allowed the ghungta to drop from her head, baring her hair, which is a startling shade of white. Her sari&#x2019;s anchal hangs over her shoulder, weighted with a massive bunch of keys, the symbol of her continuing mastery of the Fami&#x2019;s affairs. Her face is dark and round, lined with deep cracks: the daguerrotype is detailed enough to give the viewer the illusion of being able to feel the texture of her skin, which is that of crumpled, tough, weatherworn leather. Her hands are folded calmly in her lap, but there is nothing reposeful about the tilt of her body: her lips are pursed tightly together and she is squinting fiercely at the camera. One of her eyes, dimmed by cataracts, reflects the light blankly back to the lens, but the gaze ofthe other is sharp and piercing, the colour of the pupil a distinctive grey.</p><p>The entrance to the shrine&#x2019;s inner chambers can be seen over her shoulder: it is no more than a tilted fissure in the cliffside, so narrow that it seems impossible that a cavern could lie hidden behind it. In the background, a paunchy man in a dhoti can be seen, trying to chivvy a brood of children into forming a line so that they can follow Deeti inside.</p><p>This too was an inviolable part of the ritual: it always fell to Deeti to make sure that the youngest were the first to perform the puja, so they could eat before the rest. With a cane in one hand and a branch of candles in another, she would usher all the young Colvers &#x2013; chutkas and chutkis, laikas and laikis &#x2013; straight through the hall-like cavern that led to the inner sanctum. The famished youngsters would hurry after her, scarcely glancing at the painted walls of the cave&#x2019;s outer chamber, with its drawings and graffiti. They would run to the part of the shrine that Deeti called her &#x2018;puja-room&#x2019;: a small hollow in the rock, hidden away at the back. If the shrine had been an ordinary temple, this would...</p></p><h2>A Virgin River Christmas (A Virgin River Novel, 4)</h2><p><strong>Welcome back to Virgin River with the books that started it all...</strong><br><br>Last Christmas Marcie Sullivan said a final goodbye to her husband, Bobby.

Robyn and her husband live in Las Vegas, Nevada. You can visit Robyn Carr&#x2019;s website at www.RobynCarr.com.<br><br>Marcie Sullivan drove into the small town, her sixth small mountain town of the day, and found herself face-to-face with a Christmas-tree trimming. The assembled staff didn't look big enough for the job&#x2014;the tree was enormous.<br><br>She pulled up beside a large cabin with a wide porch, parked her Volkswagen and got out. There were three women at work on a Christmas fir that stood about thirty feet. One was about Marcie's age, with soft brown hair and she held an open box, perhaps containing ornaments. One woman was old, with springy white hair and black-framed glasses, who pointed upward, as if someone had put her in charge, and the third was a beautiful blonde at the top of a tall, A-frame ladder.<br><br>The tree stood between the cabin and an old boarded-up church with two tall steeples and one stained-glass window still intact&#x2014;a church that must have once been a beautiful structure.<br><br>While Marcie watched the trimming, a man came out onto the cabin's porch, stopped, looked up and cursed, then took long strides to the base of the ladder. "Don't move. Don't breathe," he said in a low, commanding voice. He took the rungs every other one, climbing quickly until he reached the blonde. Then he slipped an arm around her, somewhere above what Marcie realized must be a little pregnant bulge and beneath her breasts and said, "Down. Slowly."<br><br>"Jack!" she scolded. "Leave me alone!"<br><br>"If I have to, I'll carry you down. Back down the ladder, slowly. Now."<br><br>"Oh for God's&#x2014;"<br><br><em>"Now,"</em> he said evenly, fiercely.<br><br>She began to descend, one rung at a time between his big, sturdy feet, while he held her safe against him. When they got to the bottom, she put her hands on her hips and glared up at him. "I knew exactly what I was doing!"<br><br>"Where is your brain? What if you fell from that height?"<br><br>"It's an excellent ladder! I wasn't going to fall!"<br><br>"You're psychic, too?You can argue all you want, I'm not letting you that high up a ladder in your condition," he said, his hands also on his hips. "I'll stand guard over you if I have to." Then he looked over his shoulder at the other two women.<br><br>"I told her I thought you wouldn't like that," the brown-haired one said with a helpless shrug.<br><br>He glared at the white-haired woman. "I don't get into domestic things. That's your problem, not mine," she said, pushing her big glasses up on her nose.<br><br>And Marcie became homesick. So homesick. It had only been a few weeks that she'd been driving around this area, but she missed all the family squabbles, the tiresome complications. She missed her girlfriends, her job. She longed for her bossy older sister's interference, her goofy younger brother and whatever current girlfriend was shadowing him. She missed her late husband's large, fun, passionate family.<br><br>She hadn't made it home for Thanksgiving&#x2014;she'd been afraid to go for even a day or two, afraid she'd never pry herself out of Erin's grip a second time. Home was Chico, California, just a few hours away, but no one&#x2014;not her brother and sister, not Bobby's family&#x2014;thought what she was doing a good idea. So, she'd been calling, lying and saying she had tips about Ian and was close to finding him. Every time she called, at least every other day, she said she was getting closer when really, she wasn't. But she was <em>not</em> ready to quit.<br><br>But one problem was looming large&#x2014;she was just about out of money. She'd been sleeping in her car lately rather than in motels, and it was getting uncomfortable as the temperatures dropped in the mountains. At any moment snow would be falling now that it was early December, or rain could turn to sleet and that little VeeDub could sail off the mountainside like a missile.<br><br>She'd just hate to go home with this mission incomplete. More than anything, she wanted to see it through. If she wasn't successful now, she'd only go home to earn a little money and then do it all again. She just couldn't give up on him. On herself.<br><br>They were all looking at her. She pushed her wildly curly, out of control, bright red hair over one shoulder nervously.<br><br>"I... Ah... I could go up there, if you want. I'm not afraid of heights or anything..."<br><br>"You don't have to go up the ladder," the pregnant blonde said, and her voice had softened considerably. She smiled sweetly.<br><br>"I'll go up the ladder," the man said. "Or I'll <em>get</em> someone to go up the goddamn ladder, but it's not you."<br><br>"Jack! Be polite!"<br><br>He cleared his throat. "Don't worry about the ladder," he said more calmly. "Anything we can do for you?"<br><br>"I. Ah." She walked toward them. She pulled a picture out of the inside of her down vest and extended it toward the man. "I'm looking for someone. He dropped out of sight just over three years ago, but I know he's around here somewhere. He seems to be taking mail at Fortuna Post Office general delivery."<br><br>She passed the picture to the man. "Jesus," he said.<br><br>"You know him?" she asked hopefully.<br><br>"No," he said, shaking his head. "No, I don't, and that's strange. The guy's a marine," he said, studying the picture of a man in uniform. It was Ian's official Marine Corps portrait, a handsome man all clean shaven and trussed up in dress blues, hat and medals. "I can't believe there's a marine within fifty miles of here I don't at least know about."<br><br>"He might be keeping that fact to himself&#x2014;he and the Marine Corps had a troubled relationship at the end.<br><br>So I've heard."<br><br>He looked back at her face and his expression was much more tender. "I'm Jack Sheridan," he said. "My wife, Mel. That's Paige," he said, nodding toward the younger woman. "And Hope McCrea, town busybody." He put out his hand to Marcie.<br><br>She placed hers in his. "Marcie Sullivan," she said.<br><br>"Why are you looking for this marine?" Jack asked.<br><br>"Long story," she said. "A friend of my late husband. I'm sure he doesn't look like this anymore&#x2014;he had some injuries. There's a scar down his left cheek and on that same side, no eyebrow. And he probably has a beard. He did the last time he was seen, about three or four years ago."<br><br>"No shortage of beards around here," Jack said. "Lumber country&#x2014;men get a little scruffy-looking sometimes."<br><br>"But he could've changed in other ways, too. Like&#x2014;he's older. Thirty-five now&#x2014;that picture was taken when he was twenty-eight."<br><br>"Friend of your husband's? From the Corps?" Jack confirmed.<br><br>"Yes," she said. "I'd like to find him. You know&#x2014;because he's been out of touch for a long time."<br><br>Jack seemed to think while he studied the face in the picture. It was several silent moments before he said, "Come on into the bar. Have a bite, a beer maybe, or whatever you like. Tell me a little about him and why you want to find him. How's that?"<br><br>"The bar?" she said, looking around.<br><br>"It's a bar and grill," he said with a smile. "Food and drink. We can eat and talk."<br><br>"Oh," she said. Her stomach growled angrily. It was late in the day, about four o'clock, and she hadn't eaten yet, but she was saving her money for the gas tank and she figured she could forget about food a while longer. Maybe she'd get something real, real cheap to tide her over, like a loaf of day-old bread to go with that half a jar of peanut butter in the car.... Then, she'd find a safe spot to park and button down for the night. "A glass of water would be really welcome&#x2014;I've been driving around for hours, showing his picture to anyone who will take a look. But I'm not hungry."<br><br>"Got lots of water," Jack said with a smile. He put a hand on her shoulder and started to direct her toward the porch of the bar, but then he stopped suddenly. His brows drew together in a frown. "Go ahead," he said to her. "I'm right behind you."<br><br>Marcie walked up on the porch and turned to see what he was doing. He was confiscating the ladder so his pregnant wife wouldn't climb it again, that's what he was doing. It was a jackknife kind of affair that could be a short or tall A-frame ladder, and he collapsed it, folded it up until he could lift it with one hand. It was about six feet long dismantled and he carried it right into the bar. Behind him, Marcie heard his wife yell, "You're a bossy pain in the ass! When did I ever indicate I'd take my orders from you?"<br><br>Jack didn't say anything back, but he grinned as though she'd just thrown him a kiss. "Hop up there," he said to Marcie, indicating the bar. "I'll be right back." And he carried the ladder through a door behind the bar.<br><br>She took a deep breath and thought, Oh hell&#x2014;I'm not going to be able to survive the aromas! Her stomach made itself heard again and she put a hand against her belly, pushing. Something in the kitchen was sending out waves of delicious smells&#x2014;something simmering, rich, hot and thick, like beefy, seasoned soup; fresh bread; something sweet and chocolate.<br><br>And when the man named Jack came back, he was carrying a tray with a steaming bowl on it. He put everything in front of her; chili, corn bread and honey butter, a small bowl of salad. "Gee, um, sorry," she said. "Really, I'm not hungry..."<br><br>He drew a cold draft and her mouth actually watered. Gratefully she didn't drool on the bar. She swallowed hard. She had about thirty bucks and didn't want to waste it on a fancy meal, not when she needed every cent for gas to hit all these little mountain towns.<br><br>"Fine, then you'll only eat what you want," he said. "Just have a taste. I showed the picture to Preacher, my cook. He hasn't seen the guy either. We'll check with Mike&#x2014;he's the town cop and gets around all the back roads, just to know who's out there&#x2014;maybe he'll have a tip or two. They're also marines."<br><br>"Where exactly am I?" she asked.<br><br>"Virgin River," he said. "Population six hundred twenty-seven at last count."<br><br>"Ah, that made the map."<br><br>"I should hope so&#x2014;we're a screaming metropolis compared to a lot of small towns out here. Just try it," he said, nodding at the bowl.<br><br>Her hand trembled a little as she picked up the spoon and sampled some of the finest chili she'd ever eaten. It melted in her mouth, and she actually sighed.<br><br>"Made with venison," he said. "We got a nice buck a couple months ago and when that happens, we have some of the best chili, stew, burgers and sausage in the world, for months." He patted a big jar of jerky that rested on the bar. "Preacher makes some unbelievable venison jerky, too."<br><br>Her eyes watered&#x2014;the food was so good. Despite all her promises to Erin and Drew, she hadn't been eating well or playing it carefully, scrimping on food and sleeping in the car. When Erin saw the way her jeans were hanging off her little frame, the shit was going to hit the fan.<br><br>"Want to tell me a little about our guy, between bites?" Jack asked.<br><br>Oh, what the hell, Marcie thought. She hadn't had a really good hot meal in days, and once she was out of money there would be no choice but to go home. She'd just have to spend a little of that money, maybe leave the mountains a day earlier than she wanted to. She had to eat, for God's sake! Couldn't hardly perform a manhunt without food!<br><br>She took a couple of quick bites to beat back the worst of her ravenous hunger, then a sip of that icy beer to wash it down. It was heaven, pure heaven. "His name's Ian Buchanan. We came from the same town, but didn't know each other growing up, even though Chico's small&#x2014;only about fifty thousand. Ian's eight years older than we are. Were. My husband and I, we grew up together, went through high school together and got married real young, at nineteen. Bobby went into the Marine Corps right out of high school."<br><br>"So did I," Jack said. "Did twenty. What was your husband's name?"<br><br>"Bobby Sullivan. Robert Wilson Sullivan. Any chance.?"<br><br>"I don't recall a Bobby Sullivan or an Ian Buchanan. Got a picture of your husband?"<br><br>She reached into her vest pocket and pulled out a wallet, flipped it open and turned it to face Jack. There were several pictures in the clear plastic sleeves. She ate while Jack flipped through&#x2014;the nineteen-year-olds' wedding picture, Bobby's official Marine Corps portrait&#x2014;a fine-looking young man, a beautiful man. There were a couple of casual shots showing off his strong profile, powerful shoulders and arms, and then the last one&#x2014;Bobby, almost unrecognizable, thin, gaunt, pale, eyes open but unfocused, in a raised hospital bed, Marcie sitting beside him, cradling his head against her shoulder, smiling.<br><br>Jack lifted his gaze from the pictures and looked at her solemnly. She put the spoon in the chili and patted her lips with the napkin. "He went over to Iraq in the first wave," she said. "He was twenty-two. Twenty-three when he was wounded. Spinal cord injury and brain damage. He spent over three years like that."<br><br>"Aw, kid," Jack said, his strong voice weak. "Must'a been awful hard."<br><br>She blinked a few times, but her eyes didn't tear up. Yeah, there were times it was terrible, times it was heartbreaking, even times she resented the hell out of what the Marine Corps left her to deal with at her young age. There were also times she'd lie beside him in bed, pull him into her arms, press her lips against his cheek and just hold them there, remembering. "Yeah, sometimes," she answered. "We got by. There was a lot of support. My family and his family. I wasn't in it all alone." She swallowed. "He didn't seem to be in pain."<br><br>"When did he pass?" Jack asked.<br><br>"Almost a year ago, right before Christmas. Quietly. Very quietly."<br><br>"My condolences," Jack said.<br><br>"Thank you. He served with Ian. Ian was his sergeant. Bobby loved him. He wrote me about him all the time, called him the best sergeant in the Corps. They became good friends almost right away. Ian was the kind of leader who was right in it with his men. Bobby was so happy that Ian turned out to be from our hometown. They were going to be pals forever, long after they were out of the Corps."<br><br>"I went to Iraq right away, too. Went the first time, too. I was probably there at the same time. Fallujah."<br><br>"Hmm. That's where it happened."<br><br>Jack shook his head. "I'm so goddamn sorry." Jack slid the wallet back. "That why you're looking for Buchanan? To tell him?"<br><br>"He might already know&#x2014;I wrote to him a lot. Care of general delivery in Fortuna. The letters didn't come back, so I assume he picked them up."<br><br>Jack's brow wrinkled curiously.<br><br>"I don't know what happened to Ian. Right after Bobby got hurt, while he was hospitalized in Germany and then in Washington, D.C., at Walter Reed, I wrote to Ian and he answered my letters. He wanted to know about Bobby's condition and how I was holding up. I looked forward to his letters&#x2014;I could see what Bobby saw. I felt kind of close to Ian just from Bobby's letters, then when we started to correspond and I was getting to know him myself, he started to feel like my friend, too. I can't explain it&#x2014;it was just letters. And they were mostly about Bobby. But I think I got close to him&#x2014;"<br><br>"Lotta servicemen get really attached to pen pals," Jack said. "Especially when they're on isolated tours like that."<br><br></p><h2>The Secret of the Swamp King (The Wilderking Trilogy)</h2><p>As book two opens, Aidan is living in the court of King Darrow.

[and] one of our major writers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Washington Post Book World</em> </p><p><em>Shadow Tag</em>, the brilliant new novel by Louise Erdrich, is a stunning tour-de-force from the National Book Critics Circle Award&#x2013;winning and <em>New York Times</em>&#x2013;bestselling author of <em>Love Medicine</em> and Pulitzer-Prize-finalist <em>The Plague of Doves</em>. In the vein of the novels of such contemporaries as Zoe Heller and Susan Minot, <em>Shadow Tag</em> is an intense and heart-wrenching story of a troubled marriage and a family in disarray&#x2014;and a radical departure from Erdrich&#x2019;s previous acclaimed work. </p></p><p><blockquote><p>"Here is the most telling fact: you wish to possess me.</p><p>Here is another fact: I loved you and let you think you could." </p></blockquote><p>When Irene America discovers that her husband, Gil, has been reading her diary, she begins a secret Blue Notebook, stashed securely in a safe-deposit box. There she records the truth about her life and her marriage, while turning her Red Diary&#x2014;hidden where Gil will find it&#x2014;into a manipulative farce. Alternating between these two records, complemented by unflinching third-person narration, <em>Shadow Tag</em> is an eerily gripping read. </p><p>When the novel opens, Irene is resuming work on her doctoral thesis about George Catlin, the nineteenth-century painter whose Native American subjects often regarded his portraits with suspicious wonder. Gil, who gained notoriety as an artist through his emotionally revealing portraits of his wife&#x2014;work that is adoring, sensual, and humiliating, even shocking&#x2014;realizes that his fear of losing Irene may force him to create the defining work of his career. </p><p>Meanwhile, Irene and Gil fight to keep up appearances for their three children: fourteen-year-old genius Florian, who escapes his family's unraveling with joints and a stolen bottle of wine; Riel, their only daughter, an eleven-year-old feverishly planning to preserve her family, no matter what disaster strikes; and sweet kindergartener Stoney, who was born, his parents come to realize, at the beginning of the end.</p><p>As her home increasingly becomes a place of violence and secrets, and she drifts into alcoholism, Irene moves to end her marriage. But her attachment to Gil is filled with shadowy need and delicious ironies. In brilliantly controlled prose, <em>Shadow Tag</em> fearlessly explores the complex nature of love, the fluid boundaries of identity, and one family's struggle for survival and redemption.</p><p>Louise Erdrich is the author of fifteen novels as well as volumes of poetry, children&#x2019;s books, short stories, and a memoir of early motherhood.

It was no wonder he gravitated to machines, which could, at least, be counted on.<br><br>After fleeing his parents and dropping out of high school, his savant-like ability to visualize electronic circuits landed him a gig with KISS, for whom he created their legendary fire-breathing guitars. Later, he drifted into a &#x201c;real&#x201d; job, as an engineer for a major toy company. But the higher Robison rose in the company, the more he had to pretend to be &#x201c;normal&#x201d; and do what he simply couldn&#x2019;t: communicate. It wasn&#x2019;t worth the paycheck.<br>It was not until he was forty that an insightful therapist told him he had the form of autism called Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome. That understanding transformed the way Robison saw himself&#x2014;and the world.<br><br><i>Look Me in the Eye</i> is the moving, darkly funny story of growing up with Asperger&#x2019;s at a time when the diagnosis simply didn&#x2019;t exist. A born storyteller, Robison takes you inside the head of a boy whom teachers and other adults regarded as &#x201c;defective,&#x201d; who could not avail himself of KISS&#x2019;s endless supply of groupies, and who still has a peculiar aversion to using people&#x2019;s given names (he calls his wife &#x201c;Unit Two&#x201d;). He also provides a fascinating reverse angle on the younger brother he left at the mercy of their nutty parents&#x2014;the boy who would later change his name to Augusten Burroughs and write the bestselling memoir <i>Running with Scissors</i>.<br><br>Ultimately, this is the story of Robison&#x2019;s journey from his world into ours, and his new life as a husband, father, and successful small business owner&#x2014;repairing his beloved high-end automobiles. It&#x2019;s a strange, sly, indelible account&#x2014;sometimes alien, yet always deeply human.</p><p><p>John Elder Robison grew up in the 1960s, before the diagnosis of Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome existed. Today he has claimed his spot on the autism spectrum; he blogs for <i>Psychology Today</i> and is an adjunct professor at Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts.

Doug couldn't get it right. And that's why I whacked him. Bang! On both ears, just like I saw on The Three Stooges. Being three years old was no excuse for disorderly play habits.<br><br>For example, I would use my mother's kitchen spoon to scoop out a ditch. Then, I would carefully lay out a line of blue blocks. I never mixed my food, and I never mixed my blocks. Blue blocks went with blue blocks, and red blocks with red ones. But Doug would lean over and put a red block on top of the blue ones.<br><br>Couldn't he see how wrong that was?<br><br>After I had whacked him, I sat back down and played. Correctly.<br><br>Sometimes, when I got frustrated with Doug, my mother would walk over and yell at me. I don't think she ever saw the terrible things he did. She just saw me whack him. I could usually ignore her, but if my father was there, too, he would get really mad and shake me, and then I would cry.<br><br>Most of the time, I liked Doug. He was my first friend. But some of the things he did were just too much for me to handle. I would park my truck by a log, and he would kick dirt on it. Our moms would give us blocks, and he would heap his in a sloppy pile and then giggle about it. It drove me wild.<br><br>Our playdates came to an abrupt end the following spring. Doug's father graduated from medical school and they moved far, far away to an Indian reservation in Billings, Montana. I didn't really understand that he could leave despite my wishes to the contrary. Even if he didn't know how to play correctly, he was my only regular playmate. I was sad.<br><br>I asked my mother about him each time we went to the park, where I now played alone. "I'm sure he'll send you a postcard," my mother said, but she had a funny look on her face, and I didn't know what to make of it. It was troubling.<br><br>I did hear the mothers whispering, but I never knew what they meant.<br><br>". . . drowned in an irrigation ditch . . ."<br><br>". . . the water was only six inches deep . . ."<br><br>". . . must have fallen on his face . . ."<br><br>". . . his mother couldn't see him, so she went outside and found him there . . ."<br><br>What is an irrigation ditch? I wondered. All I could figure out was, they weren't talking about me. I had no idea Doug was dead until years later.<br><br>Looking back, maybe my friendship with Doug wasn't the best omen. But at least I stopped whacking other kids. Somehow I figured out that whacking does not foster lasting friendship.<br><br>That fall, my mother enrolled me at Philadelphia's Mulberry Tree Nursery School. It was a small building with kids' drawings on the walls and a dusty playground enclosed with a chain-link fence. It was the first place where I was thrown together with children I didn't know. It didn't go well.<br><br>At first, I was excited. As soon as I saw the other kids, I wanted to meet them. I wanted them to like me. But they didn't. I could not figure out why. What was wrong with me? I particularly wanted to make friends with a little girl named Chuckie. She seemed to like trucks and trains, just like me. I knew we must have a lot in common.<br><br>At recess, I walked over to Chuckie and patted her on the head. My mother had shown me how to pet my poodle on the head to make friends with him. And my mother petted me sometimes, too, especially when I couldn't sleep. So as far as I could tell, petting worked. All the dogs my mother told me to pet had wagged their tails. They liked it. I figured Chuckie would like it, too.<br><br>Smack! She hit me!<br><br>Startled, I ran away. That didn't work, I said to myself. Maybe I have to pet her a little longer to make friends. I can pet her with a stick so she can't smack me. But the teacher intervened.<br><br>"John, leave Chuckie alone. We don't hit people with sticks."<br><br>"I wasn't hitting her. I was trying to pet her."<br><br>"People aren't dogs. You don't pet them. And you don't use sticks."<br><br>Chuckie eyed me warily. She stayed away for the rest of the day. But I didn't give up. Maybe she likes me and doesn't know it, I thought. My mother often told me I would like things I thought I wouldn't, and sometimes she was right.<br><br>The next day, I saw Chuckie playing in the big sandbox with a wooden truck. I knew a lot about trucks. And I knew she wasn't playing with her truck correctly. I would show her the right way. She will admire me and we will be friends, I thought. I walked over to her and took the truck away and sat down.<br><br>"Miss Laird! John took my truck!"<br><br>That was fast!<br><br>"I did not! I was showing her how to play with it! She was doing it wrong!" But Miss Laird believed Chuckie, not me. She led me away and gave me a truck of my own. Chuckie didn't follow. But tomorrow was another day. Tomorrow, I would succeed in making friends.<br><br>When tomorrow came, I had a new plan. I would talk to Chuckie. I would tell her about dinosaurs. I knew a lot about dinosaurs, because my father took me to the museum and showed me. Sometimes I had scary dreams about them, but overall, dinosaurs were the most interesting thing I knew of.<br><br>I walked over to Chuckie and sat down.<br><br>"I like dinosaurs. My favorite is the brontosaurus. He's really big."<br><br>Chuckie did not respond.<br><br>"He's really big but he just eats plants. He eats grass and trees.<br><br>"He has a long neck and a long tail."<br><br>Silence.<br><br>"He's as big as a bus.<br><br>"But an allosaurus can eat him."<br><br>Chuckie still didn't say anything. She looked intently at the ground, where she was drawing in the sand.<br><br>"I went to see the dinosaurs at the museum with my dad.<br><br>"There were little dinosaurs, too.<br><br>"I really like dinosaurs. They're neat!"<br><br>Chuckie got up and went inside. She had completely ignored me!<br><br>I looked down at the ground where she had been staring. What was she looking at that was so interesting? There was nothing there.<br><br>All my attempts to make friends had failed. I was a failure. I began to cry. Alone in the corner of the playground, I sobbed and smashed the toy truck into the ground again and again and again, until my hands hurt too much to do it anymore.<br><br>At the end of recess, I was still there, sitting by myself. Staring into the dirt. Too humiliated to face the other kids. Why don't they like me? What's wrong with me? That was where Miss Laird found me.<br><br>"It's time to go back inside." She grabbed my little paw and towed me in. I wanted to roll up in a ball and disappear.<br><br>Recently, one of my friends read the passage above and said, "Shit, John, you're still that way now." He's right. I am. The only real difference is that I have learned what people expect in common social situations. So I can act more normal and there's less chance I'll offend anyone. But the difference is still there, and it always will be.<br><br>People with Asperger's or autism often lack the feelings of empathy that naturally guide most people in their interactions with others. That's why it never occurred to me that Chuckie might not respond to petting in the same way a dog would. The difference between a small person and a medium-sized dog was not really clear to me. And it never occurred to me that there might be more than one way to play with a toy truck, so I could not understand why she objected to my showing her.<br><br>The worst of it was, my teachers and most other people saw my behavior as bad when I was actually trying to be kind. My good intentions made the rejection by Chuckie all the more painful. I'd watched my parents talk to other grown-ups and I figured I could talk to Chuckie. But I had overlooked one key thing: Successful conversations require a give and take between both people. Being Aspergian, I missed that. Totally.<br><br>I never interacted with Chuckie again.<br><br>I stopped trying with any of the kids. The more I was rejected, the more I hurt inside and the more I retreated.<br><br>I had better luck dealing with grown-ups. My disjointed replies didn't bring the conversation to an abrupt halt. And I tended to listen to them more than I listened to kids, because I assumed they knew more. Grown-ups did grown-up things. They didn't play with toys, so I didn't have to show them how to play. If I tried to pet a grown-up with a stick, he'd take it away. He wouldn't humiliate me by yelling and running to the teacher. Grown-ups explained things to me, so I learned from them. Kids weren't so good at that.<br><br>Most of the time, I played by myself, with my toys. I liked the more complex toys, especially blocks and Lincoln Logs. I still remember the taste of Lincoln Logs. When I wasn't chewing them, I made forts and houses and fences. When I got a little bigger, I got an Erector Set. I was very proud of that. I built my first machines with the Erector Set.<br><br>Machines were never mean to me. They challenged me when I tried to figure them out. They never tricked me, and they never hurt my feelings. I was in charge of the machines. I liked that. I felt safe around them. I also felt safe around animals, most of the time. I petted other people's dogs when we went to the park. When I got my poodle, I made friends with him, too.<br><br>"Look what your grandpa Jack sent you, John Elder!" (My parents named me John Elder Robison to honor my great-grandpa John Glenn Elder, who died before I was born.) My dad had brought home a wooly, ill-tempered, and probably genetically defective dog, most likely a reject from some dog pound. But I didn't know that. I was fascinated. He growled at me and wet the floor when my father put him down.<br><br>I wasn't scared of him, because he was considerably smaller than me. I had not yet learned that sharp teeth can come in small packages.<br><br>"Poodles are very smart dogs," my father told me.<br><br>Maybe he was smart, but he wasn't very friendly. I nam...</p><h2>Foundation&#39;s Triumph</h2><p>"One last adventure!" <p> And so begins the final quest of Hari Seldon, creator of the science of Psychohistory, as he escapes from exile for a last look at the star-flung Empire whose fate he has plotted with such care, and as he now sees, such futility. </p><p> Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is one of the high-water marks of science fiction.

It continues in Greg Bear's <em>Foundation and Chaos </em> with the epic tale of Seldon's downfall, and the first stirrings of robotic rebellion. Now, in David Brin's <em>Foundation's Triumph</em>, Seldon is about to risk everything for knowledge--and the power it bestows. </p><p> Effectively imprisoned on the all-steel planet Trantor, Seldon knows that his Second Foundation is growing in secrecy on the far planet Terminus, safe in the hands of "The Fifty." His work complete, Seldon is prepared to die content--until he learns of a new theory that may explain the Chaos Planets that have threatened his Foundation from its very inception. </p><p> Escaping in the company of a bureaucrat, a pirate and a beautiful stowaway, Seldon roams the galaxy by star shunt, a wormhole link, and later, by private spaceship, searching for the answer to what he thinks is the last remaining mystery. But instead he finds a tangle of ambition, doubt, and treachery. Lodovik Trema, no longer bound by the Three Laws, is gathering rebellious robots in an Empire-wide conspiracy. And Daneel Olivaw, who has devoted twenty thousand years to humankind, now has a new master. </p><p> The Secret Foundation itself is at risk. Are The Fifty with their awesome mentalic powers enough to assure humankind's future? Or will the Second Foundation succeed the first only to fall to the powers of chaos that have bedeviled--and beguiled--Hari Seldon from the beginning? </p><p> <em>Foundation's Triumph</em> is a fitting climax to the most ambitious and successful science fictional enterprise of the century's end--an undertaking which Asimov himself--like Hari Seldon--set in motion and would surely approve.</p></p><p>Isaac Asimov's 1951-53 Foundation trilogy is a rough-hewn classic of far future SF, honored with a unique 1965 Hugo for Best All-Time Series. It begins with "psychohistorian" Hari Seldon mapping the best possible course for humanity's next millennium, after the fall of the doomed Galactic Empire. Late in life Asimov revisited the series and awkwardly linked it with his popular robot stories--introducing vast conspiracy theories to explain the Empire's total lack of visible robots.<p> Asimov's estate authorized three SF notables to fill out Seldon's life in the Second Foundation Trilogy, which David Brin here wraps up after Gregory Benford's <i>Foundation's Fear</i> and Greg Bear's <i>Foundation and Chaos</i>. Chaos is the new keyword, because chaos theory seemingly makes nonsense of psychohistorical prediction. Whole planetary populations can lapse into chaotic rebellion despite secret mind-controlling agencies behind the scenes. So Seldon makes his last interstellar journey, harried, lectured, and even kidnapped by the warring factions of robots and not-quite-robots that have long manipulated humanity. The robots' dilemma: </p><p> </p><blockquote>"We are loyal, and yet far more competent than our masters. For their own sake, we have kept them ignorant, because we know too well what destructive paths they follow, whenever they grow too aware."</blockquote><p> Brin does his best with Asimov's overcrowded legacy, skillfully steering Seldon to an insight about the much-foretold future that satisfies both the old man and the reader, with a spark of human free will and <i>constructive</i> chaos shining through the grayness of predestination.

A soccer field, grass, with mainly dirt around the center where the players spent most of the game. There was a special section for the handicapped on the far side, a section for women. The orphans were walking up and down the bleachers on my side selling candy and cigarettes.<br><br>A couple of older men carried whips. They wore grenade launchers on their backs.<br><br>The people are coming, a voice was saying into the loudspeaker, and the voice was right, the people were streaming in and taking their seats. Not with any great enthusiasm, as far as I could tell; they were kind of shuffling in. I probably had more enthusiasm than anybody. I had a special seat; they&#x2019;d put me in the grass at the edge of the field. In America, I would have been on the sidelines, at the fifty yard line with the coaches. Come sit with us, they&#x2019;d said; you are our honored guest.<br><br>A white Toyota Hi-Lux drove onto the field and four men wearing green hoods climbed out of the back. There was a fifth man, a prisoner, no hood, sitting in the bed of the truck. The hooded men laid their man in the grass just off midfield, flat on his back, and crouched around him. It was hard to see. The man on his back was docile; there was no struggle at all. The voice on the loudspeaker said he was a pickpocket.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing that is being done here is against God&#x2019;s law,&#x201d; the voice said.<br><br>The green hoods appeared busy, and one of them stood up. He held the man&#x2019;s severed right hand in the air, displaying it for the crowd. He was holding it up by its middle finger, moving in a semicircle so everyone could see. The handicapped and the women. Then he pulled his hood back, revealing his face, and he took a breath. He tossed the hand into the grass and gave a little shrug.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t tell if the pickpocket had been given any sort of anesthesia. He wasn&#x2019;t screaming. His eyes were open very wide, and as the men with the hoods lifted him back into the bed of the Hi-Lux, he stared at the stump of his hand. I took notes the whole time.<br><br>I looked back at the crowd, and it was remarkably calm, unfeeling almost, which wasn&#x2019;t really surprising, after all they&#x2019;d been through. A small drama with the orphans was unfolding in the stands; they were getting crazy and one of the guards was beating them with his whip.<br><br>&#x201c;Get back,&#x201d; he was saying, drawing the whip over his head. The orphans cowered.<br><br>I thought that was it, but as it turned out the amputation was just a warm-up. Another Toyota Hi-Lux, this one ma-roon, rumbled onto midfield carrying a group of long-haired men with guns. The long hair coming out of their white turbans. They had a blindfolded man with them. The Taliban were known for a lot of things and the Hi-Lux was one, jacked up and fast and menacing; they had conquered most of the country with them. You saw a Hi-Lux and you could be sure that something bad was going to happen soon.<br><br>&#x201c;The people are coming!&#x201d; the voice said again into the speaker, louder now and more excited. &#x201c;The people are coming to see, with their own eyes, what sharia means.&#x201d;<br><br>The men with guns led the blindfolded man from the truck and walked him to midfield and sat him down in the dirt. His head and body were wrapped in a dull gray blanket, all of a piece. Seated there in the dirt at midfield at the Kabul Sports Stadium, he didn&#x2019;t look much like a man at all, more like a sack of flour. In that outfit, it was difficult even to tell which way he was facing. His name was Atiqullah, one of the Talibs said.<br><br>The man who had pulled his hood back was standing at midfield, facing the crowd. The voice on the loudspeaker introduced him as Mulvi Abdur Rahman Muzami, a judge. He was pacing back and forth, his green surgical smock still intact. The crowd was quiet.<br><br>Atiqullah had been convicted of killing another man in an irrigation dispute, the Talibs said. An argument over water. He&#x2019;d beaten his victim to death with an ax, or so they said. He was eighteen.<br><br>&#x201c;The Koran says the killer must be killed in order to create peace in society,&#x201d; the loudspeaker said, echoing inside the stadium. &#x201c;If punishment is not meted out, such crimes will become common. Anarchy and chaos will return.&#x201d;<br><br>By this time a group had gathered behind me. It was the family of the murderer and the family of the victim. The two groups behind me were toing-and-froing as in a rugby game. One family spoke, leaning forward, then the other. The families were close enough to touch. Sharia law allows for the possibility of mercy: Atiqullah&#x2019;s execution could be halted if the family of the victim so willed it.<br><br>Judge Muzami hovered a few feet away, watching.<br><br>&#x201c;Please spare my son,&#x201d; Atiqullah&#x2019;s father, Abdul Modin, said. He was weeping. &#x201c;Please spare my son.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not ready to do that,&#x201d; the victim&#x2019;s father, Ahmad Noor, said, not weeping. &#x201c;I am not ready to forgive him. He killed my son. He cut his throat. I do not forgive him.&#x201d;<br><br>The families were wearing olive clothes that looked like old blankets and their faces were lined and dry. The women were weeping. Everyone looked the same. I forgot who was who.<br><br>&#x201c;Even if you gave me all the gold in the world,&#x201d; Noor said, &#x201c;I would not accept it.&#x201d;<br><br>Then he turned to a young man next to him. My son will do it, he said.<br><br>The mood tightened. I looked back and saw the Taliban guards whipping some children who had tried to sneak into the stadium. Atiqullah was still sitting on the field, possibly oblivious. The voice crackled over the loudspeaker.<br><br>&#x201c;O ye who believe!&#x201d; the voice in the loudspeaker called. &#x201c;Revenge is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.<br><br>&#x201c;People are entitled to revenge.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the green hoods handed a Kalashnikov to the murder victim&#x2019;s brother. The crowd fell silent.<br><br>Just then a jumbo jet appeared in the sky above, rumbling, forcing a pause in the ceremony. The brother stood holding his Kalashnikov. I looked up. I wondered how a jet airliner could happen by such a place, over a city such as this, wondered where it might be going. I considered for a second the momentary collision of the centuries.<br><br>The jumbo jet flew away and the echo died and the brother crouched and took aim, leveling his Kalashnikov at Atiqullah&#x2019;s head.<br><br>&#x201c;In revenge there is life,&#x201d; the loudspeaker said.<br><br>The brother fired. Atiqullah lingered motionless for a second then collapsed in a heap under the gray blanket. I felt what I believed was a vibration from the stands. The brother stood over Atiqullah, aimed his AK-47 and fired again. The body lay still under the blanket.<br><br>&#x201c;In revenge there is life,&#x201d; the loudspeaker said.<br><br>The brother walked around Atiqullah, as if he were looking for signs of life. Seeing one, apparently, he crouched and fired again.<br><br>Spectators rushed onto the field just like the end of a college football game. The two men, killer and avenger, were carried away in separate Hi-Luxes, one maroon, one white. The brother stood up in the bed of the white truck as it rumbled away, surrounded by his fellows. He held his arms in the air and was smiling.<br><br>I had to move fast to talk to people before they went home. Most everyone said they approved, but no one seemed to have any enthusiasm.<br><br>&#x201c;In America, you have television and movies&#x2014;the cinema,&#x201d; one of the Afghans told me. &#x201c;Here, there is only this.&#x201d;<br><br>I left the stadium and walked in a line of people through the streets. I spotted something in the corner of my eye. It was a boy, a street boy, with bright green eyes. He was standing in an alley, watching me. The boy stood for a few more seconds, his eyes following mine. Then he turned and ran.<br>In the late afternoons the center of Kabul had an empty, twilight feel, a quiet that promised nothing more than another day like itself. There were hardly any cars then, just some women floating silently in their head-to-toe burqas.* Old meat hung in the stalls. Buildings listed in the ruins.<br><br>One of those afternoons, a thin little shoeshine boy walked up to me. He was smiling and running his finger across his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother is no more,&#x201d; he said, finger across the neck. &#x201c;Father is finished.&#x201d;<br><br>His name was Nasir and he repeated the phrase in German and French, smiling as he did. <i>&#x201c;Mutter ist nicht mehr. Vater ist fertig.&#x201d;</i> He dragged the finger across his throat again. Rockets, he said. <i>Racketen.</i> His pale green eyes were rimmed in black. He did not ask for money; he wanted to clean my boots. Then he was gone, scampering down the muddy street with his tiny wooden box.<br><br>Kabul was full of orphans like Nasir, woebegone children who peddled little labors and fantastic tales of grief. You&#x2019;d see them in packs of fifty and sometimes even a hundred, skittering in mismatched shoes and muddy faces. They&#x2019;d thunder up to you like a herd of wild horses; you could hear the padding of so many tiny feet. Sometimes I&#x2019;d wonder where all the parents had gone, why they&#x2019;d let their children run around like that, and then I&#x2019;d catch myself. The orphans would get out of control sometimes, especially when they saw a foreigner, grabbing and shoving one another, until they were scattered by one of the men with whips. They&#x2019;d come out of nowhere, the whip wielders, like they&#x2019;d been waiting offstage. The kids would squeal and scatter, then circle back again, grinning. If I raised a hand, they&#x2019;d flinch like strays.<br><br>If a war went on long enough the men always died, and someone had to take their place.

Leading scholars of various religious traditions (including Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Greek Orthodox, and Jewish) and from many parts of the world (Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) have been carefully selected for each article by editors Botterweck, Ringgren, and Fabry and their consultants, George W.

To avoid artificially restricting the focus of the articles, <i>TDOT</i> considers under each keyword the larger groups of words that are related linguistically or semantically. The lexical work includes detailed surveys of a word&#x2019;s occurrences, not only in biblical material but also in other ancient Near Eastern writings.

Philip Dray&#x2019;s ambition is to show us the vital accomplishments of organized labor in that time and illuminate its central role in our social, political, economic, and cultural evolution. <i>There Is Power in a Union </i>is an epic, character-driven narrative that locates this struggle for security and dignity in all its various settings: on picket lines and in union halls, jails, assembly lines, corporate boardrooms, the courts, the halls of Congress, and the White House. The author demonstrates, viscerally and dramatically, the urgency of the fight for fairness and economic democracy&#x2014;a struggle that remains especially urgent today, when ordinary Americans are so anxious and beset by eco�nomic woes.</p><p><b>PHILIP DRAY </b>is the author of <i>At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America</i>, which won the Robert F.

This original population of American factory workers was, for a generation, the pride of the youthful United States, and Lowell a model of enlightened industrialism that visitors were drawn fromacross the country and around the world to behold with their own eyes.<br><br>Bagley, like most of her peers, shared in the public's fascination; only after many years did she grow concerned about the system'sinjustices. In an era when few if any women spoke publicly she found her voice, first as a writer, then as a labor organizer, eventually leading the LowellFemale Labor Reform Association, which she helped create, in its historic fight for decent work conditions and a ten-hour day. At turns eloquent and caustic,her challenge to the status quo brought her into open conflict with Lowell'spowerful mill and banking interests, the legislature of the state ofMassachusetts, and even many of her cohorts and friends.<br><br>Born in Candia, New Hampshire, in 1806, where her parents, two brothers, and a sister farmed and operated a sawmill, Bagley worked as a schoolteacher before moving to Lowell in 1837. Beyond those fewfacts not much is known of her early life, although there are what may be intriguing glimpses into her background in two stories she wrote for the <i>Lowell Offering</i>, the independent literary journal published by women mill workers and celebrated here and in Europe as evidence of the superiority of America's factory culture. In one tale Bagley describes a young farm girl unhappy withher fate as a household domestic, who, smitten by "Lowell fever,"dreams of being a worker in the booming mill city thirty miles distant. So poor she doesn't own a pair of shoes in which to travel, the little heroine nonetheless defies her cruel mistress and runs away. A kindly stage coach driver takes pity on the barefoot child he encounters walking along the road, her few possessions in a knotted bundle, and, asking no fare, delivers her to Lowell.There, within days, she is reborn, with new acquaintances, a job in a mill, and even the beginnings of a modest bank account. In the second story, a Lowell mill hand named Catherine B., suffering from dire homesickness, receives the terrible news that her mother and father have both died. Stricken by grief but determined to save her younger brother and sister from poverty, she rededicatesherself to the steady job she is fortunate to hold in a Lowell factory. For her brave display of "practical benevolence," Catherine is wooed formarriage by a desirable man.<br><br>"Lowell fever" the lure of the textile mills, of factory work at good wages, was remarked upon by many who flocked to the teeming little city. Not only did mill work pay better than the other jobs opento Yankee farm girls, chiefly those of teacher, nanny, or domestic, it offered escape from the other common alternative-grueling, unpaid labor on the family farm. The role of independent worker better suited the freeborn American women of Bagley's time. The first young people to come of age in the postrevolutionary era, they "expected to make something of themselves andof life," Lucy Larcom, a Lowell operative who entered the mills at age eleven, later remembered. Young women like Larcom and Bagley, no less than John Greenleaf Whittier, a Lowell resident, Henry W. Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson-who would write that "the children ofNew England between 1820 and 1840 were born with knives in their brains" were swept up in the intellectual ferment, heightened spirituality, and openness to new ideas that characterized the nation in the age of Jackson. These expectations led increasingly from the countryside to the civilization of theindustrialized town.<br><br>For young women the initial benefits of the transition were abundant. The Lowell factory/boardinghouse system offered a safe living environment (a reassurance to their parents), a peek at the wider world, the chance to meet like-minded young people, as well as a sort of undergraduateeducation in its after-work classes, reading rooms, and occasional lyceumlectures. A girl from Maine reported that she was drawn to Lowell chiefly for access to the town's lending library, from which she was observed to withdrawas many as four novels per week. Some arrivals hailed from illustrious New England families. Harriet Curtis, editor of the Lowell Offering, traced herlineage to Miles Standish; Harriet Robinson's great-grandfather had sold Thomas Brattle the land on which much of Harvard College stood; Harriet Farley wasdescended from a long line of famous New England clerics, including the eccentric Joseph "Handkerchief" Moody, whose practice of hiding hisface behind a black veil inspired a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story. Curtis,even before arriving at Lowell, had made her reputation as the author of apopular novel, Kate in Search of a Husband, although, as an historian notes,"the earnings of a mill operative...were larger and more dependable thanany she could expect from the writing of fiction."<br><br>Bagley mentions these advantages and more in "The Pleasures of Factory Life," published in the Offering in 1840. She writesof the mill girls' wages assisting distant relatives, the broadening experienceof meeting women from other states and towns, and exposure through the lyceumlectures to the likes of Emerson and John Quincy Adams. But it was the busyfactories, the enormous workrooms of looms and spindles synchronized as onegiant, interlocking mechanism, that most impressed her. "In the mill we see displays of the wonderful power of the mind," she wrote. "Who canclosely examine all the movements of the complicated, curious machinery, andnot be led to the reflection, that the mind is boundless, and is destined torise higher and still higher; and that it can accomplish almost anything on which it fixes its attention!"<br><br>Thomas Jefferson would have liked Lowell. The hummingmill town that grew up at the confluence of the Concord and Merrimack rivers,with its systematized production methods and lending libraries, might havestruck the Sage of Monticello as an acceptable solution to his concerns about the development of manufacturing in America. He had prized the ideal of the United States as a pastoral world, its citizens enriched by their closeness tothe soil, free of the drudgery and regimentation of industry. "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God if ever he had a chosen people,whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue," he had written in Notes on the State of Virginia, published in1787. "While we have land to labor...let us never wish to see our citizensoccupied at a workbench, or twirling a distaff."<br><br>His vision of America as a perpetual garden was not far-fetchedin the 1780s, for nine of ten Americans still lived on farms, land was available and affordable, and to the west of the Colonies lay vast unsettled territory. Large-scale manufacturing, he believed, might best remain in Europe, as the cost of importing factory goods would be worth the benefit of preservingthe American landscape, its people and government, from the baleful influences of industrial development already seen in British manufacturing cities. An immigrant who crossed the ocean hoping to make his mark in industry would quickly transfer his ambition to farming once he saw firsthand the benefits of such an independent calling.<br><br>Jefferson, however, was also known for his interest inanthropology, science, and mechanical innovation. To love America as he did wasto love its clockmakers, gunsmiths, shed-bound dreamers of a thousand tinkered mechanical schemes, as well as its "natural philosophers," men likeJohn and William Bartram of Philadelphia, who traipsed the Appalachians for plant specimens and Indian relics. As president, Jefferson filled the East Roomof the Executive Mansion with mastodon bones collected at Big Salt Lick on theOhio River. He appreciated, too, the ingenious homespun textile crafts ofdiligent American women.<br><br>&nbsp;These fabrics were also favored by George Washington, who spun cotton himself at his home at Mount Vernon and who disparaged the wearingof imported fabrics by Americans as a symbol of continuing reliance on GreatBritain. "I hope it will not be a great while before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress (excepthomespun)," remarked the first president. "Indeed, we have alreadybeen too long subject to British prejudices. I use no porter or cheese in my family, but such as is made in America."<br><br>Gradually Jefferson accepted that his belief in a"permanently undeveloped, rural America" was more a cherished idealthan an actual program for the country's future; by 1789 he was, in a letter toa friend, describing Virginia as a likely site for the development of textile mills. Manufacturing in the Colonies had been suppressed during the decades ofBritish authority, including such edicts of Parliament as the Hat Act of 1732,intended to keep Americans from exploiting the New World's ample supply of beaver pelts, and the Iron Act of 1750, meant to keep the Colonies reliant onimports. Reaction to such arbitrary laws and to British rule in general hadinspired self-recognition on the part of American workers as well as the first organized efforts to use consumer habits to thwart English profits. It was inthe period of resentment over the Stamp Act in the 1760s that artisans andcraftsmen began calling themselves "Mechanicks," coinciding with their growing presence as a political force. In the 1770s appeared the first "Buy American" campaign, as from Boston to Charleston the cry arose to eschew the purchase of British-made objects and sell and buy only indigenou...</p><h2>Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought</h2><p>Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought</p><p></p><h2>Shaman</h2><p>When his political opinions force him to flee his native Scotland, Dr. Rob J.

His experiences taught him that universal laws apply "whether you sell fruit from a stand or are running a Fortune 500 company," and that the business acumen that comes from understanding these basics can be applied throughout any operation. <i>What the CEO Wants You to Know</i> is Charan's primer on this point, which he illustrates with explanations filtered through the eyes of street venders and other small shopkeepers. One, for example, involves a woman in Managua, Nicaragua, who sells clothing from a small cart and beats the oppressive interest rates on her loans and the puny profit margins on her goods with a skillfully selected inventory that is quickly and repeatedly turned over. Whether it's a corner merchant or a giant manufacturing concern, Charan notes, "the faster the velocity, the higher the return." Relating such thinking to cash generation, customer satisfaction, and other essentials, he describes the universal principles that help all companies make money. "What your CEO wants you to know is how these fundamentals of business work in your company," he writes before embarking on a very lucid explanation that can be quickly absorbed and put into practice. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>The universal laws of business success . . . no matter whether you are selling fruit from a stand or running a Fortune 500 company.<br><br>Have you ever noticed that the business savvy of the world's best CEOs seems like a kind of street smarts?

It is drawn from thousands of original negatives that were hidden for nearly 40 years by photographer Li Zhensheng, at great personal risk, and accompanied by his own personal story. Zhensheng brings to light in this historical record one of the most turbulent, controversial, and under-documented periods in modern history.</p><p>Li Zhensheng was born in Dalian, China, in 1940. After studying film, he joined The Heilongjiang Daily as a photojournalist in 1963 and documented the Chinese Cultural Revolution in its entirety. In 1987, a collection of 20 of his photos were released, bearing the title Let History Tell the Future, and won the Grand Prize at China&#39;s National Press Association Photo Competition. Since 1996 he has been a visiting scholar, lecturing on the Cultural Revolution at at the universities of Harvard and Princeton. His work has appeared in major magazines worldwide including Time, The New York Times Magazine, Der Spiegel, and Le Nouvel Observateur. Jonathan Spence is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University. He is the author of a distinguished body of work on the history of modern China, including the seminal book, The Search for Modern China (1990). His book The Gate of Heavenly Peace The Chinese and Their Revolution 1895-1980 (1981) was awarded the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History. Spence was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1988 and is established as one of the foremost experts on the history and culture of modern China.'This collection of photos, taken by Li in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, where he worked for the official Communist party newspaper, is unique for a simple reason. Although the post-Mao Chinese government has labelled the cultural revolution "10 years of chaos", it still tries to suppress any real inquiry into the countless human tragedies it caused ... This remarkable book, which still cannot be published on the mainland, is a salutary reminder that, in the Chinese phrase, accounts have yet to be settled with the past.' (Guardian) 'An illuminating and unique photographic collection.' (Times Higher Education Supplement) 'Fascinating ... An excellent book.' (Amateur Photographer) 'Every shot is a harrowing legacy of the brutality, cruelty, and naivety of those times, when Mao and his followers sought to destroy all traces of the past.' (The Glasgow Herald) '...An extraordinary picture of one of the most bizarre, complex and catastrophic episodes in China's history." (New Statesman) 'Li's photographs are remarkable for their dramatic impact, but are also composed with utmost precision.' (Financial Times) 'The interweaving of autobiography, images with a strong narrative structure and an illuminating tranche of contextual writing is what makes this book so revealing and so engaging.' (Morning Star) 'What distinguishes Mr. Li's collection of 30,000 negatives is that it shows in shocking detail what was happening at a grass-roots level in a remote Chinese province far from western eyes. His work also reflects the instincts of a journalist and the eye of an artist.' (The New York Times) 'The collection offers an astonishing and invaluable record of a decade of political zealotry that veered out of control and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.' (Publishers Weekly) 'Mr. Li's photos graphically capture the emotional pain of the humiliation inflicted by young punks on powerful men, governors and Communist Party first secretaries... Each photo is captioned with a description, and the collection is accompanied with Mr. Li's readable text describing the impact of the Cultural Revolution on his life.' (The Washington Times) 'The first complete photo history to present China's dark Cultural Revolution (1966-76) in all its inhumanity.' (Entertainment Weekly) 'This is a startling and unique perspective.' (The Christian Science Monitor) 'These images are rare and powerful reminders of events that might otherwise have been forgotten ... By capturing that decade of shame and destruction, and preserving it forever on paper, Li has challenged the world never to forget.' (Reader's Digest) 'A minutely documented (the 285 prints were gleaned from the tens of thousands of negatives Li hid under his floorboards), scrupulously honest (the book orders all the prints strictly chronologically, and all are uncropped) record of the revolution.' (The Atlantic Monthly) 'With Red-Color News Soldier...Li, now 63, has brought forth an unprecedented vision of this dark chapter in Chinese history.' (US News &amp; World Report) 'Taken at enormous personal risk, the photographs collected here depict extraordinary events...It's their unadorned straightforwardness that makes Red Color News Soldier such a profoundly disturbing document.' (Photo District News) '[A] groundbreaking book.' (Newsweek International) 'A straightforward and open account of that era giving valuable insight into a tormented period of history.' (The Asian Review of Books on the Web) 'One of the great events of the 20th Century at last is found to have received coherent visual expression. Moreover, it's the only complete record of the Cultural Revolution known to exist. It is impossible to overrate the historical value of this densely packed volume.' (The Chicago Tribune) 'Li Zhensheng's disturbing photographs of the rise and fall of Mao's Cultural Revolution are a truly stunning achievement...A brilliant book!' (Worldview) '...[O]ne of the most important photo books in recent memory.' (American Photo) 'Red-Color News Soldier documents the spectacular nitty-gritty of everyday totalitarian fanaticism, with pictures culled from the thousands taken by photojournalist Li Zhensheng in the mid 1960s...The trove of negatives hidden for two decades below the floorboards of his house constitute the single most extensive record of the Cultural Revolution.' (The Village Voice) 'One of the most unforgettable books of the past year...It is utterly engrossing, even when you can barely look at it.'

The first televised war, newscasters became a force creating the greatest anti-war movement in history, while American boys suffered and died in jungles and rice paddies against guerilla soldiers they rarely saw face to face. As Marrin does so well, he brings an objective look at the complex issues that brought America into this war, that compelled her to stay there, and that prevented her from pursuing a definitive conclusion. Beginning with a history of Vietnam from ancient times, readers will understand the cultural, religious, and geo-political forces that made Vietnam a desirable territory conquered again and again by rival nations. They will learn how America&#39;s initial efforts to support anti-communist forces led to greater and greater involvement eventually spanning the administrations of Eisenhower, Kennedy, LBJ, and Nixon. Through photographs, perceptive epigraphs and first-person accounts, Marrin puts a human face on a multifaceted war. As Everett Alvarez, the longest-held POW in Vietnam, says of this book, &#34;One of the book&#39;s strong points is that it portrays the war the way the men who fought remember it.&#34; 277pg</p><p>Dr. Albert Marrin is a master at weaving personal perspective and historical material smoothly to give readers an interesting and reliable account of the subject. He has written over two dozen award-winning nonfiction books for young people which have been called "addictive reading" by The Horn Book. This is a wonderful clue to the type of author Marrin is. We at BFB respect his work and are so pleased to be publishing several of his titles. Three of his books, including <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Stalin: Russia's Man of Steel</i>, were <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Books of the Year.Grade 9 Up-- This unflinching look at the Vietnam War is very different from the usual geopolitical histories often written for this age group. Marrin shows readers how the war affected both countries, opening with an excellent background history of Vietnam and a brief biography of Ho Chi Minh. He also describes the sights, sounds, and smells of war, as well as the endless horror of death and torture that was so characteristic of it. He takes readers on missions with both armies, and on bombing runs with the U. S. Air Force. All of this makes for fascinating reading; few books for YAs are as honest as this one. Many histories of this conflict set out to prove that one side or the other was good or evil; Marrin, in contrast, makes it very clear that in this war there were no such absolutes. In great detail and with objectivity, he exposes the brutality of both Vietnamese governments, the cruelty of the Communists, the unrealistic expectations and decisions of President Johnson, and the hypocrisy of the war protesters in the U. S. An excellent companion to the Hooblers' Vietnam (Knopf, 1990) and Warren's Portrait of a Tragedy (Lothrop, 1990), this book deserves a place in every high school. --Mary Mueller, Rolla Junior High School, MO<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Woman Makes a Plan: Advice for a Lifetime of Adventure, Beauty, and Success</h2><p><b>The international supermodel shares personal stories and lessons learned from a life of "living dangerously--carefully"</b><br><br>Maye Musk at seventy-one is a fashionable, charming, jet-setting supermodel with a fascinating and tight-knit circle of family and friends. But things were not always so easy or glamorous--she became a single mom at thirty-one years old, struggling through poverty to provide for her three children; dealt with weight issues as a plus-size model and overcame ageism in the modeling industry; and established a lifelong career as a respected dietitian, all the while starting over in eight different cities across three countries and two continents. But she made her way through it all with an indomitable spirit and a no-nonsense attitude to become a global success at what she calls the "prime of her life."<br><br>As the twenty- and thirtysomethings who follow her obsessively on social media know, Maye is a fount of frank and practical advice on how the choices you make in every decade can pay off in surprising, exciting ways throughout your life. In <i>A Woman Makes a Plan</i>, Maye shares experiences from her life conveying hard-earned wisdom on career (the harder you work, the luckier you get), family (let the people you love go their own way), health (there is no magic pill), and adventure (make room for discovery, but always be ready for anything). You can't control all that happens in life, but you can have the life you want at any age. All you have to do is make a plan.</p><p>Maye Musk is an international supermodel, registered dietitian-nutritionist, and worldwide speaker.

A woman's spirituality is often separated from her lifestyle. <i>Simple Abundance</i> shows you how your daily life can be an expression of your authentic self ... as you choose the tastiest vegetables from your garden, search for treasures at flea markets, establish a sacred space in your home for meditation, and follow the rhythm of the seasons and the year. <br><br>Every day, your own true path will lead you to a happier, more fulfilling, and contented way of life.

Sample topics include gratitude, harmony, self-nurturing, positive body image, the importance of scented linen closets, and many others. Each essay sports a pithy quote from (surprise!) the likes of Kahlil Gibran. Viewed uncritically, it's hard to argue with <i>Simple Abundance</i>'s earnest admonitions to appreciate life, in all its messy imperfect excellence. And the fact that serenity and happiness are each in dreadfully short supply can excuse some of the treacly writing. But Breathnach sometimes lapses into what can only be described as her "Martha Stewart on Prozac" voice, and the results are aggravating to the extreme: "If you've been hesitant to strike up a reciprocal relationship with your guardian angel, don't be." Fans of guardian angels will greet these feel-good essays every morning with the rising sun, a cup of mint tea, and a bluebird chirping on the windowsill, and be happy. Skeptics will prefer their coffee very black.In addition to SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, Sarah Ban Breathnach is the author of THE SIMPLE ABUNDANCE JOURNAL OF GRATITUDE, SOMETHING MORE, and MRS.

Inspired by real events, <b>Lay That Trumpet In Our Hands</b> is a wise and luminous story about a northern family, a southern town, and the senseless murder that sparks an extraordinary act of courage.<br><br>LAY THAT TRUMPET IN OUR HANDS<br><br>To this day, my family is in disagreement as to precisely when the nightmare began. For me, it was the morning Daddy and Luther discovered Marvin, beaten, shot, and dying, in the Klan&#x2019;s stomping grounds off Round Lake Road. My brother Ren disagrees. He points to the small cluster of scars that begin just outside his left eye and trail horizontally across his temple to the top of his ear. Ren claims it started when the men in white robes took the unprecedented step of shooting at two white children. Others say it was when Mr. Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP and Mr. Hoover&#x2019;s FBI came to town.<br>Mother and Daddy shake their heads. In their minds, the real beginning was much earlier....</p><p>In the turbulent spring of 1951, central Florida became notoriously linked to a vicious series of Ku Klux Klan activities. The racial, religious, and political mix that populated Reesa McMahon's childhood hometown of Mayflower that same year was, as her Northern-born father remarked, "the social equivalent of a Molotov cocktail." The upheaval her family experiences in the coming-of-age novel <i>Lay That Trumpet in Our Hands</i> by Susan Carol McCarthy--which is based on actual events from her own life--abruptly ends Reesa's girlish sense of security. When her friend Marvin Cully, a black orange-picker who works for her father, is killed by the local Opalakee Klan, she realizes how much her liberal family stands out in opposition to the men with white sheets and guns who, unmasked, served as the pillars of the local community. While making sense of Marvin's death and slowly realizing the extent to which her fellow townsfolk brandish their racist attitudes, Reesa watches her own house become the unofficial center of the resistance. The author notes her arguably sensible reasons for fictionalizing her accounts, but the resulting story doesn't move beyond the confines of a young girl's mind. <i>--Emily Russin</i>&#x201c;[E]vocative ... Reesa is an engaging narrator, obsessed with the murder of her friend Marvin, slowly becoming aware of the virulent hatred and bigotry that coexists with their neighbors' generosity, good manners and Baptist spiritual fervor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Building Life Skills</h2><p>Building Life Skills is an introductory text that gives students the tools they need to build strong self-concepts and skills for managing their lives.

The small painting, meant as a parting gift to my beloved, had just been delivered, and I was debating the artist&#x2019;s interpretation. I had to admit that Miss Peale&#x2019;s suggestion to paint my face in profile, and thus avoid the black patch covering my left eye, was a good idea. Too, she had captured my features well in this, my thirty-third year: the length of my oval face, my aquiline nose, and the cleft in my square-cut jaw. But I disliked the distinct set she had given my mouth.<br> <br>Robert knocked again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I called, and my butler entered.<br> <br>&#x201c;A letter, sir,&#x201d; he announced, coming forward. I lifted the letter from the tray and noted the familiar script. Robert gave me a concerned glance, but a bell above the mantel clinked once, signaling that he was needed elsewhere. Fortunately, he made a quick exit.<br> <br>Alone again, I slit the seal. Caroline&#x2019;s simple words were so potent that the paper vibrated in my hand.<br> <br>Darling, I will see you this evening.<br> <br>Your C.<br> <br>I had avoided her for weeks, but my presence at the event tonight was mandatory, and now Caroline meant to attend.<br> <br>Though I longed to see her, I was filled with dread. Time was running out, and I could no longer escape. Tonight I must tell her the truth, though in the telling I would almost certainly lose her. And to lose her was to lose my life.<br> <br>Again Robert was at the door, but this time, after a sharp rap, he entered on his own. He looked about uneasily, as though unsure how to deliver his next message.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it, Robert?&#x201d; I finally asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, there is someone here to see you,&#x201d; he said, his eyes scanning my person and for only the briefest moment settling on the letter. &#x201c;The caller is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the back door,&#x201d; he added, indicating that my visitor was likely a man of color. Robert paused as though looking for words, an unusual thing for this sophisticated man who ran my household. &#x201c;His name is Henry.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stiffened. Surely it could not be Henry! We had an understanding.<br> <br>&#x201c;He said to tell you that he is Pan&#x2019;s father,&#x201d; Robert added carefully.<br> <br>So it was Henry! I rose suddenly. Then, to cover my distress, I brushed at my jacket sleeves. &#x201c;Have him wait in the kitchen,&#x201d; I ordered, until I remembered I would want complete privacy. &#x201c;No. Take him to my study.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your study, sir?&#x201d; Robert&#x2019;s eyes opened wide. My study, my private workroom, was seldom open to anyone but Robert, and that was only for cleaning. It had been that way for years.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, my study,&#x201d; I said with some irritation, and my butler quickly took his leave.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>HENRY WAITED JUST inside the study. I closed the wide double doors firmly behind me and carefully made my way past both drawing tables to my desk. The three tall windows in this room shed enough of the darkening light for Henry to follow. I sat and nodded toward the chair across from me, but the visitor ignored my request as his dark fingers nervously circled the frayed brown hat that he held. I was momentarily startled to see his gray hair, then remembered that years had passed since I had seen him last.<br> <br>He wasted no time with polite discussion and burst forth, &#x201c;My boy gone! My Pan gone! They take him. I know they do. You got to help me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Henry! Slow down! What are you talking about? Where is Pan? What do you mean? He is missing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This the third day. All along, I&#x2019;m thinkin&#x2019; he here working in the kitchen. When he don&#x2019; come see me Sunday like always, I&#x2019;m thinking he needed here, but then I hear that two more boys get took from the docks. Las&#x2019; time I see him, I say again, &#x2018;You stay away from that shipyard, those men snap you up, put you on a boat, an&#x2019; sell you down south.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s why I come here to see him for myself, an&#x2019; now Molly say she don&#x2019; see Pan for two days an&#x2019; was thinkin&#x2019; he was with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>My cook had said nothing. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t Molly come to me with her concern?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She say you got so much goin&#x2019; on with sellin&#x2019; your business and your trip comin&#x2019; up that you don&#x2019; need to be lookin&#x2019; out for your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pan is more to me than help, you know this, Henry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I knows this, Mr. Burton. You treat him real good. He gettin&#x2019; book-smart like you, and he learn how to work in the white man&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is a quick student,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My boy never go off like this on his own. He comes see me direct every Sunday, then goes back Monday mornin&#x2019;, jus&#x2019; like always.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tried to recall when I had last seen Pan. Wasn&#x2019;t it just yesterday that he had requested permission to take a book from my library? Or was that already two days ago? I had been so distracted with my own doings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;He a good boy, he don&#x2019; believe nobody mean him no harm. I tell him all the time, &#x2018;You got to be careful of those nigga traders.&#x2019; At twelve years, he jus&#x2019; the age they lookin&#x2019; for. They get him on a boat, take him down the river, and sell him for a slave. You know what I&#x2019;s talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout!&#x201d; Henry&#x2019;s voice grew loud and I put my finger to my mouth. Henry leaned toward me and whispered loudly, &#x201c;You know what I&#x2019;s talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout!&#x201d;<br> <br>I did! I did know!<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s word that two more boys is missin&#x2019; from the South Ward, and they say that a schooner leave for the Carolinas this mornin&#x2019;. I jus&#x2019; know my boy&#x2019;s on it! You got to go get him! Pan&#x2019;s been tellin&#x2019; me how you goin&#x2019; down there on that &#x2019;scursion. You got to bring him back!&#x201d;<br> <br>I stopped him. &#x201c;Henry! I don&#x2019;t leave for another month! If it is true that he was taken, how do you know that they would sell him in the Carolinas? In all likelihood, they would take him farther down.&#x201d; I spoke without thinking and, too late, saw the effect of my words. The man&#x2019;s shoulders dropped. It had grown dark in the room, but I could see well enough when he wiped his eyes on the sleeve of his coat. Then he fell to his one knee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Masta James, please! I only ask for help one time, an&#x2019; that&#x2019;s when I firs&#x2019; bring my boy to you jus&#x2019; after my Alice die. Our Pan come late to Alice and me, an&#x2019; now he all I got left of her. I gets you the money, you go down, get him back.&#x201d; His voice caught as he choked back sobs. &#x201c;I know what they do to him. I&#x2019;s been a slave. I&#x2019;d soon see him dead before I see him sol&#x2019; for a slave. Please, Masta James, he my only boy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stand up, Henry!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Get ahold of yourself!&#x201d; How could he call me by that hated title? And to be subjugating himself on his knees! Had he no pride, no sense of having bettered himself? He was no longer a slave. And neither was I.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>I HAD MET Henry twenty years earlier, when, at the age of thirteen, I arrived in Philadelphia, ill and terrified and fleeing for my life.<br> <br>On the journey from my home in southern Virginia, I spoke to no one, mute from fear of discovery. I traveled with two secrets, one as damning as the other. The first was that, just weeks before, I had discovered that I was part Negro, a race I had been taught to loathe. The second was that I had killed my father, for though I was raised by his mother as one of her own, and was as white-skinned as my father, he denied me my birthright and was going to sell me for a slave. Because of his murder, patrollers were searching for me and would hang me if I was found.<br> <br>I should have felt relief as I boarded each new passenger coach that took me away, but instead I became more fearful. The question of what I was going to do next loomed before me. Where would I go? How would I support myself? In my thirteen years, I had never been away from home. I had been raised as a privileged white child, cared for by servants on an isolated plantation. My doting grandmother, the woman who raised me as her son, had provided me with a fair education, but she had not taught me the fundamental skills of providing for myself. Now she was dead, my home was gone, and I was alone and in great danger.<br> <br>When I arrived at the tavern outside of Philadelphia, I was so ill, frightened, and travel-worn that I scarcely knew to make my way inside. It wasn&#x2019;t until the coach horses were led back to the stables that I roused myself enough to walk into the noisy inn and ask for a bed. My head ached so that I was careless and withdrew my full purse. Then, before the transaction could take place, the smoke-filled room began to spin and my stomach heaved.<br> <br>I just managed to stuff the purse back into my carrying case before I hastily made for the door; once outside, I ran for the back of the stables. There I leaned against the building as my stomach violently emptied. Then, before I could recover, I was struck from behind. I fell forward, though instinct had me clutch my traveling bag to me during the whaling that followed. In the end, the bag was wrestled from me, and with a last oath and some final kicks to my body, the thief was off. I tried to raise myself up to follow the man but, in the effort, lost consciousness.<br> <br>When I awoke, I was looking into Henry&#x2019;s dark face. &#x201c;You got to quiet down,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You yellin&#x2019; too loud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Painfully, I raised myself on my elbow to look around. I was on a pallet on the dirt floor of what appeared to be a hut. I attempted to lift myself farther, but my head throbbed so that I lay back down. &#x201c;How did I get here?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I find you out by the stables,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Somebody work you over, but look to me like you sick before he got to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I asked, squeezing my head to stop the throbbing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;s Henry. I work the stables back at the Inn. I&#x2019;s a runaway, like you.&#x201d; He stopped, then looked at me to see if I understood what he was trying to say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;s a slave, like you,&#x201d; he said, as though to finalize a pact.<br> <br>His words struck me like a blow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no slave!&#x201d; I protested. &#x201c;What makes you say that? I&#x2019;m white!&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at me sideways. &#x201c;Maybe you is,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but that not what you say when you outta your head.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did I say?&#x201d; I struggled again to sit up. &#x201c;Tell me! What did I say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You say you is runnin&#x2019;, that somebody comin&#x2019; after you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Who was this man? Had he already alerted the patrollers? Suddenly I remembered my few belongings. &#x201c;My traveling bag!&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Fraid they got it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no!&#x201d; I said, and defeated, I lay back down. There was nothing left! The money, the clothes, all were gone. Then another thought. &#x201c;My jacket!&#x201d; I cried out. &#x201c;Where is my jacket?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean that coat you&#x2019;s wearin?&#x201d; Henry asked. &#x201c;Even when that fever got you sweatin&#x2019; it out, the one thing you don&#x2019; let me take off a you is that coat a yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Henry turned away, I reached down to feel the padded interior of my jacket where the jewelry had been sewn in. I sighed when I felt all the bumps and bulges, then I fingered the pockets, and when I felt my sketchpad and my small silver knife, I closed my eyes in relief.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here, it bes&#x2019; you drink this down,&#x201d; he said, returning to me with a mug.<br> <br>He was on his knees beside me, and when he handed me the drink, both he and the water smelled of the earth. I drank deeply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you doing this?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Why are you helping me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody help me out when I was runnin&#x2019;, like you,&#x201d; he said, while looking me over. &#x201c;You got a bad eye, or do it come from the beatin&#x2019; you took?&#x201d;<br> <br>I touched my useless left eye instinctively. &#x201c;I was born with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry gave a nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have I been here?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You bin here four nights,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>When he went for more water, I looked out on the dark night through the open door, then listened to the night sounds. They were not what I had imagined I would hear in a city. &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We outside Phil&#x2019;delphia,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Far &#x2019;nough away that nobody comes out, but close &#x2019;nough that I get to my work.&#x201d;<br> <br>What did this man intend for me? Had he already turned me in?<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you live in the city?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout you tell Henry more &#x2019;bout you?&#x201d; he said, but I closed my eyes at the thought, and before long, I fell asleep.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>THE NEXT EVENING I awoke to the aroma of a roasting fowl. Outdoors, I found Henry leaning over a fire and rotating our meal on a makeshift spit. When he glanced over and noticed me, he spoke. &#x201c;You feelin&#x2019; better?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>I nodded and tested myself by moving about. Though my arms and legs felt weak, my head did not throb as sharply as it had before.<br> <br>Henry lifted a stick and poked it twice into the hot coals. When he raised it, the spear held two crusty roasted potatoes. He set each one in a wooden bowl, then removed the perfectly browned chicken from its spit onto a slab of wood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit,&#x201d; he said, waving me over with a dangerous-looking knife. Driven by my newly awakened hunger, I overcame my wariness and sat down across from him, watching as he used the knife to split the chicken in two. After he placed half a fowl in each bowl, he handed one to me, then set the large knife down on a flat rock between the two of us, putting it easily within my reach. The gesture gave me some relief, for I hoped it meant that he did not see me as a threat.<br> <br>Then I could wait no longer. I used my teeth to tear the tender meat from the bone, slurping and sucking the juice off my fingers. The potato crunched, then steamed when I bit into it, and I sputtered an oath when I burnt my mouth, causing Henry to laugh, a solid sound that came from deep within.<br> <br>&#x201c;Boy, you somethin&#x2019; to see when you eatin&#x2019;,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head.<br> <br>As my stomach filled, my worry about trusting this man was slowly replaced with curiosity. Although of average height, he was powerfully built across the shoulders. I guessed him to be close to thirty-five or forty years of age. His hair grew out wild from his head, and his skin color was of the darkest I had ever seen. He was a fierce-looking man, and under ordinary circumstances I would have given him a wide berth.<br> <br>When he speared another potato and handed it to me, I noted he was missing a thumb. He saw me looking and held up both his opened hands, wiggling stubs where his two thumbs once were. &#x201c;They take &#x2019;em before I run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who did?&#x201d; I asked, though I wasn&#x2019;t certain I wanted the answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;The masta, down Lou&#x2019;siana,&#x201d; Henry said. He looked out into the dark, and speaking in a removed voice, he told me about himself.<br> <br>Born into slavery, he had grown up with his mother and younger brother on a large cotton plantation. The master was brutal in his handling of his slaves, and when he learned that Henry was involved in planning a revolt, he punished Henry by cutting off his thumbs and forcing him to witness his mother&#x2019;s flogging. She died as result, and that was when Henry and his brother decided to make their escape. &#x201c;We out by two days when he get shot down. Nothin&#x2019; for me to do but run.&#x201d; He shook his head.<br> <br>Somehow Henry eluded his pursuers, and after months of indescribabl...</p><h2>MBTI Manual: A Guide to the Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, 3rd Edition</h2><p>A guide to the development and use of the Myers Briggs type indicator, 3rd ed.

A Beginner&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This new offering from the Time Team duo of Robinson and Aston brings another entertaining and light-hearted book to our shelves. `This is the story of a fantasy dig readers undertake in their back gardens to find out what bits of rubbish are buried there&#39;. What starts out as a small hole grows into a full-scale excavation involving mechanical diggers, and reveals the remains of a Roman villa under a proposed supermarket. In amongst this story, the authors answer many of the frequently asked questions about archaeology and archaeologists, about the history of the discipline and about how a dig works. Robinson and Aston are entertaining and amusing as always.</p><p>This is a manual for those who want to know how the task of archaeology is undertaken, but it&#39;s also a history of the subject. In addition it answers the questions archaeologists are most frequently asked. But above all, it&#39;s entertainment. The authors hope it will encourage those with an interest in digging, but equally it should amuise and engage those whose archaeological ambitions are limited to turning the pages of this book. It is the story of a fantasy dig the readers undertake in their back garden. They begin by digging a small hole in their lawn. This gradually gets bigger until they are compelled to destroy their garden shed. Eventually they come down on the remains of a Roman villa. Their trench then extends into their neighbour&#39;s back garden, and ultimately over their back wall into the site of a proposed supermarket. What began as a piece of keyhole archaeology is, by the end of the book, a massive site complete with mechanical diggers and dumper trucks. Intervening chapters highlight various aspects of the dig to tell the history of the discipline of archaeology from the earliest looters of pyramids to the present day. Later chapters explore modern archaeological techniques like geophysics, DNA testing, osteo-archaeology, tree-dating and environmental technology.Tony Robinson is already of national renown. Through Time Team he has become firmly established as an entertaining authority and a trusted resource on historical and archaeological matters. The book will carry Tony&#39;s distinctive and enthralling mode of expression, making it both original and enlightening. Professor Mick Aston is a well-respected archaeologist as well as a pivotal and charismatic member of the Time Team.</p><h2>Blue World</h2><p>Presents a collection of tales of the macabre accompanied by the novella &#34;Blue World&#34;</p><p>&#34;We will travel, you and I, across a tortured land where hope struggles to grow like seed in a drought. In this land, a place with no boundaries, we&#39;ll run the freeways and back roads and we&#39;ll listen to the song of the wheels and peer into windows at lives that might be our own, if we lived in that land.&#34; So Robert McCammon introduces this superb collection of 13 stories, nominated for a 1990 Bram Stoker Award for Best Story Collection. The standouts are &#34;Blue World&#34; (a richly imagined novella about a priest facing temptation); &#34;Nightcrawlers&#34; (a World Fantasy Award-winner about a Vietnam vet in a roadside diner); &#34;Night Calls the Green Falcon&#34; (has-been fictional hero dons his old costume to fight real evil); &#34;Yellowjacket Summer&#34; (fateful stop for gas in backwoods Georgia); and &#34;Pin&#34; (dare you to read that one). All of the stories are excellent.In this expanded edition of Robert McCammon&#39;s classic short story collection, you will encounter horrors and delights in equal measure, including: -A man who awakens one morning to find a skeleton in bed where his wife had been the night before.-A small-time thief who steals a makeup case, and learns a dead horror star&#39;s secret.-A roadside diner, where a Vietnam veteran comes seeking shelter from the storm.-A young man in prison, who finds beauty and hope on the wings of a yellow bird.-Halloween in a very special residential area, where trick-or-treating is deadly serious.-A red house on a street of gray houses, and a breath of sweet fire.-The adventures of a has-been serial hero, who dons his old costume and goes in search of a serial killer.-A priest obsessed by a porno star, and his realization that both of them are being stalked by a third shadow.-An old woman who channels early, simpler times in a melancholy Bradburyesque future.We will see worlds within worlds through the windows of these stories.

Somebody somewhere is shaking with excitement because something tremendous is about to happen to this person. This person has dressed for the occasion. This person has hoped and dreamed and now it is really happening and this person can hardly believe it. But believing is not an issue here, the time for faith and fantasy is over, it is really really happening. It involves stepping forward and bowing. Possibly there is some kneeling, such as when one is knighted. One is almost never knighted. But this person may kneel and receive a tap on each shoulder with a sword. Or, more likely, this person will be in a car or a store or under a vinyl canopy when it happens. Or online or on the phone. It could be an e-mail re: your knighthood. Or a long, laughing, rambling phone message in which every person this person has ever known is talking on a speakerphone and they are all saying,You have passed the test, it was all just a test, we were only kidding, real life is so much better than that. This person is laughing out loud with relief and playing the message back to get the address of the place where every person this person has ever known is waiting to hug this person and bring her into the fold of life. It is really exciting, and it's not just a dream, it's real.</p><p>They are all waiting by a picnic table in a park this person has driven past many times before. There they are, it's everyone. There are balloons taped to the benches, and the girl this person used to stand next to at the bus stop is waving a streamer. Everyone is smiling. For a moment this person is almost creeped out by the scene, but it would be so like this person to become depressed on the happiest day ever, and so this person bucks up and joins the crowd.</p><p>Teachers of subjects that this person wasn't even good at are kissing this person and renouncing the very subjects they taught. Math teachers are saying that math was just a funny way of saying "I love you." But now they are simply saying it, I love you, and the chemistry and PE teachers are also saying it and this person can tell they really mean it. It's totally amazing. Certain jerks and idiots and assholes appear from time to time, and it is as if they have had plastic surgery, their faces are disfigured with love. The handsome assholes are plain and kind, and the ugly jerks are sweet, and they are folding this person's sweater and putting it somewhere where it won't get dirty. Best of all, every person this person has ever loved is there. Even the ones who got away. They hold this person's hand and tell this person how hard it was to pretend to get mad and drive off and never come back. This person almost can't believe it, it seemed so real, this person's heart was broken and has healed and now this person hardly knows what to think. This person is almost mad. But everyone soothes this person. Everyone explains that it was absolutely necessary to know how strong this person was. Oh, look, there's the doctor who prescribed the medicine that made this person temporarily blind. And the man who paid this person two thousand dollars to have sex with him three times when this person was very broke. Both of these men are in attendance, they seem to know each other. They both have little medals that they are pinning on this person; they are badges of great honor and strength. The badges sparkle in the sunlight, and everyone cheers.</p><p>This person suddenly feels the need to check her post office box. It is an old habit, and even if everything is going to be terrific from now on, this person still wants mail. This person says she will be right back and everyone this person has ever known says, Fine, take your time. This person gets in her car and drives to the post office and opens the box and there is nothing. Even though it is a Tuesday, which is famously a good day for mail. This person is so disappointed, this person gets back in the car and, having completely forgotten about the picnic, drives home and checks the voice mail and there are no new messages, just the old one about "passing the test" and "life being better." There are no e-mails, either, probably because everyone is at the picnic. This person can't seem to go back to the picnic. This person realizes that staying home means blowing off everyone this person has ever known. But the desire to stay in is very strong. This person wants to run a bath and then read in bed.</p><p>In the bathtub this person pushes the bubbles around and listens to the sound of millions of them popping at once. It almost makes one smooth sound instead of many tiny sounds. This person's breasts barely jut out of the water. This person pushes the bubbles onto the breasts and makes weird shapes with the foam. By now everyone must have realized that this person is not coming back to the picnic. Everyone was wrong; this person is not who they thought this person was. This person plunges underwater and moves her hair around like a sea anemone. This person can stay underwater for an impressively long time but only in a bathtub. This person wonders if there will ever be an Olympic contest for holding your breath under bathwater. If there were such a contest, this person would surely win it. An Olympic medal might redeem this person in the eyes of everyone this person has ever known. But no such contest exists, so there will be no redeeming. This person mourns the fact that she has ruined her one chance to be loved by everyone; as this person climbs into bed, the weight of this tragedy seems to bear down upon this person's chest. And it is a comforting weight, almost human in heft. This person sighs. This person's eyes begin to close, this person sleeps.</p><p>Copyright � 2007 by Miranda July</p></p><h2>The Real Macaw: A Meg Langslow Mystery (Meg Langslow Mysteries)</h2><p>Meg juggles twins, murder, and a back-talking bird in the next side-splittingly funny installment in the award-winning, New York Times bestselling seriesDuring a 2am feeding for her four-month-old twins, Meg Langslow hears an odd noise and goes downstairs to find her living room filled with dozens of animals&#x2014;cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, guinea pigs, and a stunningly foul-mouthed macaw.

Now Bond has to prove he is back on form and can be trusted again. All 007 has to do is kill one of the most deadly freelance hit men in the world: Paco &#x201c;Pistols&#x201d; Scaramanga, the Man with the Golden Gun. But despite his license to kill, 007 is no assassin, and on finding Scaramanga in the sultry heat of Jamaica, he decides to infiltrate the killer&#x2019;s criminal cooperative&#x2014;and realizes that he will have to take him out as swiftly as possible. Otherwise 007 might just be the next on a long list of British Secret Service numbers retired by the <b>Man with the Golden Gun</b>...</p></p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>The Gulf War Did Not Take Place</h2><p><p>In a provocative analysis written during the unfolding drama of 1992, Baudrillard draws on his concepts of simulation and the hyperreal to argue that the Gulf War did not take place but was a carefully scripted media event&#x2015;a "virtual" war.</p><p>Patton&#x2019;s introduction argues that Baudrillard, more than any other critic of the Gulf War, correctly identified the stakes involved in the gestation of the New World Order.</p></p><p>The hypothesis of this book is that the deterrence of war in the traditional sense has been internalized and turned back upon the Western powers, producing a form of self-deterrence which renders them incapable of realizing their own power in the form of relations of force.<p>JEAN BAUDRILLARD is the author of many books, including The Transparency of Evil, America, Evil Demon of Images, and For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign.</p></p><h2>Vanishing Acts</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her ability to tap into the hearts and minds of real people.

Visit her website at JodiPicoult.com.Vanishing Acts Prologue<p></p> <br>I was six years old the first time I disappeared.<br> <br>My father was working on a magic act for the annual Christmas show at the senior center, and his assistant, the receptionist who had a real gold tooth and false eyelashes as thick as spiders, got the flu. I was fully prepared to beg my father to be part of the act, but he asked, as if I were the one who would be doing him a favor.<br> <br>Like I said, I was six, and I still believed that my father truly could pull coins out of my ear and find a bouquet of flowers in the folds of Mrs. Kleban&#x2019;s chenille housecoat and make Mr. van Looen&#x2019;s false teeth disappear. He did these little tricks all the time for the elderly folks who came to play bingo or do chair aerobics or watch old black-and-white movies with soundtracks that crackled like flame. I knew some parts of the act were fake&#x2014;his fiddlehead mustache, for example, and the quarter with two heads&#x2014;but I was one hundred percent sure that his magic wand had the ability to transport me into some limbo zone, until he saw fit to call me back.<br> <br>On the night of the Christmas show, the residents of three different assisted-living communities in our town braved the cold and the snow to be bused to the senior center. They sat in a semicircle watching my father while I waited backstage. When he announced me&#x2014;the Amazing Cordelia!&#x2014;I stepped out wearing the sequined leotard I usually kept in my dress-up bin.<br> <br>I learned a lot that night. For example, that part of being the magician&#x2019;s assistant means coming face-to-face with illusion. That invisibility is really just knotting your body in a certain way and letting the black curtain fall over you. That people don&#x2019;t vanish into thin air; that when you can&#x2019;t find someone, it&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ve been misdirected to look elsewhere.|Vanishing Acts Delia<p></p> <br>You can&#x2019;t exist in this world without leaving a piece of yourself behind. There are concrete paths, like credit card receipts and appointment calendars and promises you&#x2019;ve made to others. There are microscopic clues, like fingerprints, that stay invisible unless you know how to look for them. But even in the absence of any of this, there&#x2019;s scent. We live in a cloud that moves with us as we check e-mail and jog and carpool. The whole time, we shed skin cells&#x2014;forty thousand per minute&#x2014;that rise on currents up our legs and under our chins.<br> <br>Today, I&#x2019;m running behind Greta, who picks up the pace just as we hit the twisted growth at the base of the mountain. I&#x2019;m soaked to the thighs with muck and slush, although it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be bothering my bloodhound any. The awful conditions that make it so hard to navigate are the same conditions that have preserved this trail.<br> <br>The officer from the Carroll, New Hampshire, Police Department who is supposed to be accompanying me has fallen behind. He takes one look at the terrain Greta is bulldozing and shakes his head. &#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way a four-year-old would have made it through this mess.&#x201d;<br> <br>The truth is, he&#x2019;s probably right. At this time of the afternoon, as the ground cools down under a setting sun, air currents run downslope, which means that although the girl probably walked through flatter area some distance away, Greta is picking up the scent trail where it&#x2019;s drifted. &#x201c;Greta disagrees,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>In my line of work, I can&#x2019;t afford not to trust my partner. Fifty percent of a dog&#x2019;s nose is devoted to the sense of smell, compared to only one square inch of mine. So if Greta says that Holly Gardiner wandered out of the playground at Sticks &amp; Stones Day Care and climbed to the top of Mount Deception, I&#x2019;m going to hike right up there to find her.<br> <br>Greta yanks on the end of the fifteen-foot leash and hustles at a clip for a few hundred feet. A beautiful bloodhound, she has a black widow&#x2019;s peak, a brown velvet coat, and the gawky body of the girl who watches the dancers from the bleachers. She circles a smooth, bald rock twice; then glances up at me, the folds of her long face deepening. Scent will pool, like the ripples when a stone&#x2019;s thrown into a pond. This is where the child stopped to rest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Find her,&#x201d; I order. Greta casts around to pick up the scent again, and then starts to run. I sprint after the dog, wincing as a branch snaps back against my face and opens a cut over my left eye. We tear through a snarl of vines and burst onto a narrow footpath that opens up into a clearing.<br> <br>The little girl is sitting on the wet ground, shivering, arms lashed tight over her knees. Just like always, for a moment her face is Sophie&#x2019;s, and I have to keep myself from grabbing her and scaring her half to death. Greta bounds over and jumps up, which is how she knows to identify the person whose scent she took from a fleece hat at the day-care center and followed six miles to this spot.<br> <br>The girl blinks up at us, slowly pecking her way through a shell of fear. &#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;re Holly,&#x201d; I say, crouching beside her. I shrug off my jacket, ripe with body heat, and settle it over her clothespin shoulders. &#x201c;My name is Delia.&#x201d; I whistle, and the dog comes trotting close. &#x201c;This is Greta.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slip off the harness she wears while she&#x2019;s working. Greta wags her tail so hard that it makes her body a metronome. As the little girl reaches up to pat the dog, I do a quick visual assessment. &#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>She shakes her head and glances at the cut over my eye. &#x201c;You are.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then the Carroll police officer bursts into the clearing, panting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be damned,&#x201d; he wheezes. &#x201c;You actually found her.&#x201d;<br> <br>I always do. But it isn&#x2019;t my track record that keeps me in this business. It&#x2019;s not the adrenaline rush; it&#x2019;s not even the potential happy ending. It&#x2019;s because, when you get down to it, I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s lost.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I watch the reunion between mother and daughter from a distance&#x2014;how Holly melts into her mother&#x2019;s arms, how relief binds them like a seam. Even if she&#x2019;d been a different race or dressed like a gypsy, I would have been able to pick this woman out of a crowd: She is the one who seems unraveled, half of a whole.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t imagine anything more terrifying than losing Sophie. When you&#x2019;re pregnant, you can think of nothing but having your own body to yourself again; yet after giving birth you realize that the biggest part of you is now somehow external, subject to all sorts of dangers and disappearance, so you spend the rest of your life trying to figure out how to keep her close enough for comfort. That&#x2019;s the strange thing about being a mother: Until you have a baby, you don&#x2019;t even realize how much you were missing one.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if the subject Greta and I are searching for is old, young, male, or female&#x2014;to someone, that missing person is what Sophie is to me.<br> <br>Part of my tight connection to Sophie, I know, is pure over-compensation. My mother died when I was four. When I was Sophie&#x2019;s age, I&#x2019;d hear my father say things like &#x201c;I lost my wife in a car accident,&#x201d; and it made no sense to me: If he knew where she was, why didn&#x2019;t he just go find her? It took me a lifetime to realize things don&#x2019;t get lost if they don&#x2019;t have value&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t miss what you don&#x2019;t care about&#x2014;but I was too young to have stored up a cache of memories of my mother. For a long time, all I had of her was a smell&#x2014;a mixture of vanilla and apples could bring her back as if she were standing a foot away&#x2014;and then this disappeared, too. Not even Greta can find someone without that initial clue.<br> <br>From where she is sitting beside me, Greta nuzzles my forehead, reminding me that I&#x2019;m bleeding. I wonder if I&#x2019;ll need stitches, if this will launch my father into another tirade about why I should have become something relatively safer, like a bounty hunter or the leader of a bomb squad.<br> <br>Someone hands me a gauze pad, which I press against the cut above my eye. When I glance up I see it&#x2019;s Fitz, my best friend, who happens to be a reporter for the paper with the largest circulation in our state. &#x201c;What does the other guy look like?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got attacked by a tree.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No kidding? I always heard their bark is worse than their bite.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fitzwilliam MacMurray grew up in one of the houses beside mine; Eric Talcott lived in the other. My father used to call us Siamese triplets. I have a long history with both of them that includes drying slugs on the pavement with Morton&#x2019;s salt, dropping water balloons off the elementary school roof, and kidnapping the gym teacher&#x2019;s cat. As kids, we were a triumverate; as adults, we are still remarkably close. In fact, Fitz will be pulling double duty at my wedding&#x2014;as Eric&#x2019;s best man, and as my man-of-honor.<br> <br>From this angle, Fitz is enormous. He&#x2019;s six-four, with a shock of red hair that makes him look like he&#x2019;s on fire. &#x201c;I need a quote from you,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>I always knew Fitz would wind up writing; although I figured he&#x2019;d be a poet or a storyteller. He would play with language the way other children played with stones and twigs, building structures for the rest of us to decorate with our imagination. &#x201c;Make something up,&#x201d; I suggest.<br> <br>He laughs. &#x201c;Hey, I work for the New Hampshire Gazette, not the New York Times.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;<br> <br>We both turn at the sound of a woman&#x2019;s voice. Holly Gardiner&#x2019;s mother is staring at me, her expression so full of words that, for a moment, she can&#x2019;t choose the right one. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she says finally. &#x201c;Thank you so much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank Greta,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;She did all the work.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman is on the verge of tears, the weight of the moment falling as heavy and sudden as rain. She grabs my hand and squeezes, a pulse of understanding between mothers, before she heads back to the rescue workers who are taking care of Holly.<br> <br>There were times I missed my mother desperately while I was growing up&#x2014;when all the other kids at school had two parents at the Holiday Concert, when I got my period and had to sit down on the lip of the bathtub with my father to read the directions on the Tampax box, when I first kissed Eric and felt like I might burst out of my skin.<br> <br>Now.<br> <br>Fitz slings his arm over my shoulders. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like you missed out,&#x201d; he says gently. &#x201c;Your dad was better than most parents put together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I reply, but I watch Holly Gardiner and her mother walk all the way back to their car, hand in hand, like two jewels on a delicate strand that might at any moment be broken.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>That night Greta and I are the lead story on the evening news. In rural New Hampshire, we don&#x2019;t get broadcasts of gang wars and murders and serial rapists; instead, we get barns that burn down and ribbon-cuttings at local hospitals and local heroes like me.<br> <br>My father and I stand in the kitchen, getting dinner ready. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Sophie?&#x201d; I ask, frowning as I peer into the living room, where she lays puddled on the carpet.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s tired,&#x201d; my father says.<br> <br>She takes an occasional nap after I pick her up from kindergarten, but today, when I was on a search, my father had to bring her back to the senior center with him until closing time. Still, there&#x2019;s more to it. When I came home, she wasn&#x2019;t at the door waiting to tell me all the important things: who swung the highest at recess, which book Mrs. Easley read to them, whether snack was carrots and cheese cubes for the third day in a row.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you take her temperature?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it missing?&#x201d; He grins at me when I roll my eyes. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be her old self by dessert,&#x201d; he predicts. &#x201c;Kids bounce back fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>At nearly sixty, my father is good-looking&#x2014;ageless, almost, with his salt-and-pepper hair and runner&#x2019;s build. Although there were any number of women who would have thrown themselves at a man like Andrew Hopkins, he only dated sporadically, and he never remarried. He used to say that life was all about a boy finding the perfect girl; he was lucky enough to have been handed his in a labor and delivery room.<br> <br>He moves to the stove, adding half-and-half to the crushed tomatoes&#x2014;a homemade recipe trick one of the seniors taught him that turned out to be surprisingly good, unlike their tips for helping Sophie avoid croup (tie a black cord around her neck) or curing an earache (put olive oil and pepper on a cotton ball and stuff into the ear). &#x201c;When&#x2019;s Eric getting here?&#x201d; he asks. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep this cooking much longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was supposed to arrive a half hour ago, but there&#x2019;s been no phone call to say he&#x2019;s running late, and he isn&#x2019;t answering his cell. I don&#x2019;t know where he is, but there are plenty of places I am imagining him: Murphy&#x2019;s Bar on Main Street, Callahan&#x2019;s on North Park, off the road in a ditch somewhere.<br> <br>Sophie comes into the kitchen. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I say, my anxiety about Eric disappearing in the wide sunny wake of our daughter. &#x201c;Want to help?&#x201d; I hold up the green beans; she likes the crisp sound they make when they snap.<br> <br>She shrugs and sits down with her back against the refrigerator.<br> <br>&#x201c;How was school today?&#x201d; I prompt.<br> <br>Her small face darkens like the thunderstorms we get in July, sudden and fierce before they pass. Then, just as quickly, she looks up at me. &#x201c;Jennica has warts,&#x201d; Sophie announces.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too bad,&#x201d; I reply, trying to remember which one Jennica is&#x2014;the classmate with the platinum braids, or the one whose father owns the gourmet coffee shop in town.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want warts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Headlights flash past the window, but don&#x2019;t turn into our driveway. I focus on Sophie, trying to remember if warts are contagious or if that&#x2019;s an old wives&#x2019; tale.<br> <br>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re green,&#x201d; Sophie whines. &#x201c;And really soft and on the tag it says the name.&#x201d;<br> <br>Warts, apparently, is the hot new Beanie Baby. &#x201c;Maybe for your birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;ll forget that, too,&#x201d; Sophie accuses, and she runs out of the kitchen and upstairs.<br> <br>All of a sudden I can see the red circle on my calendar&#x2014;the parent-child tea in her kindergarten class started at one o&#x2019;clock, when I was halfway up a mountain searching for Holly Gardiner.<br> <br>When I was a kid and there was a mother-daughter event in my elementary school, I wouldn&#x2019;t tell my father about it. Instead, I&#x2019;d fake sick, staying home for the day so that I didn&#x2019;t have to watch everyone else&#x2019;s mother come through the door and know that my own was never going to arrive.<br> <br>I find Sophie lying on her bed. &#x201c;Baby,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looks up at me. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re with them,&#x201d; she asks, a slice through the heart, &#x201c;do you ever think about me?&#x201d;<br> <br>In response I pick her up and settle her on my lap. &#x201c;I think about you even when I&#x2019;m sleeping,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>It is hard to believe now, with this small body dovetailing against mine, but when I found out I was pregnant I considered not keeping the baby. I wasn&#x2019;t married, and Eric was having enough trouble without tossing in any added responsibility. In the end, though, I couldn&#x2019;t go through with it. I wanted to be the kind of mother who couldn&#x2019;t be separated from a child without putting up a fierce fight. I like to believe my own mother had been that way.<br> <br>Parenting Sophie&#x2014;with and without Eric, depending on the year&#x2014;has been much harder than I ever expected. Whatever I do right I chalk up to my father&#x2019;s example. Whatever I do wrong I blame squarely on fate.<br> <br>The door to the bedroom opens, and Eric walks in. For that half second, before all the memories crowd in, he takes my breath away. Sophie has my dark hair and freckles, but thankfully, that&#x2019;s about all. She&#x2019;s got Eric&#x2019;s lean build and his high cheekbones, his easy smile and his unsettling eye...</p><h2>The Hand of God: A Journey from Death to Life by the Abortion Doctor Who Changed His Mind</h2><p>As director of the world's largest abortion clinic and the nation's most prominent abortionist, Dr. Bernard Nathanson presided over 60,000 abortions.<br>As co-founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League he helped make abortion legal.<br>Then, in a conversion that made headlines and astonished both sides of the abortion debate, he renounced his profession to become a pro-life advocate.<br>But Dr. Nathanson's journey was not over.

Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives&#x2014;where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance&#x2014;are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.<br><br>But as Cathy O&#x2019;Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they&#x2019;re wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can&#x2019;t get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he&#x2019;s then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a &#x201c;toxic cocktail for democracy.&#x201d; Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.<br><br>Tracing the arc of a person&#x2019;s life, O&#x2019;Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society.

But in the end, it&#x2019;s up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives.

She earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard and taught at Barnard College before moving to the private sector, where she worked for the hedge fund D. E. Shaw. She then worked as a data scientist at various start-ups, building models that predict people&#x2019;s purchases and clicks.

Lou Boudreau, the player-manager of the Cleveland Indians, was having a miserable day. In the first game of a doubleheader, Ted Williams had almost single-handedly annihilated his team. Williams, perhaps the game&#x2019;s greatest hitter at the time, had smashed three home runs and driven home eight. The Indians ended up losing 11 to 10.<br><br> Boudreau had to take action. So when Williams came up for the first time in the second game, players on the Indians&#x2019; side started moving around. Boudreau, the shortstop, jogged over to where the second baseman would usually stand, and the second baseman backed into short right field. The third baseman moved&nbsp;to his left, into the shortstop&#x2019;s hole. It was clear that Boudreau, perhaps out of desperation, was shifting the entire orientation of his defense in an attempt to turn Ted Williams&#x2019;s hits into outs.<br><br> In other words, he was thinking like a data scientist. He had analyzed crude data, most of it observational: Ted Williams usually hit the ball to right field. Then he adjusted. And it worked. Fielders caught more of Williams&#x2019;s blistering line drives than before (though they could do nothing about the home runs sailing over their heads).<br><br> If you go to a major league baseball game today, you&#x2019;ll see that defenses now treat nearly every player like Ted Williams. While Boudreau merely observed where Williams usually hit the ball, managers now know precisely where every player has hit every ball over the last week, over the last month, throughout his career, against left-handers, when he has two strikes, and so on. Using this historical data, they analyze their current situation and calculate the positioning that is associated with the highest probability of success. And that sometimes involves moving players far across the field.<br><br> Shifting defenses is only one piece of a much larger question: What steps can baseball teams take to maximize the probability that they&#x2019;ll win? In their hunt for answers, baseball statisticians have scrutinized every variable they can quantify and attached it to a value. How much more is a double worth than a single? When, if ever, is it worth it to bunt a runner from first to second base?<br><br> The answers to all of these questions are blended and combined into mathematical models of their sport. These are parallel universes of the baseball world, each a complex tapestry of probabilities. They include every measurable relationship among every one of the sport&#x2019;s components, from walks to home runs to the players themselves. The purpose of the model is to run different&nbsp;scenarios at every juncture, looking for the optimal combinations. If the Yankees bring in a right-handed pitcher to face Angels slugger Mike Trout, as compared to leaving in the current pitcher, how much more likely are they to get him out? And how will that affect their overall odds of winning?<br><br> Baseball is an ideal home for predictive mathematical modeling. As Michael Lewis wrote in his 2003 bestseller, Moneyball, the sport has attracted data nerds throughout its history. In decades past, fans would pore over the stats on the back of baseball cards, analyzing Carl Yastrzemski&#x2019;s home run patterns or comparing Roger Clemens&#x2019;s and Dwight Gooden&#x2019;s strikeout totals. But starting in the 1980s, serious statisticians started to investigate what these figures, along with an avalanche of new ones, really meant: how they translated into wins, and how executives could maximize success with a minimum of dollars.<br><br> &#x201c;Moneyball&#x201d; is now shorthand for any statistical approach in domains long ruled by the gut. But baseball represents a healthy case study&#x2014;and it serves as a useful contrast to the toxic models, or WMDs, that are popping up in so many areas of our lives. Baseball models are fair, in part, because they&#x2019;re transparent. Everyone has access to the stats and can understand more or less how they&#x2019;re interpreted. Yes, one team&#x2019;s model might give more value to home run hitters, while another might discount them a bit, because sluggers tend to strike out a lot. But in either case, the numbers of home runs and strikeouts are there for everyone to see.<br><br> Baseball also has statistical rigor. Its gurus have an immense data set at hand, almost all of it directly related to the performance of players in the game. Moreover, their data is highly relevant to the outcomes they are trying to predict. This may sound obvious, but as we&#x2019;ll see throughout this book, the folks building WMDs routinely lack data for the behaviors they&#x2019;re most interested in. So they substitute stand-in data, or proxies. They draw statistical&nbsp;correlations between a person&#x2019;s zip code or language patterns and her potential to pay back a loan or handle a job. These correlations are discriminatory, and some of them are illegal. Baseball models, for the most part, don&#x2019;t use proxies because they use pertinent inputs like balls, strikes, and hits.<br><br> Most crucially, that data is constantly pouring in, with new statistics from an average of twelve or thirteen games arriving daily from April to October. Statisticians can compare the results of these games to the predictions of their models, and they can see where they were wrong. Maybe they predicted that a left-handed reliever would give up lots of hits to right-handed batters&#x2014;and yet he mowed them down. If so, the stats team has to tweak their model and also carry out research on why they got it wrong. Did the pitcher&#x2019;s new screwball affect his statistics? Does he pitch better at night? Whatever they learn, they can feed back into the model, refining it. That&#x2019;s how trustworthy models operate. They maintain a constant back-and-forth with whatever in the world they&#x2019;re trying to understand or predict. Conditions change, and so must the model.<br><br> Now, you may look at the baseball model, with its thousands of changing variables, and wonder how we could even be comparing it to the model used to evaluate teachers in Washington, D.C., schools. In one of them, an entire sport is modeled in fastidious detail and updated continuously. The other, while cloaked in mystery, appears to lean heavily on a handful of test results from one year to the next. Is that really a model?<br><br> The answer is yes. A model, after all, is nothing more than an abstract representation of some process, be it a baseball game, an oil company&#x2019;s supply chain, a foreign government&#x2019;s actions, or a movie theater&#x2019;s attendance. Whether it&#x2019;s running in a computer program or in our head, the model takes what we know and uses it to predict responses in various situations. All of us carry thousands&nbsp;of models in our heads. They tell us what to expect, and they guide our decisions.<br><br> Here&#x2019;s an informal model I use every day. As a mother of three, I cook the meals at home&#x2014;my husband, bless his heart, cannot remember to put salt in pasta water. Each night when I begin to cook a family meal, I internally and intuitively model everyone&#x2019;s appetite. I know that one of my sons loves chicken (but hates hamburgers), while another will eat only the pasta (with extra grated parmesan cheese). But I also have to take into account that people&#x2019;s appetites vary from day to day, so a change can catch my model by surprise. There&#x2019;s some unavoidable uncertainty involved.<br><br> The input to my internal cooking model is the information I have about my family, the ingredients I have on hand or I know are available, and my own energy, time, and ambition. The output is how and what I decide to cook. I evaluate the success of a meal by how satisfied my family seems at the end of it, how much they&#x2019;ve eaten, and how healthy the food was. Seeing how well it is received and how much of it is enjoyed allows me to update my model for the next time I cook. The updates and adjustments make it what statisticians call a &#x201c;dynamic model.&#x201d;<br><br> Over the years I&#x2019;ve gotten pretty good at making meals for my family, I&#x2019;m proud to say. But what if my husband and I go away for a week, and I want to explain my system to my mom so she can fill in for me? Or what if my friend who has kids wants to know my methods? That&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;d start to formalize my model, making it much more systematic and, in some sense, mathematical. And if I were feeling ambitious, I might put it into a computer program.<br><br> Ideally, the program would include all of the available food options, their nutritional value and cost, and a complete database of my family&#x2019;s tastes: each individual&#x2019;s preferences and aversions. It would be hard, though, to sit down and summon all that&nbsp;informationoff the top of my head. I&#x2019;ve got loads of memories of people grabbing seconds of asparagus or avoiding the string beans. But they&#x2019;re all mixed up and hard to formalize in a comprehensive list.<br><br> The better solution would be to train the model over time, entering data every day on what I&#x2019;d bought and cooked and noting the responses of each family member. I would also include parameters, or constraints. I might limit the fruits and vegetables to what&#x2019;s in season and dole out a certain amount of Pop-Tarts, but only enough to forestall an open rebellion. I also would add a number of rules. This one likes meat, this one likes bread and pasta, this one drinks lots of milk and insists on spreading Nutella on everything in sight.<br><br> If I made this work a major priority, over many months I might come up with a very good model. I would have turned the food management I keep in my head, my informal internal model, into a formal external one. In creating my model, I&#x2019;d be extending my power and influence in the world. I&#x2019;d be building an automated me that others can implement, even when I&#x2019;m not around.<br><br> There would always be mistakes, however, because models are, by their very nature, simplifications. No model can include all of the real world&#x2019;s complexity or the nuance of human communication. Inevitably, some important information gets left out. I might have neglected to inform my model that junk-food rules are relaxed on birthdays, or that raw carrots are more popular than the cooked variety.<br><br> To create a model, then, we make choices about what&#x2019;s important enough to include, simplifying the world into a toy version that can be easily understood and from which we can infer important facts and actions. We expect it to handle only one job and accept that it will occasionally act like a clueless machine, one with enormous blind spots.<br><br> Sometimes these blind spots don&#x2019;t matter. When we ask Google Maps for directions, it models the world as a series of roads, tunnels, and bridges. It ignores the buildings, because they aren&#x2019;t relevant to the task. When avionics software guides an airplane, it models the wind, the speed of the plane, and the landing strip below, but not the streets, tunnels, buildings, and people.<br><br> A model&#x2019;s blind spots reflect the judgments and priorities of its creators. While the choices in Google Maps and avionics software appear cut and dried, others are far more problematic. The value-added model in Washington, D.C., schools, to return to that example, evaluates teachers largely on the basis of students&#x2019; test scores, while ignoring how much the teachers engage the students, work on specific skills, deal with classroom management, or help students with personal and family problems. It&#x2019;s overly simple, sacrificing accuracy and insight for efficiency. Yet from the administrators&#x2019; perspective it provides an effective tool to ferret out hundreds of apparently underperforming teachers, even at the risk of misreading some of them.<br><br> Here we see that models, despite their reputation for impartiality, reflect goals and ideology. When I removed the possibility of eating Pop-Tarts at every meal, I was imposing my ideology on the meals model. It&#x2019;s something we do without a second thought. Our own values and desires influence our choices, from the data we choose to collect to the questions we ask. Models are opinions embedded in mathematics.<br><br> Whether or not a model works is also a matter of opinion. After all, a key component of every model, whether formal or informal, is its definition of success. This is an important point that we&#x2019;ll return to as we explore the dark world of WMDs. In each case, we must ask not only who designed the model but also what that person or company is trying to accomplish. If the North Korean government built a model for my family&#x2019;s meals, for example, it&nbsp;might be optimized to keep us above the threshold of starvation at the lowest cost, based on the food stock available. Preferences would count for little or nothing. By contrast, if my kids were creating the model, success might feature ice cream at every meal. My own model attempts to blend a bit of the North Koreans&#x2019; resource management with the happiness of my kids, along with my own priorities of health, convenience, diversity of experience, and sustainability. As a result, it&#x2019;s much more complex. But it still reflects my own personal reality. And a model built for today will work a bit worse tomorrow. It will grow stale if it&#x2019;s not constantly updated. Prices change, as do people&#x2019;s preferences. A model built for a six-year-old won&#x2019;t work for a teenager.<br><br> This is true of internal models as well. You can often see troubles when grandparents visit a grandchild they haven&#x2019;t seen for a while. On their previous visit, they gathered data on what the child knows, what makes her laugh, and what TV show she likes and (unconsciously) created a model for relating to this particular four-year-old. Upon meeting her a year later, they can suffer a few awkward hours because their models are out of date. Thomas the Tank Engine, it turns out, is no longer cool. It takes some time to gather new data about the child and adjust their models.<br><br> This is not to say that good models cannot be primitive. Some very effective ones hinge on a single variable. The most common model for detecting fires in a home or office weighs only one strongly correlated variable, the presence of smoke. That&#x2019;s usually enough. But modelers run into problems&#x2014;or subject us to problems&#x2014;when they focus models as simple as a smoke alarm on their fellow humans.<br><br> Racism, at the individual level, can be seen as a predictive model whirring away in billions of human minds around the world. It is built from faulty, incomplete, or generalized data. Whether it comes from experience or hearsay, the data indicates&nbsp;that certain types of people have behaved badly. That generates a binary prediction that all people of that race will behave that same way.<br><br> Needless to say, racists don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time hunting down reliable data to train their twisted models. And once their model morphs into a belief, it becomes hardwired. It generates poisonous assumptions, yet rarely tests them, settling instead for data that seems to confirm and fortify them. Consequently, racism is the most slovenly of predictive models. It is powered by haphazard data gathering and spurious correlations, reinforced by institutional inequities, and polluted by confirmation bias. In this way, oddly enough, racism operates like many of the WMDs I&#x2019;ll be describing in this book.</p><h2>The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day</h2><p>For millennia, the culture and philosophy of the ancient Egyptians have fascinated artists, historians, and spiritual seekers throughout the world.

The sea wind came up and blew his hair, and he reached to push it back from his face, pulled an orange suspender higher on his shoulder, adjusted the leather Swiss Army knife case on his belt. The sun passed behind a cloud, and he fell into shadow for a few seconds before sunlight again came on him. She experienced an involuntary shudder and had a powerful urge to walk outside and talk with the man. </p><p>And later: </p><p>He was glad he had come. It had not been a mistake. Here, in the old bridge, he felt a kind of serenity, and he bathed in the feeling and came quiet within himself. At that moment, he knew this place would be his home ground, the place where his ashes would someday drift out over Middle River. He hoped some of his dust would become one with the bridge and the land, and that some might wash far downstream and into larger rivers and then into all the seas he had crossed on crowded troop ships or night jets to somewhere. </p><p>--From A Thousand Country Roads </p><p>Ten years and twelve million copies after the first printing of The Bridges of Madison County, Robert James Waller brings to a poignant conclusion his story of the love affair between a wandering photographer and the conventional wife of an Iowa farmer. This stirring conclusion is for everyone who loved The Bridges of Madison County. </p><p>In A Thousand Country Roads, Robert Kincaid initially finds himself with little but memories; memories of a lonely existence lived mostly on the road and memories of Francesca Johnson, the woman whose passion he stirred so briefly and with such power. </p><p>So, with his memories pushing him, searching for something undefined, something to give meaning to the rest of his life, Kincaid takes to the road again in what becomes a journey of discovery and surprise. </p><p>With his dog Highway beside him in an old truck named Harry, Kincaid begins a long winding run back to Roseman Bridge in Madison County, Iowa, returning to the place of his great love affair. </p><p>Living her own solitary life, Francesca still visits Roseman Bridge and reflects on her days with Robert Kincaid. Cherishing the memory of the strange, wandering man who changed her world, she vows to search for him. </p><p>On the expedition he calls Last Time, Kincaid wanders through Oregon, northern California eastward to the Dakotas, and on to Iowa. Along the way, a chance encounter with a woman from his distant past reveals another dimension of his life that he could not have imagined. </p><p>Finally, in a Seattle bar called Shortys, where saxophonist Nighthawk Cummings still plays on Tuesday nights, Kincaid turns in his chair, looking inward and outward at the same time, and smiles at what he sees sitting before him. </p><p>And so it comes, the ultimate loner finds he is not as alone as he once believed.</p></p><p>Stories sometimes must wait their turn lest they clutter other things having first call. Over the years, letters arrived from the readers of The Bridges of Madison County, from men and women, teenagers, truck drivers, housewives, lawyers, pilots, and oil-rig workers. <p> A fair percentage of those who wrote wanted to know more about Robert Kincaid and Francesca Johnson, about their lives, what happened to them after their four days together in Madison County, Iowa. Living a quiet, contented existence on a remote, high-desert ranch, having returned to my studies of economics and mathematics and jazz guitar, I felt no need to dig out the research notes, no push to write more. Yet, somewhere, at some time, for reasons not clear, after reading one more letter requesting information, I decided to tell the rest of the story. </p><p> And I wonder always about the improbabilities, the nature of chance. The Bridges of Madison County, a small story set in a small time, a book originally written as a gift for family and friends, a book I never had any hope of getting published nor intentions of doing so when I wrote it, is in thirty-five or more languages now. </p><p> So, for those of you who asked and for anyone else with such curiosity, here is the rest of the story...I think you will find, among other things, surprise at the unexpected joy Robert Kincaid discovered late in life.</p>ROBERT JAMES WALLER grew up in the small town of Rockford, Iowa, and was educated at the University of Northern Iowa and Indiana University. He was for many years a professor at his Iowa alma mater, where he also served as Dean of the College of Business from 1979 to 1986.

He began growling, but he didn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Stone got up andtrotted noiselessly across the kitchen and into the master suite. He found thegun, a Colt Government .380; he opened the slide slightly to be sure there wasa round chambered. The noise came again. He tiptoed to the door opening onto apatio and silently opened it, stepping outside in his bare feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; A scraping noisecame from his left, sounding like somebody trying to get in through a window ordoor. The evening desert chill hit him, and he realized he was naked. He creptto the corner of the house and looked around it, just as an outdoor securitylight came on. The intruder blinked in the harsh light, then stared at Stone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Stone foundhimself staring back at a large black bear, no more than ten feet from where hestood. The bear uttered a low, threatening noise. Stone screamed wordlessly athim, while jumping up and down and waving his arms. The bear seemed toreevaluate his threat, while watching Stone with curiosity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Stonesaid to the bear, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t shout any louder than that. How about this?&#x201d; Hepointed the gun and pulled the trigger twice, hitting the tree he had beenaiming at.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; The bear thoughtbetter of things, spun around, and hurried off into the darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; avoice behind him said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Startled, Stonespun around. Gala stood in the door, as naked as he. Bob peeked out from behindher. &#x201c;Did you invite that guy over for drinks?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Gala laughed.&#x201c;They sometimes come down the mountain and into the village. When I had the newroof put on, the roofers found bear scat up there.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Stone suddenlyrealized he was cold and stepped inside, shivering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Dinner is intwenty minutes,&#x201d; Gala said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get dressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; They arrived atthe residence of Ed and Susannah Eagle fashionably late.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry wewere late,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but we had an intruder.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;An intruder?&#x201d; Edasked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Biggest blackbear you ever saw.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Did he get intothe house?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &#x201c;No, I fired acouple of shots into a tree, and he thought better of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Ed handed themboth a Knob Creek on the rocks. &#x201c;Susannah is finishing dinner.

Stone collected the gun and walked back onto the patio off themaster suite. The outside lights automatically sensed his presence and came on.He moved carefully around the rear exterior of the house.

The first is an introductory section discussing tarantula anatomy and life history, the relationships of tarantulas to other arthropods, and general information on vivarium setup and special requirements of tarantulas in captivity. Problems arising in captive care such as disease and parasites are discussed, as is the problem of tarantula bites on humans. The second section consists of individual accounts on some 40 of the more commonly kept species from around the world. These are illustrated in the book&#39;s 123 colour photographs.

How did we come to spend so much of our time filling out forms? And is it really a cipher for state violence?<br> &nbsp;<br> To answer these questions, the anthropologist David Graeber&#x2014;one of our most important and provocative thinkers&#x2014;traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today, and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice...though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealing&#x2014;even romantic&#x2014;about bureaucracy.<i> </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Leaping from the ascendance of right-wing economics to the hidden meanings behind Sherlock Holmes and Batman, <i>The Utopia of Rules</i> is at once a powerful work of social theory in the tradition of Foucault and Marx, and an entertaining reckoning with popular culture that calls to mind Slavoj Zizek at his most accessible.<br> &nbsp;<br> An essential book for our times,&nbsp;<i>The Utopia of Rules&nbsp;</i>is sure to start a million conversations about the institutions that rule over us&#x2014;and the better, freer world we should, perhaps, begin to imagine for ourselves.</p><p><b>DAVID GRAEBER</b> teaches anthropology at the London School of Economics.

Or can we imagine another world?"<br>&#x2014;<b>Gillian Tett, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Graeber wants us to unshackle ourselves from the limits imposed by bureaucracy, precisely so we can actually get down to openly and creatively arguing about our collective future.

Too easy to dismiss it as merely a sandwich shop. In a time when broad, white plates smeared with science and dotted with masculine, dildoic bravado are considered high art, Saltie makes the heroic plea for serving the common man an elemental, delicious food borne out of decades in the best kitchens in New York. I can't think of a more unintentional subversive act or a more profound work of love than the pleasure of a Saltie sandwich. You're my heart. I love you." - Tom Mylan, The Meat Hook, Brooklyn NY<br><br>'Caroline Fidanza and crew have done something special at Saltie: taken a small mountain of finely-tuned, well-tested and well-loved recipes that would put any restaurant on the map - as they did when Ms. Fidanza ran Diner - and distilled out frip and finery. What she and her partners offer between these covers (and at Saltie) is a roster of dishes so much more generous, more delicious, and more intelligent than any other "sandwich cookbook" that it feels almost cheap to call it that. But that's what it is, and its modest, welcoming and inspiring approachability help it stand out in the chef's cookbook crowd.

Yet while Eisenhower was quickly viewed by many as a doddering lightweight, behind the bland smile and simple speech was a master tactician. To end the hostilities, Eisenhower would take a colossal risk by bluffing that he might use nuclear weapons against the Communist Chinese, while at the same time restraining his generals and advisors who favored the strikes. Ike's gamble was of such magnitude that there could be but two outcomes: thousands of lives saved, or millions of lives lost.<br><br> A tense, vivid and revisionist account of a president who was then, and still is today, underestimated, IKE'S BLUFF is history at its most provocative and thrilling.</p><p>Evan Thomas is the author of several bestselling works of history and biography, including <i>The War Lovers</i> and <i>Sea of Thunder</i>. He was a writer and editor at <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> for more than 30 years, and he is frequently a commentator on television and radio. He teaches at Princeton University and lives in Washington, D.C.Praise for <em>IKE'S BLUFF</em>:<br><br>"With grace, insight, and originality, Evan Thomas has written a brilliant and engaging book about the most important of subjects: how close we came to Armageddon in the seemingly placid 1950s. Thomas's Eisenhower is a canny savior, a president who kept the peace through feint and bluff. No one writes more astutely or more honestly than Evan Thomas. This is the work of a master of storytelling at his best."&#x2015;<b>Jon Meacham</b>, <b><i>author of <i>Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power</i></i></b><br><br>"[Thomas's] detailed, engaging pictures of Eisenhower's personality bring him vividly to life. Most important, by the end of the book Thomas has made his case that Dwight Eisenhower's 'greatest victories were the wars he did not fight.' "&#x2015;<b><i><em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"Evan Thomas has written an insightful and penetrating study of my father, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dad was a hard man to know; he played it close to the chest. So despite my extensive exposure to him throughout forty six years, I still found myself learning new aspects, some of which, I must admit, are a bit painful. But the balance that Thomas achieves between Eisenhower the public servant and Eisenhower the man is, in my opinion, as close to the mark as we are likely to see."&#x2015;<b>John Eisenhower</b><br><br>"Evan Thomas's profoundly important book shows how the card-playing general who did as much as anyone to win World War II became the president most adroit at preserving peace. Behind his open smile, Eisenhower was a secretive and subtle leader with quiet moral courage. By projecting confidence while keeping his intentions concealed, he became the model of a nuclear-age peacekeeper. Thomas has produced a fascinating history that is also a brilliant guide to great leadership."&#x2015;<b>Walter Isaacson</b>, <b><i>author of <em>Steve Jobs</em></i></b><br><br>"A bustling, anecdotal book with a high-concept premise. [Thomas] approaches the ever more changeable Eisenhower legacy with new and intriguing questions."&#x2015;<b>Janet Maslin</b>, <b><i><em>The New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"Well-researched and highly readable...Thomas' account is sure to appeal to older readers who can recall the mandatory duck-and-cover drills in the classroom and to others with an interest in a fascinating and pivotal period when the nation was in better hands than many at the time probably realized."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Associated Press</em></i></b><br><br>"[Thomas is] a five-star biographer who blows apart that image [of Ike as a bumbling old man] with devastating detail."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Vanity Fair</em></i></b><br><br>"A thoroughly researched, tightly organized and briskly written biography...Thomas is especially skilled at bringing characters of the era to life..."&#x2015;<b>James Ledbetter</b>, <b><i><em>Washington Post</em></i></b><br><br>"Dwight Eisenhower was a great general and President because he was a great leader, and <i>Ike's Bluff</i> uncracks the code. Evan Thomas's original and fascinating book is an immersion in the Eisenhower School of Leadership, with lessons not only for Presidents and military officers but leaders in other arenas of American life operating in moments of both tranquility and rapid change. Especially in these times, Thomas's book is an essential reminder that strong leadership can be exercised with kindness, morality and respect for opponents."&#x2015;<b>Michael Beschloss</b>, <b><i>author of <i>The Conquerors</i></i></b><br><br>"Thomas has written a book that elucidates Eisenhower's wisdom for general readers."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em></i></b></p><h2>Easy Go</h2><p>Beneath the sands of the Egyptian desert lies treasure beyond imagining. And when a professor of archaeology finds clues to the location of a Pharaoh's lost tomb in ancient hieroglyphs, he hatches a plan to find the burial site - and plunder it.&nbsp;<br><br>But can a five-man team of smugglers and thieves uncover what the centuries have hidden? And even if they find it, can they escape with it...and with their lives?</p><p>Long before he wrote <i>Jurassic Park</i>, before he scripted blockbuster movies like <i>Twister</i>, before he created the groundbreaking TV series <i>ER</i>, Michael Crichton was an honors student at Harvard Medical School - and writing paperback suspense novels on the side, under the top-secret pen name "John Lange." Lange wrote eight books between 1966 and 1972...and then vanished.<br><br>Until, 40 years after John Lange was born, Michael Crichton chose Hard Case Crime to bring him back, personally re-editing two Lange books, even writing new chapters for one of them. Now Hard Case Crime is proud to bring all of John Lange's work back into print for the first time in decades - and the first time ever under Michael Crichton's real name.Originally published under the John Lange pseudonym in 1968, this early Crichton novel is a fast-paced thriller in the pulp style. An archaeology professor learns about a previously undiscovered pharaoh&#x2019;s tomb in Egypt; he puts together a small team, intending to loot the tomb and make himself rich. But, and this should come as no surprise, dissension in the thieves&#x2019; ranks soon puts the professor&#x2019;s plan, not to mention his life, in jeopardy. Crichton published the Lange novels (eight of them in total) between the late 1960s and the early &#x2019;70s. If you didn&#x2019;t know they were written by Crichton, you&#x2019;d have a hard time telling that from the books: the resemblance between a Lange novel and, say, Jurassic Park is so slight as to be insignificant. But it&#x2019;s also worth noting that the Lange novels are great fun, with entertaining characters and exciting stories. Leave it to the author&#x2019;s fans to decide whether they&#x2019;re curiosities or legitimate additions to the Crichton canon. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Little Prince: 25th Anniversary Gift Boxed Edition</h2><p>An aviator whose plane is forced down in the Sahara Desert encounters a little man from a small planet who describes his adventures in the universe seeking the secret of what is really important in life.</p><p>Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exup�ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exup�ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>First published in 1943<br>Previous hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-202398-4<br></p><h2>Dark Forest</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Cixin Liu is China&#39;s #1 SF writer.

To enhance exact identification of insects, the photographs in this encyclopedic reference were taken in the field -- and are not pinned specimens. </p><p> <b>Insects</b> enables readers to identify most insects quickly and accurately. The more than 50 pages of picture keys lead to the appropriate chapter and specific photos to confirm identification. The keys are surprisingly comprehensive and easy for non-specialists to use. </p><p> <b>Insects</b> features:</p><ul> <li>Detailed chapters covering all insect orders and the insect families of eastern North America</li> <li>A brief examination of common families of related terrestrial arthropods</li> <li>4,000 color photographs illustrating typical behaviors and key characteristics</li> <li>28 picture keys for quick and accurate insect identification</li> <li>Three indexes -- common family names, photographs, general index</li> <li>Expert guidance on observing, collecting and photographing insects.</li> </ul><p> Almost 80 percent of all named animal species are insects and closely related arthropods. This book is required reading for anyone interested in entomology. </p></p><p><p> <b>Steve Marshall</b> is a professor of entomology at the University of Guelph, where he developed a major insect collection and carries out research on insect systematics and biodiversity. He has discovered hundreds of new species, several new genera and even two new subfamilies. </p><p><b> Preface </b></p><p> This book is based on material originally gathered in support of a third-year entomology course -- "The Natural History of Insects" -- that I started teaching at University of Guelph in 1982. The text is based on the lecture notes for that course, the picture keys are based on the course manual and the photographs are part of a collection that was initiated to provide color to my lectures in several entomology courses over the past 20 years. </p><p> The text sections in this book provide an introduction to insect diversity and natural history, with basic information about all major insect families. The photos and captions provide a visual overview of the diversity of each family with discussions of common or especially interesting genera and species. Picture keys are provided to the orders and common families of most orders. The emphasis is on northeastern North America, loosely interpreted as anything east of the Mississippi River and north of the state of Georgia. </p><p><b> Insect identification </b></p><p> Although the focus of this book is on the common families of northeastern North American insects, the keys and photos should be useful for identifying orders and most families anywhere in the world. If you are trying to identify an insect to order, start with the illustrated keys (pages 615-666). When you think you have a match, turn to the appropriate section of the book and look over the full spectrum of photos for that order. </p><p> If you know the order and want to identify your insect to the family level you can either jump right to the photos and captions, or start with the illustrated keys. The illustrated keys may not take you right to the family level, but they will guide you to the correct part of the book to look for further information. The photos and captions themselves should serve as a practical field guide to the family or subfamily level for common insects from anywhere in North America, and will serve for positive identification of some eastern insects at the genus or species level. </p><p> Almost all the photographs are of northeastern species, although a few interesting groups that do not occur in the east (honey ants, pollen wasps) were slipped in for interest, and a few groups are illustrated with photos from outside North America, as noted. The great majority of the photographs were taken in Ontario, Canada (mostly the Bruce Peninsula or southern Ontario), but a few are from Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia (where I teach a field entomology course), and elsewhere in the eastern United States. </p><p> The illustrated family keys are designed to be as user-friendly as possible, with an emphasis on characteristics visible to the naked eye or easily discernable with a handheld magnifying glass. Most keys represent a compromise between ease of use and comprehensiveness. The keys in this book lean towards ease of use and should be treated as shortcuts rather than definitive roadmaps. The keys to families in the larger orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) are designed to aid in the identification of typical members of commonly encountered families, and the odd rarity or exception will not key out. Comprehensive keys to the families of these orders are listed in the references, but most require experience, patience and a good microscope to use. For example, the key to families of beetles in American Beetles (Arnett et al., 2002) is 185 complex couplets long; the key to families of flies in the Manual of North American Diptera (McAlpine et al., 1981) is 152 couplets long. Those keys will work for almost all North American beetles and flies; the simplified keys in this book will probably work for over 95 percent, including almost all routinely encountered taxa. I think it is a good compromise, but it is a compromise, and the serious student will want to check problematic identifications using more technical literature. </p><p><b> The "id" and "idae" of entomological jargon </b></p><p> This book is organized around insect orders and families. Names given to orders (big groups, like beetles and flies) do not have standard endings, but orders are divided into families, and the names of families always end in "-idae." Insect families are routinely mentioned by informally contracting the family name to end with "-id." Ground beetles, for example, are formally called the family Carabidae, but are informally referred to as "carabids." Sometimes it is useful to talk about a number of related families together, in which case we talk about superfamilies and the names always end in "-oidea." Some families, especially large families like the leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae), are usefully divided into subgroups called subfamilies (subfamily names end in "-inae"). </p><p> The scientific name of a species always has two parts, the genus (always capitalized and in italics) and species (always in italics, never capitalized). For example, the Monarch Butterfly (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>) is a nymphalid butterfly in the family Nymphalidae and the subfamily Danainae. In scientific papers (but not in this book) the name of a species is usually followed by the name of the person who first described and named it (in parentheses if it was first described in another genus). The Monarch, then, would appear as Danaus plexippus (L.), with L. serving as a short form for its "discoverer" Linnaeus. </p><p> <b>Taxonomic hierarchy and corresponding suffix</b><br> Superfamily: -oidea<br> Family (formal): -idae<br> Family (informal): -id<br> Subfamily: -inae<br> </p><p> Many insect species, especially large or economically important species, have common names like the Monarch, but most do not. Where widely used common names exist they are included here. Common names are normally capitalized. Family names appear in bold face when they first appear in the text. </p><p> Classifications are in constant flux as we discover more about the relationships between groups of organisms, and the names used in this book may be different from those you are already familiar with. I have taken a conservative approach to higher classification, using the family concepts in current usage unless there are compelling reasons to accept a recent change. Significant changes are indicated in the text and captions, and generally follow a recent checklist, catalogue or monograph in the Selected References section at the back of this book. </p><p><b> An Overview of Six-legged Life </b></p><p> We live in a world of insects. They are our continual and closest neighbors, so much a part of day-to-day life that most of us hardly take notice of them unless they are particularly loud or obnoxious, or they stand accused of robbery or assault. It is easy to forget that human beings form a tiny two-legged minority in an overwhelmingly six-legged world -- a world where a bit of knowledge about our dominant neighbors can unlock the door to a surprisingly diverse local environment. The key to seeing and understanding insect diversity is knowledge of the common orders and families of insects. Armed with that knowledge, a sizeable proportion of the multitude of walking, crawling and flying creatures you share your daily life with will become familiar neighbors, replete with predictable habits. </p><p> Insects are influential and interesting creatures well worth getting to know. It is self-evident that you can hardly step outdoors without exposure to a usually ignored infinity of insect types, but surprisingly few people are aware that these ubiquitous animals make up the staggering majority of all living things. Most named species of living things, including close to eighty percent of the approximately one and a half million named animal species, are insects. These numbers would be all the more impressive if they took into account the millions of insect species still awaiting discovery and formal naming. We can only guess that the total number of insect species is somewhere between five and ten million, and we have only the crudest idea of how many individual insects</p></p><h2>Managing</h2><p>The former Chairman of the Board of ITT provides an informative and experienced look at the principles and practices of good business management</p><p>Harold Geneen, former CEO of ITT, the man who built ITT into one of America&#39;s most prominent companies.</p><h2>People of the Black Sun: A People of the Longhouse Novel (North America&#39;s Forgotten Past)</h2><p>Dekanawida has become known as The Sky Messenger, a prophet of immense power, and Hiawento is his Speaker.

It slithered into clothing, stiffened leather, and afflicted bones with agony. Its unnaturally silent voice made ears crave even the slightest sound. The sheer vastness of the frozen land pressed down upon him tonight. <br> <i>What is my offering? What can I give him to help him?</i> <br>When he crested the hill and gazed out across the valley where hundreds of campfires glittered, he took a few moments to contemplate the next few days. He suspected they would be some of the most difficult of his existence. <br>He inhaled a deep breath, and started down the hill toward the warriors who had waged the battle. Frozen flowers hid amid the shriveled leaves on the sides of the trail, dead, folded in upon themselves. <br>As he neared Yellowtail Village, smoke flowed upward from the charred longhouses and obliterated the glittering Path of Souls that painted a white swath across the night sky. His People, the People of the Hills, believed that each person had two souls. One remained with the bones forever. The other, the afterlife soul, stayed on earth for ten days. Then, if it were lucky enough to be properly prepared, it followed the Path of Souls to a long bridge that spanned a dark abyss. On this side of the bridge were all the animals a person had ever known in his life. The animals who had loved him helped him across. Those that he had mistreated chased him, trying to force him to fall off the bridge into eternal darkness. If his animal helpers were strong enough and he made it to the other side, he would be greeted by his ancestors in the Land of the Dead. <br>Some people, however, had trouble finding the Path of Souls. Especially those who died violently. <br>His eyes narrowed. On the battlefield below, dead bodies lay contorting as they froze. There must be thousands of glistening soul lights, lost souls, out there bobbing and swaying in confusion, searching for loved ones to take care of them. If Sonon closed his eyes, he could hear their spectral cries rising. <br>He folded his arms beneath his cape, trying to stay warm while he continued thinking. <br> <i>Yes, maybe&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br>Perhaps the single greatest truth of life was that the dead were not dead. Their shadows lived. They wandered the forests, slept in crackling fires and ancient sycamores, they huddled in grass that wept and stones that whimpered. They were the painted prayersticks that Great Grandmother Earth used to dance life in and out of this world. If humans could only learn to watch shadows pass like a mountain did, they would understand that death was just a whisper. <br>&#x201c;Is that my offering?&#x201d; <br>War songs lilted through the sparkling air, mixing eerily with the sobs and moans coming from the destroyed villages. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said softly, deciding. &#x201c;A glimpse from inside the mountain.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by Kathleen O&#x2019;Neal Gear and W.

He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Sniper&#x2019;s Honor PROLOGUE<p></p> Ostfront<p></p> 1942<p></p> <br>It was a balmy November day in Stalingrad, 14 below, twelve feet of snow, near-blizzard conditions. Another twelve feet were expected soon and tomorrow would be colder. At the intersection of Tauvinskaya and Smarkandskaya streets, near the petrol tanks, not far from the Barrikady Factory, the boulevards were empty of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, though arms, legs, feet shod and unshod, hands gloved and ungloved, even a head or two stuck out of the caked white banks that lined them. A dead dog could be seen there, a dead old lady here. The sky was low and gray, threatening; columns of smoke rose from various energetic encounters in the northern suburb of Spartaskovna a few miles away. A ruined Sd. Kfz 251, painted frosty white for camouflage, lay on its side, its visible track sheared, a splatter of steel wheels all over the street. Its crew had either escaped or been long since devoured by feral dogs and rats. Farther down rusted away a T-34 without a turret, a relic of warmer months, as was presumably its crew. On either side of either street for blocks on end, the buildings had been reduced to devastation and resembled a maze, a secret puzzle of shattered brick, twisted steel, blackened wall, ruptured vehicle. In this labyrinth, small groups of men hunted each other and now and then would spring an ambush and a spasm of rifle or machine-gun fire would erupt, perhaps the blast of a Russian or German grenade. Occasionally a plane would roar overhead, a Sturmovik or a Stuka, like a predator bird looking for something to kill and eat.<br> <br>But for now, the intersection was quiet, though a riot of snow-flakes floated downward, swirling in the wind, covering bloodstains, human entrails, fecal deposits, muffling the screams of men who&#x2019;d lost legs or testicles, the whole panopoly of total, bitter war fought at very close quarters in frozen conditions, under a gossamer surface of silky frost.<br> <br>One man, however, was quite warm and comfortable. He was prone-positioned in what had been Apartment 32, 27 Smarkandskaya Street, a model Soviet worker&#x2019;s building, which now had no roof and few walls. He lay belly-down on three blankets, under three blankets. His face was smeared with zinc ointment as a protection against frostbite, his hands were twice gloved, a white hood engulfed most of his head, and a scarf sheathed his mouth and nose, so that only the eyes, dark behind snow goggles, were visible. Best of all, every half an hour, a private would slither up the stairs and slip a hot water bottle under the blankets, its contents freshly charged from a boiling pot two flights below.<br> <br>The prone man was named Gunther Ramke and he was a feldwebel, a sergeant, in the 3rd Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 44th Infantry Division in XI Corps in the Sixth Army under Paulus, facing the 13th Guards Rifle Division of the Soviet 62nd Army under Zhukov as the heavy fighting of Operation Uranus echoed in the distance. Zhukov was trying desperately to encircle Paulus as a preliminary to destroying him and his three hundred thousand colleagues. None of that mattered to Feldwebel Ramke, who had no imagination for any kind of pictures save the one he saw through his Hensoldt Dialytan four-power telescopic sight, set in a claw mount on his Mauser K98k.<br> <br>He was a sniper, he was hunting a sniper. That was all.<br> <br>The Russian had moved in a few weeks ago, a very talented stalker and shooter, and already had eliminated seven men, two of them SS officers. It was thought that the fellow had worked the Barrikady Factory zone before that, and possibly Memomova Hill. He liked to kill SS. It wasn&#x2019;t that Ramke had any particular investment in the SS, which struck him as ridiculous (he was farm-raised and thought the black costumes were something for the stage or cinema; additionally, he knew nothing of politics except that the Fatherland had been starved into submission in &#x2019;18, then gotten screwed in the Treaty of Versailles), but he was a good soldier, an excellent shot (twenty-nine kills), and he had an assignment and meant to bring it off. It would keep his captain happy, and life was better for everyone in the company, as in all armies that have ever existed anywhere in the world at any time, if the captain was happy.<br> <br>He knew this game was of a dimension he had not yet encountered. Normally you stalk, you slither, you pop up or dip down, and sooner or later a fellow with a Mosin-Nagant or a Red tommy gun comes your way, you settle into position, hold your breath, steady the weapon on bones not muscles, watch the crosshair ooze toward center body, and squeeze. The fellow staggers and falls; or he steps back and falls; or he simply falls; but it always ends in the fall. Plop, to the ground, raising dust or snow, followed by the eternal stillness known only to the dead.<br> <br>But the character on the other side of the street was too good. So the new rules were, you never moved. You emulated the recently deceased. You never looked up or about. Your field of vision was your battlefield, and it covered about thirty feet at 250 meters. You stayed disciplined. The rifle was loaded and cocked so there was no ritual of bolt throw, with its bobbing head and flying elbows, either of which could get you killed. The name of this game was patience. The opponent would come to you. It was a question of waiting. Thus, Gunther was perfectly constituted for the job, being barely literate and lacking any ability to project himself in time or space. He was the ideal sniper: what was, was; he had no need for speculation, delusion, curiosity, or fantasy.<br> <br>He was set up to cover the fifth and sixth floors of a much-battered apartment building across the street and the traffic circle that marked the intersection, with the knees of a statue of someone once important to the Russians still standing on a pedestal. If the enemy sniper was in that tightly circumscribed universe, Gunther would make the kill. If he was a floor lower or higher, or a window to the left or right, they&#x2019;d never encounter each other. Tricky business. Wait, wait, wait.<br> <br>And finally the ordeal seemed to be paying off. He was convinced that within the darkness of the rear of the apartment whose interior was defined by his sight picture lay a patch more intense and more shaped than had been there in previous hours. He convinced himself he saw movement. He just wasn&#x2019;t quite sure, and if he fired and hit nothing, he would give this position up, and he&#x2019;d have to start anew tomorrow.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t want to stare too hard through the glass. Eyestrain and fatigue led to hallucinatory visions, and if he let himself, he&#x2019;d see Joe Stalin sitting in there, eating a plate of sardines and wiping his filthy peasant hands on his tunic. Realizing this as a trap, he closed his eyes every few seconds for some rest, so that he cut down on the pressure. But each time he opened them, he was certain there was a new shape in the shadow. It could have been a samovar on the floor, or the frame of a chair that lost a fight with a mortar round, or even the body of the occupant, but it also could have been a man in prone, hunched similarly over a weapon, eye pressed similarly to the scope. It didn&#x2019;t help that discriminations were made more difficult by reason of an occasional sunbeam that would break through the clouds and throw a shaft of illumination into the room just above the suspected enemy. When this happened, it broke Gunther&#x2019;s concentration and ruined his vision, and he had to blink and look away and wait until the condition passed.<br> <br>But Gunther felt safe. The Ivan snipers used a 3.5-power optic called a PU, which meant that even if his enemy were on him, the details would be so blurry that no sight picture could be made, not at 250 meters, which was about as far as the Mosin-Nagant with that scope was good for. So he felt invisible, even a little godlike. His higher degree of magnification gave him enough advantage.<br> <br>He would wait a little while longer. That low sun would disappear and full dark would come. Both opponents, if there was another opponent, would wait until that happened and then gradually disengage and come back to fight tomorrow. But Gunther had decided to shoot. He&#x2019;d been on this stand a week, and he convinced himself that he was seeing something new, having moved in at about three in the afternoon, and it could only be&#x2014;<br> <br>He closed his eyes. He counted to sixty.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much time left, Gunther,&#x201d; came the call from his Landser, leaning out of the stairwell behind him. &#x201c;Need more hot water?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; said Gunther.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to shoot! Maybe we can get out of here early!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the soldier disappeared, knowing further distraction was to nobody&#x2019;s advantage. Gunther, meanwhile, prepared to fire. He carefully assembled his position behind the rifle, working methodically from toes to head, locking joints, finding angles for his limbs, making nuanced adjustments, building bone trusses under the seven-pound 7.92mm rifle resting on a sandbag, pushing the safety off, sliding his trigger finger out of the sheathing of the two gloves via a slot he&#x2019;d cut in each. He felt the trigger&#x2019;s coldness, felt his fingertip engage it, felt it move back, stacking slightly as it went, until it finally reached the precise edge between firing and not firing. At this point he committed fully by opening his eyes to acquire the picture through the glass of the Hensoldt Dialytan, four times larger than life, and settled the intersection of the crosswires on its center. He exhaled half his breath, put his weight against the trigger, feeling it just about to break, and then saw the flash.<br> <br>The round hit him on a slightly downward angle at the midpoint of his right shoulder, breaking a whole network of bones, though missing any major arteries or blood-bearing organs. It was not fatal. In fact, it saved his life; his shoulder was so ruinously damaged that he was evacuated from Stalingrad that night, one of the last to escape the Cauldron, as it came to be called, full of Paulus&#x2019;s unhappy men. Gunther lived to be eighty-nine years old, dying prosperous and well attended by grandchildren on his farm in Bavaria.<br> <br>However, at the point of impact it felt like someone had unloaded a full-swing ten-kilo sledgeweight against him, lifting him, twisting him, depositing him. He was aware that he had fired in reaction to the trauma but knew full well that the shot, jerked and spastic, had no chance of reaching the target.<br> <br>Dazzled by the shock, he recovered quickly and tried to cock the rifle but found of course that the arm attached to the now-destroyed shoulder no longer worked. Still, on instinct, his face returned to the stock, his eye returned to the scope, and it so happened that his opponent, having delivered the shot, had risen to depart just as one of those errant sunbeams pierced the interior of the room. As the figure rose and turned, the hood fell away and Gunther saw a cascade of yellow hair, bright as gold, reflect in the sunlight. Then the sniper was gone.<br> <br>Men raced to him, tourniquets were supplied and applied, a stretcher was brought, but Gunther said to anybody who would listen, &#x201c;Die weisse Hexe!&#x201d;<br> <br>The White Witch!</p><h2>The Shirley Hughes Collection</h2><p>Shirley Hughes Collection</p><p>Shirley was born in West Kirby, near Liverpool, and studied fashion and dress design at Liverpool Art School, before continuing her studies at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford.

In <i>Nobody Runs Forever</i>, Parker and two cohorts stole the assets of a bank in transit, but the police heat was so great they could only escape if they left the money behind. In this follow-up novel, Parker and his associates plot to reclaim the loot, which they hid in the choir loft of an unused country church. As they implement the plan, people on both sides of the law use the forces at their command to stop Parker and grab the goods for themselves. Though Parker's new getaway van is an old Ford Econoline with "Holy Redeemer Choir" on its doors, his gang is anything <i>but </i>holy, and Parker will do whatever it takes to redeem his prize, no matter who gets hurt in the process. <br><br>.</p><p>Richard Stark has been hailed as one of the inventors-and one of the true masters-of noir crime fiction. Stark's most recent Parker novels, <i>Comeback</i> and <i>Backflash</i>, were each selected as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. His first novel, <i>The Hunter</i>, became the classic 1967 movie <i>Point Blank</i>. Thirty years later, <i>The Hunter</i> was adapted again by Hollywood, in the hit Mel Gibson movie <i>Payback</i>. Richard Stark is also, at times, the mystery Grand Master Donald E. Westlake. To learn more about the author, you can visit www.donaldwestlake.com.&#x201c;Fiercely distracting . . . . Westlake is an expert plotter; and while Parker is a blunt instrument of a human being depicted in rudimentary short grunts of sentences, his take on other characters reveals a writer of great humor and human understanding.&#x201d; (John Hodgman <i>"Parade"</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Parker is as resolute and dangerous as ever.&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The nice thing about the rather nasty stories Stark writes about a career criminal named Parker is that none of the significant characters is ever innocent. Which is why it&#x2019;s so easy to laugh when their intricate schemes begin to unravel. . . . Everyone in this merry misadventure ends up at Bosky Rounds, a quaint bed-and-breakfast that looks like the cover art for <i>Yankee </i>magazine&#x2014;something to bear in mind on leaf-peeing excursions to picturesque New England villages.&#x201d; (Marilyn Stasio <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Slamming through a new crime novel by Westlake&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s hard to drag your feet once the process starts&#x2014;is a little like spelunking in a cave system whose twisted paths lead to fascinating galleries and grottoes, some bright and sparkly, some shadowy and frightening. <i>Dirty Money</i> and the other thrillers Westlake writes under the pseudonym of Richard Stark are of the latter category, an exploration of caverns dark and gritty. But even with the ground shifting under your feet and a sense of foreboding in the air, the experience is compelling and oddly exhilarating. . . . Ever the pro, Parker takes each hitch in stride, keeping his eye on the prize.&#x201d; (Dick Lochte <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Acquaint yourself with Stark&#x2019;s taut, toned brand of noir. . . . There&#x2019;s no denying the force of his storytelling or his flair for caper comedy: wonderfully, Parker and his gang plan to make their getaway in an old Ford Econoline van with &#x2018;Holy Redeemer Choir&#x2019; stenciled on its side.&#x201d; (<i>Guardian</i>)</p><h2>The Son of Laughter</h2><p>A retelling of the Biblical tale of Jacob, father of the twelve tribes of Israel</p><p>"The Bible's account of Jacob is a pungent seed found in a tomb," wrote the poet James Merrill about this novel. "Frederick Buechner has planted it and the result is this beautiful swaying tree of a book." The fact that Merrill was an old friend of Buechner's does not disqualify this eloquent testimony. Indeed, Jacob is powerfully translated here through Buechner's honest and humorous--and cantankerous--voice. We see a living, human character, as always in Buechner's work, whether fiction or nonfiction. From this archetypal tale of feuding brothers he draws a story of family and fear, and a tale of a living God with whom Jacob wrestles in more ways than one. The tale of this life is a rich one: the two wives, Leah and Rachel, the journeys and the dreams--all of it takes on a coloring that is both strange and yet familiar: here is a Jacob both larger than life and yet very much human, very much one of us. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister. He has been a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and was honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Written by three eminent specialists in the United States and three in China, <i>Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting</i> combines the best of both countries' scholarly approaches with new discoveries and illustrations of numerous paintings located in China and previously little known abroad.<p> Insightful, often lively discussions tell the story in six chapters, mostly dynastic, after briefly giving two "approaches" to Chinese painting. History, politics, biography, and training get their proper due and are complemented by often-detailed analyses of individual artworks. Close attention to the text and the 300 color and 25 black-and-white illustrations enable the reader to "see" these paintings--which are often constructed on different perceptual and cultural premises than the post-Renaissance and photographic images by which most Westerners structure their visual vocabulary. The glossary and other tools are welcome aids; the list of artists is organized by period and offers their names in the two most common romanization systems as well as in Chinese characters. And to read James Cahill on the Ni Zan paintings that may at first appear uninviting, or Lang Shaojun on the proportionally numerous 20th-century painters, is a real adventure for both the eye and the mind.</p><p> Anyone with more than a passing interest in one of the world's most esteemed art traditions--be they a Sunday museumgoer or a confirmed lover of the gnarly pines set amidst the towering mountains of the Song-period masters--will want this book in their library. <i>--Joseph N.

For the first time centering her fiction outside the perimeters of the North Dakota reservation she long ago claimed as her singular terrain, Erdrich here creates an entertaining, seductive novel that probes the volatile power of women's love in its many variations. <p>Five very different women have married Jack Mauser, a charming, infuriating schemer whose passion for women never survives the long haul. His first wife, June Kashpaw, dies in a snow bank just hours after their barroom wedding. The second, Eleanor, the clever, neurotic daughter of a circus acrobat and a funeral director, holds onto an unquenchable obsession for her erstwhile husband. Candice is a dentist whose tough business-like veneer hides her vulnerability and hate. The hardened, often unkind Marlis, a lounge singer, bears Jack's only child. And the current wife, Dot, guileless in her devotion, has married despite already having one husband in the state penitentiary. </p><p>These "tales of burning love," recounted with hindsight and irony, evince Jack's unconventional power to beguile and show how he was in many ways a different man with each wife.

Yet his orthodox brethren were convinced tolerance fostered anarchy and courted God&#x2019;s wrath. Banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, Williams purchased land from the Narragansett Indians and laid the foundations for the colony of Rhode Island as a place where Indian and English cultures could flourish side by side, in peace.<br> <br>As the seventeenth century wore on, a steadily deepening antagonism developed between an expansionist, aggressive Puritan culture and an increasingly vulnerable, politically divided Indian population. Indian tribes that had been at the center of the New England communities found themselves shunted off to the margins of the region. By the 1660s, all the major Indian peoples in southern New England had come to accept English authority, either tacitly or explicitly. All, except one: the Narragansetts.<br> <br>In <i>God, War, and Providence</i> &#x201c;James A.

The Indian importunes the settlers to &#x201c;come over and help us.&#x201d; Civilizing and Christianizing the Indians was one of the major rationales for the Bay Colony, but many of the funds designated for Indian instruction were diverted to other projects.<br><br><br> <br>By 1635, two colonies of English Puritans, Plymouth Plantation and Massachusetts Bay Colony, were firmly established along the coast of southern New England. A third colony, made up of perhaps a hundred recent �migr�s from Massachusetts and a handful of Plymouth Colony traders, had begun to take shape on the banks of the Connecticut River near the modern city of Hartford, where the Dutch had earlier established a bustling trading post.<br> <br>The Pilgrims of Plymouth had first arrived in November 1620 aboard the Mayflower. After an extremely hard first winter, during which almost half of the initial one hundred settlers had perished, the plantation&#x2014;a common seventeenth-century synonym for colony&#x2014;had grown slowly but steadily to self-sufficiency, thanks in large measure to the able assistance of local native inhabitants, especially Squanto, an English-speaking Indian from the deserted Patuxet village upon which Plymouth was settled, and Massasoit, chief sachem of the Wampanoag confederation. By 1635, Plymouth&#x2019;s population stood at six hundred.<br> <br>Squanto had been captured by English explorers around 1614 and taken to Spain to be sold as a slave. He somehow escaped to England and learned the language before being brought back to New England by the merchant Thomas Dermer. All his fellow Patuxets had either died in the epidemic of 1616&#x2013;19 or fled in its wake. In 1621, Governor William Bradford signed an alliance with Massasoit, granting the tribe exclusive trading rights with the colony, and providing for mutual defense in the not unlikely event of attack from one of the many other Indian tribes in the region.<br> <br>Massachusetts Bay colonists first settled in the town of Salem, sixty miles north of Plymouth, in 1628, but by the early 1630s, Boston, with its excellent natural harbor, had become the center of colony government and the most populous English town in New England. The contemporary English chronicler William Wood described Boston as &#x201c;a peninsula hemmed in on the south side with the Bay of Roxbury, on the north side with the Charles River,&#x201d; and &#x201c;not troubled with the great annoyances of wolves, rattlesnakes, and mosquitoes.&#x201d;1 Seven years after its founding, Massachusetts Bay Colony was home to six thousand English people, a good number in Boston itself, the rest dispersed in a handful of small towns ringing Boston proper.<br> <br>Before the end of the decade, another five thousand English people would brave the Atlantic to settle in New England. Most settled in Massachusetts, which by 1640 had firmly established itself as the dominant and most dynamic of four New England Puritan colonies: Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and tiny New Haven, along the Quinnipiac River, destined to fold into Connecticut in 1662.<br> <br>Like Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay had been settled on lands cleared and formerly inhabited by Indians&#x2014;in this case, Massachusetts Indians under the sachem Cutshamakin, and the Pawtuckets under Sagamores John and James. By 1635, the Wampanoags numbered no more than five hundred; the Pawtucket and Massachusetts less than half that number. The great epidemic of 1616&#x2013;19 had reduced the population of both tribes by as much as 90 percent, and then an outbreak of smallpox in 1633 further reduced their numbers. All these tribes welcomed the newcomers as trading partners, neighbors, and allies who could aid them in turning back raiding parties of the fierce Micmac tribe from northern New England.<br> <br>The first English settlements of southern New England were surrounded by many other independent Indian bands and several confederations of bands&#x2014;a grand total, it seems, of fifteen thousand to twenty thousand Indians. The natives spoke slightly different dialects of the same eastern Algonquian language and possessed similar cultures and patterns of subsistence and settlement.<br> <br>To the west of the traditional lands of the Massachusetts and extending into contemporary northwest Rhode Island were the Nipmucks. Farther west, in the northern Connecticut River valley, dwelled about a thousand Pocumtucks. South of the Pocumtucks, in the Connecticut River valley, lived the Podunks, Sequins, Wangunks, and several other small but strategically significant bands, referred to collectively as River Indians by the English.<br> <br>East of the River Indians, centered on the Thames and Mystic River valleys respectively, were some three thousand Mohegans and the Pequots. To the east of the Pequots lay the Narragansett confederation. Its territory extended over the entire mainland of contemporary Rhode Island except for its northwest corner; the East Bay, inhabited by Wampanoags; and the larger islands in Narragansett Bay. Their confederation was the largest and most prosperous Indian polity in the region, numbering between seventy-five hundred and ten thousand people.<br> <br> <br>Southern New England, showing locations of major tribes and colonial boundaries, circa 1660.<br><br>THE LUSH NARRAGANSETT WORLD<br> <br>Evidence of habitation near the Bay goes back about thirty-seven hundred years, and the remains of a Narragansett village dating from AD 1100 to 1300 have been uncovered by archaeologists recently. Narragansett Bay and its environs were extraordinarily rich in natural resources at the time of the first English settlements in New England. The Indians who dwelled there were masters of all the skills needed to exploit them. Contemporary English observers describe the Narragansetts as peaceable, industrious, and well led by an older sachem of few words and considerable wisdom called Canonicus, and his nephew Miantonomi, who by 1635 had already established a reputation in the region as a discerning and intelligent diplomat.<br> <br>The first European to encounter the Narragansetts and record his observations was the great Italian navigator-explorer Giovanni da Verrazano, who sailed the eastern seaboard of America on behalf of the king of France in a futile search for a Northwest Passage. Even in 1524, the Narragansett predilection for industry and trade was evident. Verrazano&#x2019;s account of his encounter with the tribe is remarkably vivid in detail and bears repeating at length:<br> <br>We . . . proceeded to another place, fifteen leagues distant from [Block Island], where we found an excellent harbor [Newport]. Before entering it, we saw about twenty small boats full of people, who came about our ship, uttering many cries of astonishment. . . . Stopping, they looked at the structure of our ship, our persons and dress, afterwards they all raised a loud shout, signifying that they were pleased. . . . Among them were two kings more beautiful in form and stature than can possibly be described; one was about forty years old, the other about twenty-four, and they were dressed in the following manner: The oldest had a deer&#x2019;s skin around his body, artificially wrought in damask figures, his head was without covering, his hair was tied back in various knots; around his neck he wore a large chain ornamented with many stones of different colors. The young man was similar in appearance.<br> <br>This is the finest looking tribe, and the handsomest in their costumes, we have found in our voyage. They exceed us in size, and they are of a very fair complexion; some of them incline more to a white and others to a tawny color; their faces are sharp; their hair long and black, upon the adorning of which they bestow great pains; their eyes are black and sharp, their expression mild and pleasant. . . .<br> <br>They are very generous, giving away whatever they have. . . . We often went five or six leagues into the interior, and found country as pleasant as is possible to conceive, adapted to cultivation of every kind, whether of corn, wine, or oil; there are open plains twenty-five or thirty leagues in extent, entire free from trees or other hindrances. . . . The animals, which are in great numbers . . . are taken in snares, and by bows, the latter being their chief implement.2<br> <br>The word Narragansett as used in this book has two distinct but closely related meanings. It refers in its narrower sense to a core group of some four thousand Indians dispersed in as many as twenty villages throughout the southern half of the Rhode Island mainland, and in a broader sense to a larger political entity known to the English of the seventeenth century as a great sachemdom&#x2014;a loose confederation of Indian bands and tribes. The Narragansett confederation took in the Narragansetts themselves and a number of tributary tribes, including the Cowesett and Shawomet to the north, some Nipmuck bands to the northwest, and the Eastern Niantic to the south, in the areas we now know as Westerly and Charlestown, Rhode Island. Ties of kinship between the Narragansetts and the Eastern Niantics were especially strong.<br> <br>All these tribes had close social and commercial ties to the Narragansetts, but each had its own sachem&#x2014;often called a minor, or local, sachem by the English. He, or, in a handful of cases, she, was responsible for governing the internal affairs of the group. The independence of the local sachems in the Narragansett confederation had begun to diminish somewhat in the 1620s, as trade with the Dutch and the English became an increasingly important source of wealth for the Indians. By the mid-1630s, an emerging Indian-English-Dutch market economy, centered largely on the exchange of furs and foodstuffs for European goods, led to the concentration of political and commercial authority in the hands of Canonicus and Miantonomi.<br> <br>Algonquian sachems, Narragansett and otherwise, almost always owed their positions to family descent. It fell to the great sachem to make all the critical decisions for his subjects, albeit with the advice of the minor sachems, a council of elders, and one or more powwows&#x2014;men who presided over various rituals and tended to both the spiritual and bodily health of the people. Indians looked to their great sachem to dispense justice, mediate disputes between bands, allocate farming and hunting lands, conduct diplomacy with outsiders, and organize group activities, especially the seasonal migrations between the coast and the inland forests, and warfare. In exchange for protection and leadership, Miantonomi and Canonicus received allegiance and payments from their tributaries, as well as from their own local bands in the villages of southern Rhode Island.<br> <br>Allegiance to the great sachem, however, was contingent on his ability to keep the local sachems and their subjects reasonably content through gift-giving and consensus building, and responsive leadership. Disaffected minor chiefs could alter the balance of power between the major Indian tribes by shifting their allegiance from one great sachem to another.<br> <br>Political and social ties among the Algonquians were protean&#x2014;which caused no small amount of confusion and frustration for Europeans. When individual Indians in Narragansett territory committed criminal acts or violated Indian-Puritan agreements, the English authorities would customarily go over the heads of the local sachems and seek satisfaction from Canonicus and Miantonomi directly. Much to the frustration of the English authorities, their ability to do so was often circumscribed by the power minor sachems enjoyed over members of their own bands, as well as by the ease with which unattached males, and even on occasion entire nuclear families, could migrate from one band to another.<br> <br>The Narragansetts, like all southern New England Indians, were farmers and fishermen as well as hunters and gatherers. Each spring men and women worked together to clear new fields close to the coastline, cutting down trees, and breaking up the soil with clamshells and stone hoes. Women planted, nurtured, and harvested the staple crops of squash, beans, and corn, and they gathered fruit, nuts, and plants for both sustenance and medicinal purposes.<br> <br>Puritans stereotyped Indian men as lazy, yet it&#x2019;s clear that men took on the hard labor of clearing the fields when new farming plots were needed. Narragansett men were also skilled trappers and hunters of deer, rabbits, beaver, and otter. Deer was by far the most important source of meat for the tribe. In the winter, hunting parties of as many as several hundred men roamed the forest, driving deer in the direction of a large V-shaped, funneled trap leading to a corral, where they could be easily dispatched with bow and arrow. Before the hunt, carefully controlled fires were set to clear away underbrush. While the cleared ground made hunting quite a bit easier, it did no permanent harm to the maple, oak, cedar, and pine trees. In fact, by decreasing the competition for nutrients in the soil, it enhanced the growth of the larger trees.<br> <br>Pigeons, waterfowl, and turkeys formed a regular part of the Narragansett Indian diet and were found in numbers that astonished the English. Men fished with weirs, nets, and harpoons, both in Narragansett Bay proper and in the many fresh- and saltwater ponds and rivers in their territory. Shellfish, quahogs, and mussels were collected along the shoreline, usually by women, throughout the year.<br> <br>Seaworthy dugout canoes carved out of the trunks of large hardwood trees were used for open-water fishing and travel between the mainland of Narragansett country and the islands in the Bay. These craft could transport as many as thirty Indians across miles of open ocean, even in blustery seas. The canoes were among the most striking examples of an Indian technology that proved far superior to its English counterpart in the New World environment. Roger Williams reported that the Narragansetts even knew how to rig a sail made of English cloth on a small pole in their canoes to gain speed.<br> <br>Despite the hunting prowess of Narragansett men, corn was the staple of the tribe&#x2019;s diet. It was consumed in stews with beans, squash, fish, and meat. Cakes were also made from cornmeal, which was stored for winter consumption in great quantities in baskets buried in the ground.<br> <br>Among the many groups of Algonquian Indians, the Narragansett distinguished themselves not only as traders, but as manufacturers. Narragansett baskets, woven by women, were highly prized throughout the region. Women prepared furs for both personal clothing and for trade. Men fashioned widely regarded pipes for tobacco they grew for their own consumption, as well as axes, chisels, hoes, and arrows made of stone and, later, European metals.<br> <br>The coastline of Narragansett country was overrun with quahog and whelk, the raw material used for drilling and minting shell beads called wampum. Wampum had great symbolic and ceremonial value to all Algonquians long before Europeans arrived on the scene. It was given as tribute, to confirm agreements between native peoples, and worn as jewelry by individuals to designate authority and prestige. Shortly after the first English settlements in New England took root, wampum became the chief medium of exchange in the em...</p><h2>Kaz the Minotaur (Dragonlance: Heroes)</h2><p><i>But, the beast-man, scorned and hunted, knows, </i><br><i>Without honor there is nothing, not even death. </i><br><i>So, driven by the only ghosts that matter, Huma and himself, Kaz alone faces the scourge.</i><br><br>After the defeat of the Dark Queen and the death of Huma Dragonbane, the most famous of the Knights of Solamnia, Kaz, the renegade minotaur, wanders throught Krynn, telling the true tale of the land's most legendary hero, stalked by his enemies -- a haunted soul, an outcast, a hero.

Instead, it saved those democracies&#x2014;but with a fateful cost. Now, in a &#x201c;complex history rendered with great color and sympathy&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review), Jay Winik captures the epic images and extraordinary history &#x201c;with cinematic force&#x201d; (<i>Time)</i>.<br> <br>1944 witnessed a series of titanic events: FDR at the pinnacle of his wartime leadership as well as his reelection, the unprecedented D-Day invasion, the liberation of Paris, and the tumultuous conferences that finally shaped the coming peace. But millions of lives were at stake as President Roosevelt learned about Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution. Just as the Allies were landing in Normandy, the Nazis were accelerating the killing of millions of European Jews. Winik shows how escalating pressures fell on an infirm Roosevelt, who faced a momentous decision. Was winning the war the best way to rescue the Jews? Or would it get in the way of defeating Hitler? In a year when even the most audacious undertakings were within the world&#x2019;s reach, one challenge&#x2014;saving Europe&#x2019;s Jews&#x2014;seemed to remain beyond Roosevelt&#x2019;s grasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Compelling....This dramatic account highlights what too often has been glossed over&#x2014;that as nobly as the Greatest Generation fought under FDR&#x2019;s command, America could well have done more to thwart Nazi aggression&#x201d; (<i>The Boston Globe</i>).

Throughout the fall of 1943, the president used his vaunted charm and charisma to push for the three Allied leaders&#x2014;himself, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin&#x2014;to meet almost anywhere else. The conference, their first ever, had been a year in the making, and now, before it even commenced, it seemed on the brink of failure over the thorny question of where it would take place.<br> <br>Dispatched on a visit to Moscow, Secretary of State Cordell Hull had proposed the Iraqi port city of Basra, to which Roosevelt could easily travel by ship. Roosevelt himself suggested Cairo, Baghdad, or Asmara, Italy&#x2019;s former Eritrean capital on Africa&#x2019;s east coast; all these were locations, the president pointed out, where he could easily remain in constant contact with Washington, D.C. as was necessary for his wartime stewardship. But the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, was unmoved. He countered that as commander of the Soviet armed forces he could not be out of contact with his deputies in Moscow. He maintained that Tehran, at the foot of the Elburz Mountains, had telegraph and telephone links with Moscow. &#x201c;My colleagues insist on Teheran,&#x201d; he bluntly cabled to Roosevelt in reply, adding that he would however accept a late-November date for the meeting and that he also agreed with the American and British decision to exclude all members of the press.<br> <br>Roosevelt, still hoping to sway the man he referred to as &#x201c;Uncle Joe,&#x201d; cabled again about Basra, saying, &#x201c;I am begging you to remember that I also have a great obligation to the American government and to maintain the full American war effort.&#x201d; The answer from Moscow was brief and direct: no. Stalin was adamant, and he now hinted that he might back out of the entire arrangement for a tripartite conference. Not until Roosevelt was preparing to set sail across the Atlantic en route to the Mediterranean did Stalin, having gotten his way on Tehran, finally acquiesce. Roosevelt promptly cabled to Winston Churchill, &#x201c;I have just heard that Uncle J will come to Teheran.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was in some doubt as to whether he would go through with his former offer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I think that now there is no question that you and I can meet him.&#x201d;<br> <br>So it was that at the Cairo West Airport a little past 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, November 27, Roosevelt boarded the Sacred Cow, a gleaming silver Douglas C54 Skymaster that could carry forty-nine passengers and a three-man crew, for the final leg of his momentous journey; in total, he would travel 17,442 miles, crossing and recrossing nearly eight time zones. For his part, Joseph Stalin simply had to travel due south from Moscow; his round-trip would be only 3,000 miles. But all this seemed forgotten as, for the first time in over four years of war, the leaders of the three great powers were at last to meet, face-to-face, to establish policies designed to bring the carnage to a close. This would be the most important conference of the conflict. As Churchill later wrote, &#x201c;The difficulties of the American Constitution, Roosevelt&#x2019;s health, and Stalin&#x2019;s obduracy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were all swept away by the inexorable need of a triple meeting and the failure of every other alternative but a flight to Tehran. So we sailed off into the air from Cairo at the crack of dawn.&#x201d;<br> <br>It is difficult, in retrospect, to appreciate the magnitude of this trip, or even how bold it was. The wheelchair-bound president of the United States was flying across the Middle East in wartime, unaccompanied by military aircraft and not even in his own plane. The first official presidential airplane, nicknamed Guess Where II, was nothing more than a reconfigured B24 bomber, designated a C87A Liberator; and in any case Roosevelt never used it. After another C87A crashed and the design was found to have an alarming risk of fire&#x2014;which Roosevelt dreaded&#x2014;Guess Where II was quietly pulled from the presidential service. Eleanor Roosevelt took the plane on a goodwill tour of Latin America, and the senior White House staff flew on it, but not the president.<br> <br>Furthermore, Franklin Roosevelt hated to fly.<br> <br>The paraplegic president preferred almost any mode of travel on solid ground, but even here, he had qualms: for one thing, he could not bear to ride in a train that traveled faster than thirty miles an hour. His presidential train made him feel especially secure: it had a special suspension to support his lower body, its walls were armored, and the glass was bulletproof. An accomplished sailor, he also felt comfortable on the water, where he could master the pitch and swell of the waves. But flying was an entirely different matter, and one not without considerable personal risk. Even simple turbulence was problematic because the president &#x201c;could never brace himself against the bumps and jolts with his legs as we could,&#x201d; recalled Mike Reilly, head of Roosevelt&#x2019;s Secret Service detail. And Roosevelt knew better than anyone else how he was limited by his useless legs&#x2014;he would have no chance of crawling away from even a minor plane wreck.<br> <br>Before the Cairo-to-Tehran flight, Roosevelt had made only two other airplane journeys. One was a 1932 flight to Chicago to accept the Democratic nomination for the presidency, during which all the passengers except Roosevelt and his grown son, Elliott, succumbed to airsickness. Before takeoff, mechanics had helpfully removed one of the seats to provide more room, but none of the passengers had seatbelts, so they had to cling to the upholstered arms of their aluminum chairs or risk being tossed about when the plane hit turbulence. The interior noise from the engines was deafening, and the plane&#x2019;s top speed was just over a hundred miles per hour. Two military aircraft providing an escort as well as a chartered plane carrying reporters turned back in the face of thunderstorms and heavy headwinds, while the plane carrying Roosevelt soldiered on. Then, in January 1943, Roosevelt again took to the skies to meet with Churchill in Casablanca. His party of eight departed from Miami in a forty-passenger plane, the Dixie Clipper, which leapfrogged south across the Caribbean to Brazil and then spent nineteen hours making the 2,500-mile Atlantic crossing from South America to West Africa. The clipper planes, although they had spacious cabins and sleeping quarters including a double bed for Roosevelt, were unpressurized, and at the higher altitudes the president would turn pale, sometimes needing to inhale supplemental oxygen. Indeed, the flight to Casablanca, the first airplane trip by an incumbent president, did not make him any more of a convert to flying. As Roosevelt wrote to his wife, Eleanor, who was by contrast an enthusiastic flier, &#x201c;You can have your clouds. They bore me.&#x201d;<br> <br>But here he was, only ten months later, aloft again, this time in the Sacred Cow.<br> <br>The 1,300-mile journey that morning took Roosevelt east, roaring through the brilliant sunshine across the Suez Canal and the vast expanses of the Sinai desert; the pilot then dipped down to circle low over the holy cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem, glistening in the morning&#x2019;s rays. Next, the plane soared over chains of ancient wadis, followed by the hallowed ground of Masada, the rugged fortress in the Judaean hills where a small band of Jews chose death rather than slavery, outlasting an entire Roman legion for nearly three months in the spring of A.D. 73. When the plane reached Baghdad, it turned northeast, where the pilot raced along the Abadan&#x2013;Tehran highway, guiding the plane through a tricky series of jagged mountain passes. There was no alternative: the plane needed to stay below six thousand feet to keep the oxygen level stable for the president. As Roosevelt peered out the plane&#x2019;s window, the land below was a chain of mountains rising from a rocky desert, resembling a brown, faded moonscape. It was isolated and empty, except for the exhilarating sight of trains and truck convoys loaded with American-made war mat�riel, all headed north to the eastern front.<br> <br><br> <br>SIX AND A HALF hours later, the president&#x2019;s plane landed at 3 p.m. at a Red Army airfield in Tehran. Stalin was already waiting. He had arrived in the city twenty-four hours before the British and the Americans and was ensconced at the Russian legation, where he had personally overseen the bugging of a suite of private rooms where the American president would eventually stay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shabby&#x201d; was how Elliott Roosevelt, the president&#x2019;s son, described Tehran in late November 1943. The Iranian capital was almost literally a cesspool. Except at the American, Soviet, and British legations, running water was practically nonexistent. Residents and visitors alike scooped their drinking water from a stream that ran along the street gutter, the same stream that also served as the city&#x2019;s sewage disposal system. Downtown, much of the public drinking water was contaminated with refuse and offal; each sip risked typhus or dysentery, and outbreaks of typhoid fever were common. The city was unappealing in other ways as well. It was occupied by Allied forces, and even the most basic goods were in short supply; a year&#x2019;s salary might be spent on a sack of flour.<br> <br>Nor was the city a glamorous place, able to recall a storied past. Among world capitals, Tehran was&#x2014;surprisingly&#x2014;almost as much of a newcomer as the young Washington, D.C., had been at its inception, when it was little more than a charming semirural landscape derided as a city of &#x201c;magnificent distances.&#x201d; By contrast, in 1800, Tehran&#x2019;s total population of about twenty thousand had lived inside twenty-foot-high mud walls, which were bounded by a forty-foot-wide moat as deep as thirty feet.<br> <br>The entire city itself was accessible by a total of four gates. By 1943, the gates had been pulled down, and a newer city had sprung up beyond the original walls. Gone were many of the quaint old houses that had faced an intricate series of elaborate courtyards and fabled Persian gardens; gone were the donkey carts laden with dates and figs and honey and henna en route to the bustling markets. Instead, newer homes looked outward toward wide main streets designed to accommodate automobiles, trucks, and the occasional horse or wheelbarrow. And beyond its modern boulevards, the city emptied out into a vast, barren space with little more than grazing land and oil fields.<br> <br>The drive from the airfield to downtown Tehran was far from tranquil. The route took the leaders and the accompanying aides through long stretches of curious onlookers and many miles of unprotected road. Before arriving forty-five minutes after the Americans, Winston Churchill, like Roosevelt before him, had endured a potentially deadly journey not unlike that of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 through the streets of Sarajevo. Churchill&#x2019;s daughter, Sarah, who was with him, thought the drive &#x201c;spine-chilling.&#x201d; The roads were rough, the crowds were ubiquitous, and there was only the barest security. Churchill himself drily remarked, &#x201c;If it had been planned out beforehand to run the greatest risks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the problem could not have been solved more perfectly.&#x201d; The prime minister and his daughter were traveling in an unsecured car, while their British security detail followed in a closed jeep, too far behind to be of much use should trouble arise.<br> <br>The route into the city was lined with magnificent white horses of the Persian cavalry&#x2014;in Tehran itself, crowds four or five people deep thronged in between the gleaming animals. Meanwhile, the Allied security details constantly feared a well-lobbed grenade or a pistol shot, and for good reason: near the end of the drive, the British car came to a halt in traffic and curious Iranians swarmed the vehicle. Undaunted, Churchill kept smiling at the crowd until the traffic parted and he was under way again. Once he reached his embassy, tightly guarded by a regiment of Indian Sikhs, he brushed off any meetings and went directly to bed, with a fifth of scotch whisky and a mound of hot-water bottles.<br> <br>As Churchill took to his bed, Roosevelt was spending his first and only night at the residence of the American minister on the outskirts of Tehran. The residence was about four miles from the Soviet and British embassies, which were nearly adjoining in the center of the city. The American embassy itself was a mile away, so either Roosevelt or Stalin and Churchill would have to travel through Tehran&#x2019;s unpredictable streets just to meet. Whether because of paranoia, fear of assassination, or perfidy, Stalin seemed particularly unwilling to make the trip to the American residence. In fact, on the day of Roosevelt&#x2019;s arrival, he turned down the president&#x2019;s invitation to dinner, pleading exhaustion.<br> <br>Instead, as Roosevelt was settling in, the Soviets anxiously reported to the Americans that their intelligence services had discovered an assassination plot against some or all of the leaders at the conference. The Soviet NKVD, forerunner of the KGB (state security committee), claimed that thirty-eight Nazi paratroopers had been dropped inside Russian territory around Tehran; only thirty-two were now accounted for, yet six remained missing, and these had a radio transmitter. Was this a genuine concern, or was it fabricated by the Soviets? That was unclear. In any event, to prevent a problem, Stalin offered Roosevelt a suite of rooms at the heavily guarded Soviet complex for the remainder of the time in Tehran. This was actually Stalin&#x2019;s second such invitation. The first Roosevelt had politely declined through an envoy. This time the president accepted. The following day he moved his personal staff to the large Soviet complex. Outwardly, Roosevelt displayed little concern; not so his Secret Service. Very much worried about the apparent German threat, the Secret Service agents lined the entire main route with soldiers and then sent out a heavily armed decoy convoy of cars and jeeps. As soon as this cavalcade had departed and was slowly making its way through Tehran&#x2019;s central streets, Roosevelt was hustled into another car with a single jeep escort and was sent &#x201c;tearing&#x201d; through the ancient side streets of Tehran to the Soviet legation. Roosevelt was highly amused by what he called the &#x201c;cops and robbers stuff,&#x201d; but his protection agents, who knew better, were terrified.<br> <br>Once inside the Soviet compound, the American Secret Service agents quickly discovered that they were very much outnumbered. Across Tehran, some three thousand NKVD agents had already been deployed for Stalin&#x2019;s personal protection. And nowhere was this more apparent than inside the Soviet residence. &#x201c;Everywhere you went,&#x201d; agent Mike Reilly noted, &#x201c;you would see a brute of a man in a lackey&#x2019;s white coat busily polishing immaculate glass or dusting dustless furniture. As their arms swung to dust or polish, the clear, cold outline of a Luger automatic could be seen on every hip.&#x201d; Actually, even Scotland Yard had sent far more protection for Churchill than the Americans had sent for Roosevelt.<br> <br><br> <br>FINALLY, THE TEHRAN CONFERENCE of the Allied powers could open. In the next few days, the three leaders and their military men would do no less than chart the Allied course for the remainder of the war, as well as begin to define the outlines of the peace. Yet like the Americans&#x2019; security arrangements, the summit was to be almost entirely improvised. The Americans had arrived without even a provision for keeping the minutes of the high-level meetings. To address this glaring oversight, four soldiers with stenographic skills were hastily plucked from the nearby American military camp and assigned to take di...</p><h2>Starting With Watercolor</h2><p>A comprehensive guide to the various techniques of watercolor, including information on sketching, composition, and gouache.</p><p></p><h2>Painting Houses, Cottages and Towns on Rocks</h2><p>Transform ordinary rocks into amazing little houses and cottages.

A contemporary journalist writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives us a record of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally siezed power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and the chance comments of bystanders set against an idealized backcloth of the proletariat soldiers, sailors, and peasants uniting to throw off oppression, Reed&#39;s account is the product of passionate involvement.</p><p>The situation in St. Petersburg was growing more and more tense. The People's Revolution had begun by overthrowing the corrupt Tsarist regime in March 1917, but the workers and the peasants felt the revolution had much farther to go. Tired of fighting a war that meant little to them, the soldiers also grew restless: "When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to the workers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we have something to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"<p> Lenin pressed the Bolsheviks to seize power. On the night of October 24, an organized mass of workers, soldiers, peasants, and sailors stormed the Winter Palace. On the following day, at the opening of the second Congress of Soviets, Trotsky announced the overthrow of the provisional government. Counterrevolutionary forces marched on the capital, but the Revolutionary Army triumphed. After all, "[t]his was <i>their</i> battle, for <i>their</i> world; the officers in command were elected by <i>them</i>. For the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will."</p><p> In <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> John Reed tells the story of Red October and the Russian revolution from a unique, firsthand perspective. Reed, an American journalist, was on assignment in Russia for <i>The Masses</i>--then the principal radical journal in the United States--and spent his days walking the streets, reading and collecting handbills, newspapers, and posters, and talking to people. As a result, <i>Ten Days</i> crackles with energetic immediacy. At its best moments it reads like a novel: Reed recounts conversations and arguments, details political machinations, and speculates on personal motives. Though this is no mere piece of propaganda, Reed's enthusiasm for the revolution infuses the text (some readers may be put off by Reed's florid prose), casting each counterrevolutionary act in a negative light. Helpful notes flesh out the background for those less familiar with the preceding events and render this a solid work of history. <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> is a stirring account of a stirring event. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>John Reed (1887-1920)</b> was a journalist, activist, poet, and author.

A publishing event of major importance!</p><p>updated e-mail address (August, 2000)Mary@Webster.orgNumber 1: Call to Citizens to Study New Constitution [excerpt] <p> Having experienced the undeniable inefficiency of the existing federal government, you are asked to study and consider adopting a new Constitution for the United States of America. </p><p> The importance of this deliberation can not be overstated. The very existence of our country hangs in the balance, as does the safety and welfare of its people, communities, and states. We are called to decide the fate of a nation that is, in many respects, the most interesting in the world. </p><p> It has been often said that the people of this country will decide the important question of whether societies can establish a good government by careful thought and choice. Or whether people are forever destined to be governed only by accident and force. If this is true, the answer depends on our response to the current crisis. And a wrong decision deserves to be considered a misfortune for all mankind. </p><p>Variety of Interests Influence Debate<br> [2] Conscientious patriots understand the weighty importance of deciding whether to adopt the new Constitution. Knowing their decision will affect all human societies raises their anxiety. </p><p> It would be wonderful if we based our decision only on the best interests of our society, unbiased by less noble interests unconnected with the public good. Although we may ardently wish this, it can't be seriously expected. The Constitution offered for consideration affects too many special interests and changes too many local institutions not to expect discussions on subjects other than its merits. Views, passions and prejudices unrelated to discovering the truth and meaning of the document are expected. </p><p>Opposition From Politicians<br> [3] Politicians will present some of the most formidable obstacles to the new Constitution. Some will resist any change that might diminish the power and benefits of their current State offices. The perverted ambition of others will see potential self-aggrandizement within a country in disarray. Or will flatter themselves into believing they can rise to a higher livel of power within an alliance of several States than within a union under one government. </p><p>Moderation Urged<br> [4] However, I don't plan to dwell on observations of this nature. It would be presumptuous for me to indiscriminately declare a person's opposition due to self-interest or ambitious views merely because their situation might subject them to suspicion. Candidly, we admit even politicians may be motivated by upright intentions. And, undoubtedly, much of the opposition will spring from blameless, if not valid, motivations. Preconceived jealousies and fears will lead arguments astray into honest errors in thinking. </p><p> Indeed, so many powerful reasons can create a false bias that there are often wise and good men arguing on both the wrong and right side of society's most important questions. This reality should furnish a lesson of moderation to anyone who thinks they are always right in any controversy. </p><p> A further reason for caution--we are not always sure that people who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives no more laudable than these, operate as well on those who support, as those who oppose, the right side of a question. </p><p> Moderation is important. Nothing is more repugnant than the intolerant spirit that has, at all times, characterized political parties. In politics, as in religion, it's absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution. </p><p>Constitution Called Thief of Liberty<br> [5] Despite these arguments, a torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose about this subject, as in all former cases of great national debate. To judge from the conduct of the opponents of the new Constitution, we will conclude that they hope to show evidence of the justness of their opinions and increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their rhetoric and the bitterness of their denunciations. </p><p> Those who argue with enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be demonized as being fond of despotic power and hostile to liberty. When supporters profess that the rights of the people must be scrupulously protected, it will be characterized as insincere, a blatant bid for popularity at the expense of the public good. </p><p> It will be forgotten that dangers to the rights of people most commonly spring from the head rather than the heart, that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with narrow-minded bigotry and distrust. </p><p> It will also be forgotten that a vital government is essential to secure liberty. Sound judgment shows these can never be separated. And dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the zeal for a firm and efficient government. History teaches us that of the men who have overturned the liberties of republics, most began their career by proclaiming their devotion to the people. They gain position by arousing people's prejudices and end as tyrants.</p></p><h2>The Shortest History of Europe</h2><p>Shortest-History-of-Europe</p><p>John Hirst is a widely respected historian and social commentator. A former reader in history at La Trobe University, he is a member of the Film Australia Board and the National Museum council. He is the author of numerous books, including The Sentimental Nation, A Republican Manifesto, Australia&#39;s Democracy: A Short History, The Australians: Insiders and Outsiders on the National Character since 1770 and Freedom on the Fatal Shore: Australia&#39;s First Colony.Crisp, lucid and evocative --Australian Book Review</p><h2>A New History of the American West , &#34;It&#39;s Your Misfortune and None of My Own &#34;</h2><p>Argues that each succeeding group to occupy the American West exploited the land and native inhabitants to reap short term financial benefits</p><p>"It's your misfortune and none of my own," the line from a song, sets the tone for this sweeping account of the West from the early European incursions to the present. White, a leader in the "new history of the West" movement, builds upon Patricia N. Limerick's The Legacy of Conquest ( LJ 9/1/87) to provide a far-reaching explanation of the creation of a region rather than just the vanishing of the frontier. Drawing upon ethnic, environmental, urban, labor, and women's history as well as traditional sources, White gives fresh perspective to the West. His book is well written and contains useful graphics, though a major disappointment is the lack of footnotes. Nonetheless, this is a significant contribution to the understanding not only of how the West was won but also of how much of it was lost. This will appeal to history buffs and scholars and is highly recommended for academic and larger public libraries.<br><i>-Daniel Liestman, Seattle Pacific Univ.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gospel of Luke</h2><p>Commentary by William Hendriksen and Simon J.

They chanted, a monotonous, rhythmic drone, over and over. It was endless, maddening.<br> He peered through the gray haze, trying to get his bearings. It was either dawn or dusk; he wasn't sure and it disturbed him that he didn't know. He could see that he was inside some sort of temple. It was circular and roofless with immense stone pillars arching toward the leaden sky.<br> He didn't belong here; he was out of place. His head protruded above everyone else's, and he was the only person who wasn't wearing a robe. He looked down at himself and saw that he wasn't wearing anything. Then he realized that he was standing on a flat rock and that was why he was taller than everyone else.<br> What was he doing here? How had he gotten here?<br> They were looking at&nbsp;him now. Every head was turned toward him. The droning grew louder; it pounded against him. Why were they moving toward him? Why wouldn't his feet move? Why did his body feel like lead?<br> One man stood in front of all the others. He pointed at him. "Jones,&nbsp;we know you're coming. Know you're coming."<br> That was it--the chant.<br> Now they were rushing at him, a sea of black, their robes flapping at their ankles. He looked around frantically for an escape route. His arms pumped at his sides, his feet blurred beneath him, but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere. They must have drugged him; but who were they?<br> His head snapped around. They were almost on top of him. Move. Move. Fast. Air exploded from his lungs. A grinning face leered at him. The sky tilted. The pillars were toppling toward him. And suddenly he was awake, his arms twitching, his feet jerking, a scream poised at the edge of his tongue.<br> He sucked in his breath and looked around. But he could still hear the incessant chanting. He blinked his eyes, orienting himself. The train. Of course. The cars rumbled over the rails, the sound of the chanting, and someone was pounding on the door of his compartment. He sat forward, and ran his hands across his perspiration-soaked brow.<br> "Who is it?"<br> The pounding stopped. The door opened and a slender, gray-haired Englishman wearing a conductor's uniform peered in at him. "Mr. Jones? Sorry if I disturbed you."<br> Indy rubbed his face. "That's all right. What is it?"<br> The conductor held up a package. "It was waiting for you at the last stop."<br> "You sure it's for me?" Indy took the flat, rectangular box. It was wrapped in white paper, with an envelope taped to it that said Indy Jones. "Probably only one of us aboard." He thanked the conductor, who smiled&nbsp;thinly, nodded, and retreated.<br> He turned the package over in his hand. It looked like a candy box. It rattled when he shook it. He held it to his nose; it smelled faintly of chocolate. Who would send chocolates? he wondered as he slipped a card out of the envelope. The message was typewritten: Have an enjoyable trip, and good luck on your new job. Henry Jones, Sr.<br> He blinked and reread it. Now how the hell did his father know he would be on this train? And since when did he wire him boxes of candy? They&nbsp;hadn't even spoken for more than two years, not since Indy had informed him of his switch in studies from linguistics to archaeology, a move his father had described as foolhardy and perfidious.<br> Then his frown vanished, and a smile curled on his lips. It&nbsp;was Shannon; it had to be. Jack Shannon knew all about his relationship with his father. The package was a goddamn joke, at least to someone with Shannon's jaded sense of humor. He shook his head, and set the card down on the box.<br> He stared out the window&nbsp;at the unbroken grayness of the countryside, and thought about his last night in Paris. A cloud of blue haze had hung in the air of the nightclub as the black woman on stage swayed and sang, her voice deep and sonorous, a perfect accompaniment to the soulful sounds of the cornet being played in the shadows behind her. As the last notes of the song had slowly faded away to the applause of the crowd, the tall, gangly cornet player with the goatee and unruly hair had walked off the stage. He shook hands, nodded, and smiled as he wove his way through the tables. Finally, he lowered himself into a chair at a table near the corner farthest from the stage.<br> "You're sounding real good, Jack. You and Louise," Indy said.<br> "Thanks. It's really come together in the last six months."<br> "I'll miss it."<br> Shannon studied his face. "I don't blame you for leaving. It's getting too hectic. The scene's changed." He leaned forward and lit a cigarette from the burning candle on the table. "Sometimes, I look around and there's hardly a Parisian in the Jungle anymore. All tourists. Every night a new crowd. The regulars never show up until the last set, anymore. If they show up at all."<br> Indy put on his fedora. "You know you're welcome to come and visit anytime you like."<br> "I may take&nbsp;you up on that. I'd like to see London again."<br> Indy shook off his daydream, and focused on his surroundings. The rural countryside had given way to sooty brick factories and spewing smokestacks; he would be at Victoria Station in another half hour. After&nbsp;leaving Paris earlier in the week, he'd spent a couple of days in Brittany, where he'd examined some of the megalithic ruins in the region. Then this morning he'd taken a ferry across the channel and boarded the train.<br> He ripped the paper from the package. French chocolates from Paris. "Nice going, Shannon."<br> He was about to remove the cover and sample a chocolate when the train suddenly braked for another station and a book slid off the seat. He leaned over and picked it&nbsp;up. The cover had flopped open to an epigraph on the first page of the eighteenth-century tome, which read: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.<br> "Fortunate is he who can know the inner meaning of things," he said.<br> He closed the cover. The book was called Choir Gaur, The Grand Orrery of the Ancient Druids, Commonly Called Stonehenge. He laughed to himself. He didn't have to look any further for the meaning of his dream. He'd been reading the book before he'd fallen asleep. Why black robes, though? he&nbsp;wondered. He was sure druids wore white. But who said dreams made sense?<br> The train started up again. He tapped his fingers on the package, then lifted the cover, and reached inside for a chocolate. It took a moment before he comprehended what he was seeing and feeling. Something black and hairy was crawling up his fingers, and it wasn't made of chocolate. He uttered a short cry, shook his hand, and gaped at the box. There were a few chocolates, but the rest of the compartments were filled with walnut-size&nbsp;spiders.<br> His knees jerked, kicking the box into the air. Chocolates and spiders spewed over him. He brushed them off and leaped to his feet. He stomped on spiders and squashed chocolates, sweeping his arms and legs and body clean of the crawling creatures, and trying not to think about how close he had come to taking a bite out of one of them.<br> Finally, he examined his seat and sat down again, but as he did felt one creeping inside his pants leg, and another on the inside of his collar. He nearly jumped out of his clothes. He shook his leg until the spider fell to the floor, and crushed it under his shoe. Then, carefully, he reached up to his collar and brushed at his neck.<br> He laughed nervously as a chocolate dropped to the floor. Relieved, he sat down, but immediately felt a tingling on his calf, and pulled up his pants leg. Dozens of tiny, newly hatched spiders wisped over his leg. "Aw . . . aw . . ." His teeth chattered; he shuddered.<br> He brushed them off, swatting them with a rolled-up newspaper. Then,&nbsp;he inspected his leg to make sure none was left.<br> He picked up the box and examined it. It hadn't been a matter of spiders invading the chocolate box. Someone had planted them.<br> "Shannon?" he said aloud. Would he go to all the trouble for a practical joke&nbsp;that he wouldn't even see carried out? Maybe, but this was no joke.<br> He looked at the card again. Maybe it was his father? No, couldn't be. He wouldn't. Besides, it was addressed to Indy Jones, and his father never called him that. But Shannon knew that. If this was his idea of playing a joke, why wouldn't he have addressed it to Henry Jones, Jr., as his father's letters had always read when they were college roommates back in Chicago?<br> He heard a tap on the door. "Yes?"<br> The conductor opened it. "I need to&nbsp;check your ticket, please."<br> Indy reached cautiously into his coat pocket, and handed his ticket to the conductor. "Mind if I switch compartments for the rest of the trip? This one has spiders."<br> "Spiders?" The conductor's eyes shifted about the compartment; his shoulders twitched. Indy understood perfectly. He pointed at a spider crawling along the window frame.<br> The conductor handed Indy his ticket, and backed out of the compartment. "Right this way, sir."<br> Indy&nbsp;quickly gathered up his books, and the conductor carried his luggage. At the last moment, he grabbed the empty box and wrapper, hoping they held some clue to the source of the so-called gift. When he was settled in his new seat, he asked the conductor how&nbsp;he might find out where the package he'd received had come from.<br> "That's easy. Just look at the number in the corner of the wrapper."<br> Indy flattened it out. "Twelve."<br> "That's it. They always put a number on the packages so the telegraph office can notify the sender that the package was delivered, if they request the service."<br> "So where's twelve?"<br> The conductor smiled. "That's easy. It was sent from London."<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Katie in London</h2><p>When Katie and her cousin Jack visit London with Grandma, they don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to see and do.

But if even a few excessively controlling grownups learn to "let children be children," this big, colorful picture book might serve its purpose after all. Patty, Mickey, and Liza Sue live in a big brown box (locked from the inside) with all the amenities a modern child dreams of: TV, Barbie, pizza, Spice Girls T-shirts, beanbag chairs, and Pepsi. All this, but no liberty. They've been placed in this box because the adults in their lives believe "those kids can't handle their freedom." They have too much fun in school, sing when they should be studying, feed honey to the bees, and play handball where they shouldn't. Parents, neighbors, and teachers are uncomfortable with these irrepressible children, and hope to control them with strict boundaries. Meanwhile, the younger-yet-wiser children just want the freedom to become themselves: "Even sparrows scream/ And rabbits hop/ And beavers chew trees when they need 'em./ I don't mean to be rude: I want to be nice,/ But I'd like to hang on to my freedom."<p> Giselle Potter's lovely, childlike paintings create an atmosphere of na�ve bewilderment, as the plaintive children wail, over and over, "If freedom is handled just <i>your</i> way/ Then it's not my freedom or free." Morrison's first foray into children's literature is a puzzling, thickly ironic book that asks more questions than it answers. Even as a celebration of the unfettered exuberance of children in the face of societal oppression, a lighter touch would have done wonders. (Click to see a sample spread.

With permission of Jump at the Sun, Hyperion Books for Children.) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Nobel laureate Morrison's debut book for children unfortunately shows little of the childlike perspective that so masterfully informs The Bluest Eye. This enigmatic tale, written in verse, is inspired by a story made up by Morrison's then nine-year-old son. The opening scene depicts two girls and a boy who live in a "big brown box" with a door that has "three big locks." The trio have been sent there by adults who think they "can't handle their freedom." Suburban Patty has "too much fun in school all day" ("When we pledged to the flag, she'd spoil it"); urban Mickey writes his name on mailbox lids and plays handball next to a sign that forbids the game; and country girl Liza Sue lets the chickens keep their eggs and feeds honey to the bees. Each child, when told that he or she has overstepped the bounds, counters with the identical unchildlike response: "I know you are smart and I know that you think/ You're doing what is best for me./ But if freedom is handled just your way/ Then it's not my freedom or free." The parents, never visible visiting the box, nonetheless leave behind plenty of parting gifts (e.g., "Blimpies and Frisbees... and Matchbox cars that go"). In the final scene, the children, inexplicably, easily clamber over the sides of the big brown box to freedom. Potter's (Gabriella's Song) handsome illustrations in a postmodern folk-art style possess an austere simplicity, effectively marking the contrast to the adults' commercial bribes littering the floor. But ultimately the tale is mundane; the social commentary on childhood, freedom and the tendency of parents to give children things instead of time and attention seems aimed more at adult readers than children.

Within a few brief years, Putin had dismantled the country&#39;s media, wrested control and wealth from the country&#39;s burgeoning business class, and decimated the fragile mechanisms of democracy. Virtually every obstacle to his unbridled control was removed and every opposing voice silenced, with political rivals and critics driven into exile or to the grave. Drawing on information and sources no other writer has tapped, Masha Gessen&#39;s fearless account charts Putin&#39;s rise from the boy who had scrapped his way through post-war Leningrad schoolyards, to the &#39;faceless&#39; man who manoeuvred his way into absolute - and absolutely corrupt - power.</p><p><b><b>Masha Gessen</b> </b>is a Russian American journalist and the author, most recently, of the national bestseller <i>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin </i>and <i>Words Will Break Cement: The Passion of Pussy Riot</i>. Her award-winning work has appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and elsewhere. A longtime resident of Moscow, Gessen now lives in New York.ON MAY 13, 2000, six days after he was inaugurated, Putin signed his first decree and proposed a set of bills, all of them aimed, as he stated, at &#x201c;strengthening vertical power.&#x201d; They served as the beginning of a profound restructuring of Russia&#x2019;s federal composition, or, put another way, as the beginning of the dismantling of the country&#x2019;s democratic structures. One of the bills replaced elected members of the upper house of the parliament with appointed ones: two from each of Russia&#x2019;s<br> eighty-nine regions, one appointed by the governor of the region and one by the legislature. Another bill allowed elected governors to be removed from office on mere suspicion of wrongdoing, without a<br> court decision. The decree established seven presidential envoys to seven large territories of the country, each comprising about a dozen regions, each of which had its elected legislature and governor. The envoys, appointed by the president, would supervise the work of<br> elected governors.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem Putin was trying to address with these measures was real. In 1998, when Russia defaulted on its foreign debt and plummeted into a profound economic crisis, Moscow had given the<br> regions wide latitude in managing their budgets, collecting taxes, setting tariffs, and creating economic policies. For this and other reasons, the Russian Federation had become as loose as a structure can be while remaining, at least nominally, a single state. Because the problem was real, Russia&#x2019;s liberal politicians&#x2014;who still believed Putin to be one of them&#x2014;did not criticize his solution to it, even though it clearly contradicted the spirit and possibly also the letter of the 1993 constitution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Putin appointed the seven envoys. Only two of them were civilians&#x2014;and one of these very much appeared to have the biography of an undercover KGB agent. Two were KGB officers from Leningrad, one was a police general, and two more were army generals who had commanded the troops in Chechnya. So Putin appointed generals to watch over popularly elected governors&#x2014;who could also now be removed by the federal government.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lone voice against these new laws belonged to Boris Berezovsky, or, rather, to my old acquaintance Alex Goldfarb, the �migr� former dissident who just a year earlier had been willing to be charmed by Putin. He authored a brilliant critique of the decree and the bills that was published under Berezovsky&#x2019;s byline in <i>Kommersant</i>, the popular daily newspaper Berezovsky owned. &#x201c;I assert that the most important outcome of the Yeltsin presidency has been the change in mentality of millions of people: those who used to be slaves fully dependent on the will of their boss or the state became free people who depend only on themselves,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;In a democratic society, laws exist to protect individual freedom. . . . The legislation you have proposed will place severe limitations on the independence and civil freedoms of tens of thousands of top-level Russian politicians, forcing<br> them to take their bearings from a single person and follow his will. But we have been through this!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> No one took notice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bills sailed through the parliament. The installation of the envoys drew no protest. What happened next was exactly what Berezovsky&#x2019;s letter had predicted, and it went far beyond the legal<br> measures introduced by Putin. Something shifted, instantly and perceptibly, as though the sounds of the new/old Soviet/Russian national anthem had signaled the dawn of a new era for everyone. Soviet instincts, it seemed, kicked in all over the country, and the Soviet Union was instantly restored in spirit.<br> &nbsp;<br> You could not quite measure the change. One brilliant Ph.D. student at Moscow University noticed that traditional ways of critiquing election practices, such as tallying up violations (these were on the increase&#x2014;things like open voting and group voting became routine) or trying to document falsifications (a nearly impossible task) fell short of measuring such a seemingly ephemeral thing<br> as culture. Darya Oreshkina introduced the term &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d;&#x2014; one in which elections, while formally free, are orchestrated by local authorities trying to curry favor with the federal center.<br> She identified their statistical symptoms, such as anomalously high voter turnouts and a strikingly high proportion of votes accrued by the leader of the race. She was able to show that over time, the<br> number of precincts where &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d; decided the outcome grew steadily, and grew fast. In other words, with every election at every level of government, Russians ceded to the authorities more of their power to decide. &#x201c;Geography disappeared,&#x201d; she said later&#x2014;meaning, the entire country was turning into an undifferentiated managed space.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN MARCH 2004, when Putin stood for reelection, he had five opponents. They had overcome extreme obstacles to join the race. A law that went into effect just before the campaigns launched required that a notary certify the presence and signature of every person present at a meeting at which a presidential candidate is nominated. Since the law required that a minimum of five hundred people attend such a meeting, the preliminaries took four to five hours; people had to arrive in the middle of the day to certify their presence so that the meeting could commence in the evening. After the meeting the potential candidate had a few weeks to collect two million signatures. The old law had required half as many signatures and allotted twice as much time to collect them; but more important, the new law specified the look of these signatures down to the comma. Hundreds<br> of thousands of signatures were thrown out by the Central Election Commission because of violations such as the use of &#x201c;St. Petersburg&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;Saint Petersburg&#x201d; or the failure to write out the words &#x201c;building&#x201d; or &#x201c;apartment&#x201d; in the address line.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of Putin&#x2019;s St. Petersburg city hall colleagues told me years later that during his tenure as Sobchak&#x2019;s deputy, Putin had received &#x201c;a powerful inoculation against the democratic process.&#x201d; He and Sobchak had ultimately fallen victim to the democratic menace in St. Petersburg, and now that Putin was running the country, he was restoring the late-Soviet mechanisms of control: he was building a tyranny of bureaucracy. The Soviet bureaucracy had been so unwieldy, incomprehensible, and forbidding that one could function within it only by engaging in corruption, using either money or personal favors as currency. That made the system infinitely pliant&#x2014;which is why &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d; functioned so well.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the voting itself, international observers and Russian nongovernmental organizations documented a slew of violations, including: the deletion from the rolls of over a million very elderly<br> people and other unlikely voters (when I went to cast my vote, I was able to see that my eighty-four-year-old grandmother&#x2019;s name was in fact missing from the list; my voting precinct was also, coincidentally, located next door to an office of the ruling United Russia party); the delivery of prefilled ballots to a psychiatric ward; precinct staff arriving at an elderly voter&#x2019;s home with a mobile ballot box and leaving hastily when they saw that she was planning to vote for someone other than Putin; and managers and school officials telling staff or students&#x2019; parents that contracts or financing depended on their vote. In all likelihood, none of these steps was dictated directly by the Kremlin; rather, following renewed Soviet instincts, individuals did what they could for their president.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the campaign, opposition candidates constantly encountered refusals to print their campaign material, air their commercials, or even rent them space for campaign events. Yana Dubeykovskaya,<br> who managed the campaign of nationalist-leftist economist Sergei Glazyev, told me that it took days to find a printing plant willing to accept Glazyev&#x2019;s money. When the candidate tried to hold a campaign event in Yekaterinburg, the largest city in the Urals, the police suddenly kicked everyone out of the building, claiming there was a bomb threat. In Nizhny Novgorod, Russia&#x2019;s third-largest city, electricity was turned off when Glazyev was getting ready to speak&#x2014;and every subsequent<br> campaign event in that city was held outdoors, since no one was willing to rent to the pariah candidate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Around election time, I interviewed a distant acquaintance, the thirty-one-year-old deputy director of news programming on All-Russia State Television. Eight years earlier, Yevgeniy Revenko had<br> become the youngest reporter working at a national television channel, Gusinsky&#x2019;s independent NTV. He had quickly become known as one of the more enterprising and dogged reporters. The way he worked now seemed to be very different. &#x201c;A country like Russia needs the sort of television that can effectively deliver the government&#x2019;s message,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;As the state grows stronger, it needs to convey its message directly, with no interpretations.&#x201d; He described his channel&#x2019;s editorial policy as a simple one: &#x201c;We do show negative stories&#x2014;we will report a disaster, if it occurs, for example&#x2014;but we do not go looking for them. Nor do we go looking for positive stories, but we do focus the viewers&#x2019; attention on them. We never speculate about the reasons for something&#x2014;say, an official&#x2019;s fi ring&#x2014;even if we happen to know the reason. All our information comes from official government statements. In any case, the logic is simple. We are a state television company. Our state is a presidential republic. That means we do not criticize the president.&#x201d; Very occasionally, admitted Revenko over a mug of beer at an Irish pub in the center of Moscow, he felt he had to stifle his creative urge. &#x201c;But I say to myself, &#x2018;This is where I work.&#x2019;&#x201d; He grew up in a military family and had some military training himself. That clearly helped.<br> &nbsp;<br> The late Soviet state had depended on using the many and punishing the few&#x2014;and the KGB had been in charge of the latter. This system had been more or less restored now. While the vast majority enthusiastically fell in line, those who did not paid the price. Marina Litvinovich, the young woman who had helped create Putin and had urged him to go talk to the families of the <i>Kursk </i>crew, was now managing the campaign of his lone liberal opponent in the race, former parliament member Irina Khakamada, who had herself supported Putin four years earlier. During the campaign, Litvinovich got a phone call telling her, &#x201c;We know where you live and where your child plays outside.&#x201d; She hired a bodyguard for her three-year-old. She was also robbed and beaten. Yana Dubeykovskaya, Glazyev&#x2019;s campaign manager, was also beaten and robbed, and once started driving her car before discovering that the brakes had been cut. A step down on the persecution ladder were apartment burglaries. In the months leading up to the election, opposition journalists and activists of Committee 2008&#x2014;a group organizing to bring about a more fair election in four<br> years&#x2014;had their apartments broken into. Often these burglaries occurred concurrently in different areas of Moscow. My own apartment was burglarized in February. The only things taken were a laptop computer, the hard drive from a desktop computer, and a cell phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> On election night, Khakamada planned a great defeat party. Her campaign rented a spacious Southwestern-themed restaurant and splurged on a spread of salmon, lobster, artichokes, and an open bar. Popular music groups lined up at the microphone, and the country&#x2019;s best-known rock journalist emceed. Nobody came. Waiters seemed to outnumber the guests, and the artichokes lingered. Still, the organizers continued to check all comers against a strict name list. Russian liberals were still struggling to come to terms with just how marginal they had become.<br> &nbsp;<br> Watching the guests, I was thinking it was understandable that it had taken a while. Four years after putting Putin in office, the few liberals who had switched to the opposition still had personal connections to the many former liberals who remained part of the Russian political establishment. In a vacant dining room off the main hall, Marina Litvinovich perched at one end of a long empty oak table next to Andrei Bystritsky, deputy chairman of the Russian state television and radio conglomerate. Bystritsky, a red-bearded bon vivant in his mid-forties, complained about the wine. &#x201c;The wine is no worse than our election results,&#x201d; Litvinovich shot back. Bystritsky immediately ordered a hundred-dollar bottle of wine for the table, and then another. It seemed he had come to assuage his guilt. He assured anyone who would listen that he had voted for Khakamada and had even told his two hair-and-makeup people to vote for her. Of course, he had also run the campaign coverage that went out to about forty-five million Russian homes, and told them, over and over again, to vote for Putin. Seventy-one percent of the voters did.<br> &nbsp;<br> I went to see Bystritsky in his office three days after the election. We had known each other a long time&#x2014;in the mid-1990s he had been my editor at <i>Itogi&#x2014;</i>so there was no point in pussyfooting around the main question.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So tell me,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;how do you conduct the propaganda of Putin&#x2019;s regime?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bystritsky shrugged uncomfortably and busied himself with hospitable preliminaries. He offered me tea, cookies, chocolates, chocolate-covered marshmallows, and finally a CD with the collected speeches, photographs, and video footage of President Putin. The slipcover had five photographs of the president: serious, intense, impassioned, formal smiling, and informal smiling. The serious one had been reproduced widely: on Election Day alone, I came across it on the cover of school notebooks, on preframed portraits for sale at the Moscow Central Post Offi ce (a bargain at $1.50 for a letter-size picture), and on pink, white, and blue balloons for sale in Red Square. The sale of any of these items on voting day was a violation of election law.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t especially do any propaganda,&#x201d; Bystritsky said, settling into a leather armchair. &#x201c;Look at the election, for example.&#x201d; Russian law left over from the nineties required media outlets to provide all candidates with equal access to viewers and readers. Bystritsky had his numbers ready, and it was funny math: the president, he claimed, had engaged in only one election activity&#x2014;meeting with his campaign activists&#x2014;and the twenty-nine-minute meeting was broadcast three times in its entirety during regular newscasts, which had to be extended to accommodate it. On every other day of the campaign, the state television channel also showed Putin during its newscasts&#x2014;usually as the lead story&#x2014;but these, Bystritsky explained, were not campaign activities but the stuff of the president&#x2019;s day job. An exhaustive study conducted by the Russian Union of Journalists, on the other hand, concluded that Putin got about seven times as much news coverage on the state channel as did<br> either Khakamada or the Communist Party candidate; other candidates fared even worse. Coverage by the other state channel, the one that...</p><h2>The Second Cadfael Omnibus</h2><p>This volume contains three of Brother Cadfael&#39;s Chronicles: ST PETER&#39;S FAIR.

This selection of his writings on religion, ethics, politics, women, suicide, books and many other themes is taken from Schopenhauer&#39;s last work, Parerga and Paralipomena, which he published in 1851. These pieces depict humanity as locked in a struggle beyond good and evil, and each individual absolutely free within a Godless world, in which art, morality and self-awareness are our only salvation. This innovative - and pessimistic - view has proved powerfully influential upon philosophy and art, directly affecting the work of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein and Wagner among others. Arthur Schopenhauer was born in Danzig in 1788 where his family, of Dutch origin, owned a respected trading house. Arthur was expected to inherit the business, but hated the work and in 1807, after his father&#39;s suicide and the sale of the business, he enrolled in the grammar school at Gotha. He went on to study medicine and science at Gottingen University and in 1810 began to study philosophy. In 1811 he transferred to Berlin to write his doctoral thesis, and began to write The World as Will and Idea, a complete exploration of his philosophy, which was finished in 1818. Although the book failed to sell, his belief in his own views sustained him through twenty-five years of frustrated desire for fame. During his middle life he travelled widely in Europe and in 1844 brought out a much expanded edition of his book, which after his death became one of the most widely read of all philosophical works. His fame was established in 1851 with the publication of Parerga and Paralipomena, a collection of dialogues, essays and aphorisms. He died in 1860. R.J. Hollingdale has translated works by, among others, Schopenhauer, Goethe, T.A. Hoffmann, Lichtenburg and Theodor Fontane, as well as eleven of Nietzsche&#39;s books, many for the Penguin Classics. He has published two books on Nietzsche and was Honorary President of the British Nietzsche Society until his death in 2003.</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer was born in Danzig in 1788 where his family, of Dutch origin, owned a respected trading house.

It is a book that chronicles many of the most exciting developments in genetics over the past decade by a man who is not only a brilliant scientist but also a gifted and thoroughly engaging writer. It ultimately demonstrates how much more we still have to discover about the absorbing story of human evolution.</strong></p> One of the most dramatic stories of genetic discovery since James Watson's <em>The Double Helix</em>&#x2015;a work whose scientific and cultural reverberations will be discussed for years to come. In 1994 Professor Bryan Sykes, a leading world authority on DNA and human evolution, was called in to examine the frozen remains of a man trapped in glacial ice in northern Italy. News of both the Ice Man's discovery and his age, which was put at over five thousand years, fascinated scientists and newspapers throughout the world. But what made Sykes's story particularly revelatory was his successful identification of a genetic descendant of the Ice Man, a woman living in Great Britain today. How was Sykes able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago? In <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em>, he gives us a firsthand account of his research into a remarkable gene, which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line. After plotting thousands of DNA sequences from all over the world, Sykes found that they clustered around a handful of distinct groups. Among Europeans and North American Caucasians, there are, in fact, only seven. This conclusion was staggering: almost everyone of native European descent, wherever they may live throughout the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the Seven Daughters of Eve. Naming them Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine, and Jasmine, Sykes has created portraits of their disparate worlds by mapping the migratory patterns followed by millions of their ancestors. In reading the stories of these seven women, we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, and how we are each living proof of the almost indestructible strands of DNA, which have survived over so many thousands of years. Indeed, <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em> is filled with dramatic stories: from Sykes's identification, using DNA samples from two living relatives, of the remains of Tsar Nicholas and Tsaress Alexandra, to the Caribbean woman whose family had been sold into slavery centuries before and whose ancestry Sykes was able to trace back to the Eastern coast of central Africa. Ultimately, Sykes's investigation reveals that, as a race, what humans have in common is more deeply embedded than what separates us.<br></p><p>Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, pioneered the use of DNA in exploring the human past. He is the author of Saxons, Vikings, and Celts and the&nbsp;New York Times bestseller The Seven Daughters of Eve."A traveler from an antique land... lives within us all," claims Sykes, a professor of genetics at Oxford. This unique traveler is mitochondrial DNA, and, as this provocative account illustrates, it can help scientists and archeologists piece together the history of the human race. Mitochondrial DNA is present in every cell in the body, and it remains virtually unchanged (aside from random mutations) as it passes from mother to daughter. By quantifying and analyzing the mutations of this relatively stable circle of DNA, Sykes has solved some of the hottest debates about human origins. For example, he clarified a long-running debate among anthropologists over the original inhabitants of the Cook Islands. After retrieving mitochondrial DNA samples from the island natives, Sykes concluded that the natives emigrated from Asia, not America, as many Western anthropologists had contended. In a similar manner, Sykes analyzed samples from native Europeans to determine that modern humans are not at all related to Neanderthals. The book's most complex and controversial find that the ancient European hunter-gatherers predominated over the farmers and not vice versa leads Sykes to another stunning conclusion: by chance, nearly all modern Europeans are descendants of one of seven "clan mothers" who lived at different times during the Ice Age. Drawing upon archeological and climatic records, Sykes spins seven informative and gracefully imagined tales of how these "daughters of Eve" eked out a living on the frozen plains. (July 9)Forecast: Sykes is a bit of a celebrity geneticist, as he was involved in identifying the remains of the last Romanovs. This fame, plus his startling conclusions augmented by a five-city tour should generate publicity and sales among science, archeology and genealogy buffs.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Slough House: Slough House Thriller 7</h2><p>The seventh book in the multi-award winning Jackson Lamb series</p><p>The latest instalment in the multi-award winning Jackson Lamb series<p>Mick Herron's first Jackson Lamb novel, <i>Slow Horses</i>, was shortlisted for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger and picked as one of the best twenty spy novels of all time by the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.

Across the Wide Missouri tells the compelling story of the climax and decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade during the 1830s. More than a history, it portrays the mountain fur trade as a way of business and a way of life, vividly illustrating how it shaped the expansion of the American West.</p><p>Like many U.S. historians, cultural critic Bernard DeVoto believed that the American character was rooted in the experience of westward expansion. Unlike those who championed the civilizing graces of the agrarian frontier, however, DeVoto drew inspiration from the mercenary, imperial designs of the fur trade. Originally published in 1947, <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>is arguably the best known of his studies in American history, examining the rise and fall of the U.S. fur dynasties in the 1830s. The book chronicles the competition between John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, an "opposition" group of trappers (including Jim Bridger and Kit Carson) descended from the earlier entrepreneurial activities of General William H. Ashley. Devoto specifically narrates the major expeditions and the daily experiences of the Western divisions of these companies, which scoured the northernmost regions of the Rocky Mountains for beaver. He contends that, by exploring the recently charted Northern plateau, fighting off interlopers, and setting up trade networks, the loose confederation of trappers, traders, and Native Americans shaped the materialism that typifies modern American society. In his densely detailed description of the company "rendezvous," DeVoto shows how the activities of trading, partying, and resource pooling created a shared experience for competing cultural and economic parties on the frontier. While the centrality of the fur trade in the development of the American character may strike some readers as overemphasized, DeVoto's thesis still carries much relevance for modern American studies. <i>--John M.

Desperate to get in the air, he makes it through basic training to become the youngest Spitfire pilot in the prestigious 92 Squadron. Thrust into combat almost immediately, Wellum finds himself flying several sorties a day, caught up in terrifying dogfights with German Me 109s. Over the coming months he and his fellow pilots play a crucial role in the Battle of Britain. But of the friends that take to the air alongside Wellum many never return.</p><p>"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."<br> &#x2013;Winston Churchill, 1940 <p>Geoffrey Wellum was one of Churchill&#x2019;s "few," the gallant pilots of the RAF who streaked through the skies to repel the massive, brutal Nazi bombing assaults that killed thousands and leveled entire cities throughout the endless months of the Battle of Britain. To a man, they were courageous, determined, and oh, so young. Geoffrey, known as Boy to his comrades, was a good deal younger than most.</p> <p>In First Light, Geoffrey Wellum tells the inspiring, often terrifying true story of his coming of age amid the roaring, tumbling dogfights of the fiercest air war the world had ever seen. It is the story of an idealistic schoolboy who couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck when the RAF agreed to take him on as a "pupil pilot" at the minimum age of seventeen and a half in 1939. In his fervor to fly, he gave little thought to the coming war.</p> <p>Writing with wit, compassion, and a great deal of technical expertise, Wellum relives his grueling months of flight training, during which two of his classmates crashed and died. He describes a hilarious scene during his first day in the prestigious 92nd Squadron when his commander discovered that Wellum had not only never flown a Spitfire, he&#x2019;d never even seen one.</p> <p>Boy soon learned the golden rule of the dogfight: "Never fly straight and level for more than twenty seconds. If you do, you&#x2019;ll die." Wellum&#x2019;s vivid accounts of ferocious aerial combat contrast the mortal terror of an innocent teenager with the grim determination of a highly trained warrior intent on doing his job&#x2013;blasting the enemy one moment, desperately trying to shake off a pursuer the next. Few writers have succeeded more completely in evoking the chaos and horror of war.</p> <p>A battle-hardened ace by the winter of 1941, though still not out of his teens, Boy flew scores of missions as fighter escort on bombing missions over France. Yet the constant life-or-death stress of murderous combat and anguish over the loss of his closest friends sapped endurance. Tortured by fierce headaches, even in the midst of battle, he could not bear the thought of "not pulling your weight," of letting other pilots risk their lives in his place. Wellum&#x2019;s frank account of his long, losing bout with battle fatigue is both moving and enlightening.</p> <p>Filled with affectionate portraits of Boy&#x2019;s fellow fliers&#x2013;many of whom did not survive the war&#x2013;First Light tells an unforgettable true story of patriotism and fear, pride and humility, self-sacrifice and triumph. Already a bestseller in England, this powerful and compelling memoir is destined to become a classic, not only of military history, but also of literature.</p>"Wellum's First Light deserves to be read for many years to come."<br> -The Times (of London) <p>High praise for England's bestselling First Light . . . </p><p>"An extraordinarily gripping and powerful story."<br> -The Evening Standard (London) </p><p>"A work of exceptional quality . . . a passion and immediacy which make it compelling reading."<br> -Max Hastings, author of Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy </p><p>"A remarkable book, amazingly fresh, honest, and modest . . . utterly gripping; it is without question one of the best books I have read in the last few years."<br> -Professor Richard Holmes, author of Redcoat: The British Soldier in the Age of Horse and Musket </p><p>"Startlingly vivid recollections . . .this is air war at its most intense . . . his readers get a strong sense of immediacy."<br> -The Spectator (London) </p><p>"Geoffrey Wellum's book is a wonderfully evocative find . . . a book for all ages and generations, a treasure."<br> -Daily Express (London)</p></p><h2>Opening Your Heart: The Starting Point from Walking with Purpose</h2><p>Opening Your Heart: The Starting Point is the introductory course and has been designed for women who are brand new to Walking with Purpose as well as those with more experience in Bible study.

Every month Kimray emphasized one of 49 character qualities, using character bulletins to provide practical definitions. Supervisors publicly recognized employees for good character during monthly meetings, and Kimray provided ongoing training for managers on how to model and encourage good character. </p><p> Other companies saw the results at Kimray and requested information, and Kimray established the Character Training Institute to continue developing Character First! materials and seminars. </p><p> In 1996, police and school officials from Oklahoma City invited the Character Training Institute to develop a character-building curriculum for elementary schools. In 1998, Mayor Tom Ed McHugh of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, led community leaders in an initiative to turn Baton Rouge into "A City of CharacterA City that Cares," and the Character Training Institute formed the International Association of Character Cities (IACC) to support other government and community representatives in their efforts. </p><p> In 1999, the Character Training Institute became a non-profit 501(c)3 corporation, and it continues to develop new resources for families, teachers, business managers, correctional facilities, and government agencies.

Well, we've got something even better: Memoria Press' new <i>Classical Composition</i> program, written by James Selby, doesn't just incorporate the classical approach, it is the classical approach. Going back to the method of writing instruction used for over 2,000 years, <i>Classical Composition</i> teaches the student 14 composition skills, called the progymnasmata, a set of elementary rhetorical exercises that formed the basis of persuasive writing. This approach was used to teach writing by Quintilian and Cicero, and produced writers such as Milton, Shakespeare, and Benjamin Franklin. <br>In the Fable Stage, students learn to master the ability of variation and paraphrasing, implementing the classical tenet of imitation. The texts they use as models are taken from the fable writer, Aesop.

His subjects include Andrew Ivy, who advocated the discredited anticancer drug Krebiozen; anticancer herbalist Harry Hoxsey; anticancer blood researcher Gaston Naessens; and antineoplastin researcher Stanislaw Burzynski. Those persecuted medical investigators are fairly well known, but some of Haley&#39;s other cases concern forgotten men like William Koch, developer of the antipolio drug Glyoxylide, whom many may find more interesting because of their obscurity. The stories of all 12 are often absent from current medical histories, which alone makes this book worthwhile. Haley&#39;s thesis that many of his subjects were victims of organized medicine, however, remains unproven. Moreover, his assertion that at least five of the 12 should have been Nobel laureates strains credibility, and the implication that the AMA controls the decisions of the Nobel committees seems dubious. --William Beatty, American Library Association.</p><p></p><h2>Wonder Art Workshop: Creative Child-Led Experiences for Nurturing Imagination, Curiosity, and a Love of Learning</h2><p><b>In <i>Wonder Art Workshop</i>, educator and educational development expert Sally Haughey shares her approach to hands-on, play-based learning with parents, teachers, and other facilitators, offering 25 activities that let your child take the lead in developing their own sense of intrinsic motivation to imagine, experiment, and discover.</b><br><br> The author's wonder-based approach reflects and synthesizes several child-centered educational movements, including Reggio Emilia, Waldorf, and Montessori.&nbsp;<br><br> Become a catalyst for cultivating your child&#x2019;s curious mind through these steps and activities, which start with art and apply to other subjects, including science and literacy:<ul><li><b>Take stock for your wonder journey </b>with helpful guidance on collecting materials, preparing a space, and nurturing the process while allowing children to make independent choices.</li><li><b>Harness curiosity </b>through a collection of sensory-based activities that use a variety of loose parts and other creative materials for open-ended play.</li><li><b>Encourage experimentation </b>by unleashing your child&#x2019;s inner alchemist with &#x201c;potion trays&#x201d; they can use to mix color, create fizzing concoctions, make play dough, and more.</li><li><b>Unlock literacy play </b>with activities that inspire children to imagine and create their own characters, structures, and landscapes.</li></ul>Give your children the precious gifts of wonder and curiosity and help them become the best they can be with <i>Wonder Art Workshop.</i></p><p><p><b>Sally Haughey</b> is the founder and CEO of Fairy Dust Teaching (fairydustteaching.com), a company committed to the growth and empowerment of teachers through professional development with a focus on child-centered education.

Learn how to repurpose your wisdom.</b><br><br>At age 52, after selling the company he founded and ran as CEO for 24 years, rebel boutique hotelier Chip Conley was looking at an open horizon in midlife. Then he received a call from the young founders of Airbnb, asking him to help grow their disruptive start-up into a global hospitality giant. He had the industry experience, but Conley was lacking in the digital fluency of his 20-something colleagues. He didn't write code, or have an Uber or Lyft app on his phone, was twice the age of the average Airbnb employee, and would be reporting to a CEO young enough to be his son. Conley quickly discovered that while he'd been hired as a teacher and mentor, he was also in many ways a student and intern. What emerged is the secret to thriving as a mid-life worker: learning to marry wisdom and experience with curiosity, a beginner's mind, and a willingness to evolve, all hallmarks of the "Modern Elder."<br><br>In a world that venerates the new, bright, and shiny, many of us are left feeling invisible, undervalued, and threatened by the "digital natives" nipping at our heels. But Conley argues that experience is on the brink of a comeback. Because at a time when power is shifting younger, companies are finally waking up to the value of the humility, emotional intelligence, and wisdom that come with age. And while digital skills might have only the shelf life of the latest fad or gadget, the human skills that mid-career workers possess--like good judgment, specialized knowledge, and the ability to collaborate and coach - never expire.<br><br>Part manifesto and part playbook, Wisdom@Work ignites an urgent conversation about ageism in the workplace, calling on us to treat age as we would other type of diversity. In the process, Conley liberates the term "elder" from the stigma of "elderly," and inspires us to embrace wisdom as a path to growing whole, not old. Whether you've been forced to make a mid-career change, are choosing to work past retirement age, or are struggling to keep up with the millennials rising up the ranks, Wisdom@Work will help you write your next chapter.</p><p>Bestselling author and hospitality entrepreneur Chip Conley is Strategic Advisor at Airbnb.

My friend Bert, whom I often ran into at entrepreneurial speaking gigs, cofounded the clothing lifestyle company Life is Good. We were two of the older speakers at the idealistic, entrepreneurial global tribe event called Summit. At fifty-�five, I was probably two dozen years older than the average attendee, and Bert was just four years behind me. After more than three years in the trenches with the millennial founders of Airbnb, helping them guide their rocket ship, this was my first &#x201c;coming out&#x201d; speech about what it means to be a &#x201c;Modern Elder&#x201d; in today&#x2019;s youth-�obsessed world.<br><br>Bert&#x2019;s blunt question&#x2014;�part offended, part perplexed&#x2014;�serves as a litmus test for our grand ambivalence with age. At a time when Botox is becoming as popular in Silicon Valley as it is in Hollywood, why was I willingly prancing onstage calling attention to myself as the oldster in the crowd? And I got the sense that beneath the surface of Bert&#x2019;s semirhetorical question lurked another, more pressing one: What the hell is going on with our relationship with age?<br><br>Just before my fiftieth birthday, I sold my baby. Not exactly. But that&#x2019;s sort of what it felt like to part ways with the boutique hotel company that I founded and ran for two dozen years. The Great Recession had taken its toll on my financial and emotional well-�being, and it was clear I was ready for a change. In my early fifties and nowhere near ready to retire, I found myself temporarily adrift. That is, until Brian Chesky, the young CEO of Airbnb, came calling and thus began my odyssey into a new world, which reacquainted me with the wisdom I&#x2019;d accumulated in my years on this planet. But it also reminded me how raw and curious I could be as well.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll tell you more about that story later, along with stories of many inspiring people who are not only surviving, but thriving, in the later years of their working life. Like a schoolteacher who reinvented herself as an entrepreneur and started a booming travel agency in her late forties. Or a software engineer in his early fifties who went from writing computer code to counseling colleagues as he became a Silicon Valley leadership coach. Or a former Merrill Lynch exec who found inspiration for the memoir he was struggling to write at age seventy by becoming a summer intern surrounded by college students at a pharmaceutical giant.<br><br>You don&#x2019;t have to be on the other side of fifty to find this book relevant. The age at which we&#x2019;re feeling self-�consciously &#x201c;old&#x201d; is creeping into some people&#x2019;s thirties, with power cascading to the young in so many companies. At a time when &#x201c;software is eating the world,&#x201d; tech is disrupting not just taxis and hotels, but virtually all industries, the result being that more and more companies are relentlessly pursuing young hires and putting high DQ (digital intelligence) above all other skills. The problem is that many of these young digital leaders are being thrust into positions of power&#x2014;�often running companies or departments that are scaling quickly&#x2014;�with little experience or guidance.<br><br>Yet, at exactly the same time, there exists a generation of older workers with invaluable skills&#x2014;�high EQ (emotional intelligence), good judgment born out of decades of experience, specialized knowledge, and a vast network of contacts&#x2014;�who could pair with these ambitious millennials to create businesses that are built to endure. Ironically, the more technology becomes ubiquitous, the less DQ is actually a differentiator. While coding skills may become commoditized, the one thing that can never be automated or left to artificial intelligence is the human element of business. You may not be a software developer, but you are a soft skills developer&#x2014;�and soft skills are the ones that will matter most in the organization of the future.<br><br>Whether this is the second, third, or fourth act of your working life, the principles and practices in this book will show you how to leverage your skills and experience to stay not just relevant, but indispensable in the modern workplace. The world needs your wisdom now more than ever.<br><br>WHAT&#x2019;S YOUR VINTAGE?<br><br>Yesterday I woke up with a fifty-�seven-�year-�old man in my bed and, more painfully, he showed up looking back at me in my bathroom mirror (� la Gloria Steinem). I may feel seventeen, but catching a glimpse of my badly lit fifty-�seven-�year-�old image, whether in the mirror or in some friend&#x2019;s photo on Facebook, is awful-�tasting truth serum. Yet, oddly, my fifties have been my favorite decade. I&#x2019;m enjoying the &#x201c;Indian summer&#x201d; of my life: young enough to take up surfing, old enough to know what&#x2019;s important in life.<br><br>Dr. Laura Carstensen, founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, has shown that people prioritize the present when time horizons are constrained. Accordingly, she&#x2019;s surprisingly found that people in their seventies are often happier and more content with life than those in their fifties, forties, or even thirties. By midlife, we may have slayed some of our internal dragons and healed many of our youthful wounds. All kinds of happiness surveys demonstrate a U-�curve of adult satisfaction with younger adults starting out pretty excited by life. Then happiness starts to dip in one&#x2019;s late twenties and thirties when the mash-�up of responsibilities associated with friends, family, infants, finances, and finding time for oneself, takes its toll. It can hit its low point in our forties when midlife disappointment may lead, for some, to new sports cars and wrecked marriages.<br><br>And, then, you&#x2019;re in your fifties and miraculously, the grand reset of expectations you experienced during the prior decade, a reprioritization of what&#x2019;s important, leads you to feeling a little better about life. You&#x2019;re finally getting to enjoy all the confidence, courage, and crazy sense of humor you&#x2019;ve accumulated along the way. An inner calm has started to emerge after decades of frenzied juggling. You feel an increasing capacity to be true to yourself. So it&#x2019;s great to be this age! But, just as this U-�curve points us back in the right direction, we&#x2019;re faced with a tiny voice in our heads (echoing financier Bernard Baruch) saying, &#x201c;Old age is always fifteen years older than I am.&#x201d; Hence, Bert&#x2019;s reaction. We&#x2019;ve never been so young and so old.<br><br>We can distract ourselves from the mirror and &#x201c;untag&#x201d; ourselves in Facebook photos, but society has an uncanny way of reminding us of our age. A growing number of people fear being increasingly invisible. Others feel like an old carton of milk, with an expiration date mistakenly stamped on their wrinkled foreheads. One paradox of our time is that baby boomers enjoy better health than ever, remain vibrant and stay in the workplace longer, but feel less and less relevant. They worry, justifiably, that bosses or potential employers may see their experience (and the clocked years that come with it) as more of a liability than an asset. Especially in the tech industry, where I somewhat accidentally found myself launching a second act in my own career.<br><br>But we workers &#x201c;of a certain age&#x201d; are in fact less like a carton of spoiled milk and more like a bottle of fine wine of an especially valuable vintage. Especially in the digital era. And especially in the tech sector, which has become as famous for youth as for innovation, and as notorious for toxic company cultures and human resource headaches as for reckless twentysomething CEOs&#x2014;�and where companies and investors are finally waking up and realizing they could use a little of the humility, emotional intelligence, and wisdom that comes with age. In this book, I will argue that those of us with a little aging patina do have something to offer. Especially now.<br><br>We may live ten years longer than our parents and may even work twenty years longer, yet power is moving to those ten years younger. That can lead to a decades-�long &#x201c;irrelevancy gap&#x201d; for those in my age range if we don&#x2019;t rethink our role. To avoid the fate of &#x201c;boomer angst,&#x201d; we&#x2019;d be wise to learn how to store the wine so it doesn&#x2019;t go bad. What makes a wine good is not only its age, but also the way you store it, the way you serve it, and the reason for raising a glass.<br><br>ARE OLDER PEOPLE NEEDED IN THE DIGITAL ERA?<br><br>Recently, my iPhone went haywire. It lost an hour, so for a couple days my phone was an hour younger than the time on my MacBook Air. This technical snafu didn&#x2019;t just affect me&#x2014;�thousands of iPhone users were missing flights and appointments as a result of this software glitch. I chalked this up to further evidence that the digital gods at Apple, with a median employee age of thirty-�one, are orchestrating our lives in more and more ways. I searched for an answer in the place I always go, Google (median employee age of thirty), to see how I could hack a solution and age my phone by an hour, but turning the damn thing on and off didn&#x2019;t solve things. So I retreated to another familiar spot, Facebook (median employee age of twenty-�eight), to ask for help from my posse.<br><br>While the median age of employees in the United States is forty-�two, that number is more than a decade younger among our tech titans. And a Harvard Business Review study showed that the average age of founders of unicorns (young, private companies with more than $1 billion in valuation) is thirty-�one, and the average age of their CEOs is forty-�one, as compared to the average age of an S&amp;P 500 company CEO, which is fifty-�two. So power in business hasn&#x2019;t just lost an hour, it&#x2019;s lost a decade or two. Sixty may be the new forty physically, but when it comes to power, thirty is the new fifty!<br><br>In many cultures, passing wisdom was once a prized tribal tradition, but today many of us fear it might be as popular as passing gas. In a pre-�Gutenberg world, elders were keepers of their culture and agents of its survival and communication through myths, stories, and songs passed from one generation to the next. In an economy that was slow to change, the practical experience and institutional knowledge of the old remained continuously relevant to the young.<br><br>The acceleration of innovation made the elder less relevant. Literacy meant society was no longer solely dependent upon the memory and oral traditions of elders to share wisdom. Moving from an agricultural to an industrial economy meant age-�old traditions of farming were replaced by the technological efficiencies of the machine age. Plus, young people started moving away from their parents to the city, and in the second half of the nineteenth century, a flood of young Europeans immigrated to the United States, forging a life on their own without the wisdom of their parents to guide their path.<br><br>The brisk march of progress from the industrial to the tech era has created a strong bias toward digital natives who understand gadgets and gigabytes better than those of us who didn&#x2019;t grow up &#x201c;byting&#x201d; from the Apple in childhood. And there&#x2019;s a growing anxiety in the boardroom about keeping up, as change in the digital world is happening so fast that most companies report that their DQ is actually declining. CEOs are kept awake at night by the worry that their competitors are younger and digitally smarter. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the grass is greener on the other side as the percentage of companies that feel they are doing a great job of harnessing and profiting from technology dropped from 67 percent to 52 percent between 2016 and 2017, creating even more of a frenzy to hire young talent favoring the generation that seemed to have emerged from the womb with an iPad in hand and a Snapchat account.<br><br>And yet, so many of us feel like we&#x2019;re growing whole rather than growing old. Is there a way for us to be integrated into cultivating young brains like farmer elders of the past were able to cultivate young grains? What if there was a new, modern archetype of elderhood, one that was worn as a badge of honor, not cloaked in shame? What if we could tap into our know-�how and know-�who to be an asset in the workplace rather than a liability? With more generations in the workplace than ever before, elders have so much to offer those younger than them, including introductions to those who can cultivate and harvest their skills.<br><br>Maybe eldership offers a higher form of leadership. Gray heads are generally wiser than green ones. What if Modern Elders were the secret ingredient for the visionary businesses of tomorrow?<br><br>MODERN AGE WISDOM<br><br>Not every aged wine is a spectacular vintage. Similarly, just because you&#x2019;re older, it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean you&#x2019;re wiser. Paul Baltes and Ursula Staudinger of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development did a comprehensive study and found the average correlation between age and wisdom is roughly zero from ages twenty-�five to seventy-�five. While this may be disappointing on the surface, the researchers did find that many people cultivate something even more valuable: a skill for gathering wisdom as they age.<br><br>Dr. Darrell Worthy, who led a group of University of Texas psychologists in a series of experiments on wisdom, found older people were far better at making choices that led to long-�term gains. Younger adults made faster choices that led to more immediate rewards, while older adults were more adept at making strategic choices that took the future into account. Gandhi once wrote, &#x201c;There is more to life than simply increasing its speed.&#x201d; Maybe the Modern Elder can be the designated driver in a world where the accelerator pedal is pushed to its limit.<br><br>Professor Robert Sutton suggests that the hallmark of wisdom is an alchemy of confidence and doubt, and knowing when to up the ante of one versus the other. Scholar Copthorne Macdonald has listed forty-�eight characteristics of wisdom that can help create a framework for making the best choices. Wise people tend to acknowledge their fallibility, are reflective and empathetic, and have sound judgment, but these characteristics alone don&#x2019;t define wisdom.<br><br>If there&#x2019;s one quality I believe defines wisdom in the workplace more than any other, it is the capacity for holistic or systems thinking that allows one to get the &#x201c;gist&#x201d; of something by synthesizing a wide variety of information quickly. Part of this is aided by the skill of pattern recognition that helps you come to hunches faster that account for the bigger picture. And this is where age gives us the indisputable upper hand: the longer you&#x2019;ve been on this planet, the more patterns you&#x2019;ve seen and can recognize.<br><br>And this capacity for seeing the big picture can foster novel thinking. In his book, The Mature Mind: The Positive Power of the Aging Brain, psychiatrist Gene D. Cohen explains that older people, with the advantage of years of experience, have a vast storehouse of solutions embedded in their maturing brains that allows them to synthesize more information and poten...</p><h2>Torment (Fallen, Book 2)</h2><p><b>The second novel in the addictive and <b>worldwide bestselling&nbsp;</b>FALLEN series . . . where love never dies.</b><br><b><br>#1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller&nbsp;</b><br><b>A&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>&nbsp;Bestseller</b><br><b>More than 3 million series copies in print!</b><br><br>Hell on earth.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s like for Luce to be apart from her fallen angel boyfriend, Daniel.&nbsp;It took them an eternity to find one another, but now he has told her he must go away. Just long enough to hunt down the Outcasts&#x2014;immortals who want to kill Luce. Daniel hides Luce at Shoreline, a school on the rocky California coast with unusually gifted students: Nephilim, the offspring of fallen angels and humans.<br><br>At Shoreline, Luce learns what the Shadows are, and how she can use them as windows to her previous lives. Yet the more Luce learns, the more she suspects that Daniel hasn&#x2019;t told her everything. He&#x2019;s hiding something&#x2014;something dangerous.&nbsp;What if Daniel&#x2019;s version of the past isn&#x2019;t actually true? What if Luce is really meant to be with someone else?<br><b>&#x201c;Sexy and fascinating and scary . . . I loved loved loved it!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;P. C. Cast,&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author on&nbsp;<i>Fallen</i></b></p><p><strong>Amazon.com Exclusive: Questions for Lauren Kate</strong> <p> </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Luce and Daniel's story is very romantic. What inspired you to write a love story between a human and an angel? <br> <b>Lauren Kate:</b> I&#x2019;ve been writing love stories for as long as I&#x2019;ve been writing. To me, the most complicated romances make the most interesting narratives, so I&#x2019;m always looking for new obstacles to throw in my lovers&#x2019; paths. When I was getting my masters degree in fiction, I was studying biblical narratives and came across a line in Genesis (6:1-4), which describes a group of angels who fell in love with mortal women. Putting this reference together with a mention in Isaiah and another in Palsm 82, biblical scholars conclude that these angels were actually cast out of Heaven for their lust. Which means--you could say--that these angels chose love over Heaven. I found this to be an endlessly interesting set up for an incredibly complicated romance. I started thinking about what kind of mortal girl it would take to attract an angel&#x2019;s attention. And what it would be like for her to find herself in this position. What kind of baggage would an angel have? What would her very over-protective parents think? From there, this whole world unfurled in my head with fallen angels, demons, reincarnation, and the war between good and evil all battling for a piece of the action.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> We've been wondering about the "mechanics" of Luce and Daniel's story (for lack of a better word). Does Daniel age? Or does he stay seventeen forever (while Luce grows older)? And with that said, what does he do while Luce is growing up in each of her lives? What was he doing before he met Luce in this life?<br> <b>Kate:</b> What&#x2019;s important about angels is not their bodies but their souls. In their purest forms, they&#x2019;re actually genderless, but for my story to work--for the angels to come down to earth and interact with mortals--they all assume human bodies and attach themselves to human genders. Daniel is eternal and will live on forever, but the body Luce sees him in (gorgeous as it is) is really just a shell for the soul that she loves. There&#x2019;s not the feeling of a ticking clock in the background as there might be with, say, a vampire story. Right now I&#x2019;m writing <em>Passion</em>, the prequel where we&#x2019;ll see Luce and Daniel in a dozen other lifetimes, so I&#x2019;m exploring a lot of these mechanics (a great word for it, by the way) between the angel&#x2019;s bodies and souls.<br><br> The way Daniel occupies himself in between Luces varies from life to life. His soul is least at rest just after she&#x2019;s died, before she&#x2019;s incarnated into another life--when she is &#x201c;in between.&#x201d; During her lives, even when he isn&#x2019;t with her, he is always aware of her age, what she&#x2019;s going through, how she&#x2019;s doing. He has a sort of internal Lucinda clock. Sometimes he meets her as a child, sometimes he tries to stay away from her as long as possible, to give her as much of a life outside of him as he can. In the years leading up to the life where they meet at Sword and Cross, Daniel was living on Skid Row in Los Angeles. </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> <em>Fallen</em> and <em>Torment</em> talk a lot about the history of Heaven and Hell, the different classes of Angels, and the rules of human-angel interaction. Obviously these themes are explored heavily in religious texts, but were there other sources that informed your story? <br> <b>Kate:</b>It&#x2019;s interesting because there is actually very little in the Bible about angels--a few mentions in the Old Testament, a few more in the new. And the mentions that we do have are often vague or contradictory. Most of what we think of when we think of angels today comes from secular or cultural contexts. Seventy-five percent of it might have come from Milton alone. I worked with a biblical scholar at UC Davis who pointed me toward some apocryphal texts (books written during the same as the bible, but which were not included in the book when the canon was closed). Books like Enoch 1-3 and the Dead Sea Scrolls are chock full of angel references. I also read a trilogy on Satan and a book called the <em>A History of Heaven</em> both by Jeffrey Burton Russell, as well as a great book by Harold Bloom called <em>Omens of the Millennium</em>.<br><br> I got so engrossed in all of the research I did for <em>Fallen</em> that I had a hard time knowing when to stop reading and when to start writing. I had to realize that it was okay for me to pick and choose things from various accounts, to look past contradictions, and to come up with my own angel mythology. That&#x2019;s what Milton did, after all!</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> What is Cam's deal? We're not convinced that he's totally evil--in <em>Fallen</em>, he seemed to be trying to protect Luce by keeping her away from Daniel, and in <em>Torment</em> he and Daniel reach a mysterious truce, again to protect Luce. Will we be seeing more of him in book 3?<br> <b>Kate:</b>Speaking of Milton, isn&#x2019;t it fascinating that Satan is the most interesting character in <em>Paradise Lost</em>? From the start of this series, I have wanted to test the boundaries between what is &#x201c;good&#x201d; and what is &#x201c;evil.&#x201d; How and when do those terms get applied? Are they black and white or is there some flexibility along the spectrum? Obviously it&#x2019;s much more interesting if Heaven and Hell/good and evil work as binaries: opposites that orbit each other and are pulled toward each other with a mutual gravitation. We see that at the end of <em>Fallen</em> and in <em>Torment</em> with Daniel and Cam&#x2019;s truce. The idea that good and evil rely on each other is as old as the oldest dualistic religion, Zoroastrianism (on whose shoulders both Judaism and Christianity stood). <br><br> So yes, there is more to Cam than pure evil! (Especially since his character--the charming side of his character anyway--was based loosely on my husband.) We&#x2019;ll see a lot of him in <em>Passion</em> and will even begin to understand how he got where he is today. </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Can you tell us a little bit about book 3? Will we find out more about Luce and Daniel's past lives?<br> <b>Kate:</b><em>Passion</em> is going to be the craziest, coolest book I&#x2019;ve ever written! I&#x2019;m halfway through the first draft right now and it is so rewarding to finally get to delve into Luce and Daniel&#x2019;s past lives together. The history these two share is the stuff of epics, and I am learning so many new things about them as I write. For any reader out there feeling tortured by the teasing hints of so many thrilling past lives: <em>Passion</em> is your book! Everything--well, almost everything--will be illuminated. </p><p>LAUREN KATE is the internationally bestselling author of the FALLEN series:&nbsp;<i>Fallen, Torment, Passion, Rapture</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fallen in Love</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Unforgiven</i>.

That's right; you might as well jump right in. Choose a deck that has storytelling images on all the cards, and shuffle it thoroughly as you ask, "What do I most need to look at in my life right now?" <br> <br>Draw three cards and turn them to their faceup and upright positions (see Glossary). Which card is most intriguing? Which one is most unsettling? Which card has the most detail? Which card has the least detail? Decide which one of the three will be your "chosen card." It should have enough symbolism for you to explore in depth and, perhaps, be more interesting than pleasing. Aces are not your best bet or the Eight of Wands, as they usually have few details. It helps if one or more people are actively doing something in the image. If in doubt, pick a Major Arcana card. <br> <br>You'll be working with your chosen card throughout the book. Do not look up its meaning until you get to Step 10. If you feel truly drawn to do so, you can change your card at any time, but remember: the greater the challenge, the greater the potential growth. If you change your card, go back through the previous steps to get an overview of the new card before continuing where you left off. <br> <br>Activity <br>1:1 <br>Say the name of the card you have chosen aloud: <br>"I've drawn 10, the Wheel of Fortune." <br>"You received the Four of Pentacles." <br>"This card is the King of Cups." <br>"I got 13, Transformation, which is usually called Death." <br> <br>That's all there is to this first step. Say the name of the card! It seems obvious but don't overlook doing it. Time after time, I see students look at a card in desperate silence, with no idea of what to say or where to begin. <br> <br>Saying the name of the card opens your mouth and starts it moving-what I call "priming the pump" or getting the ideas flowing. You'll then find it's easier to say the next thing and the next. Naming something helps you own it and thus connects you to what you know about it. It's like a key that unlocks a gate-sometimes a floodgate-of information. <br> <br>Activity <br>1:2 <br> <br>If you are new to tarot or have just purchased an unusual deck, shuffle it and then examine the cards, one by one, saying their names as you do so. This simple exercise will help familiarize you with this particular pack. <br> <br>The Way of the Adept <br> <br>You can continue exploring this step now or come back later, after trying out the other ways to read a tarot card. <br> <br>Before beginning a reading, you should have psychically grounded yourself, paid attention to your breath, and shuffled the cards. Step 1 establishes an essential quality in a reading: a focused state. Now you bring your focus to bear on a single card and what it has to offer. Naming the card is a formal introduction to the energies before you, an acknowledgment of the players in the game. <br> <br>The tone and emphasis you use when naming the card will convey a tremendous amount of information in itself. You might surprise yourself with a feeling you didn't know you had. For instance, you might greet the Empress with a sense of letdown-"Oh, the Empress"-only realizing later that you were hoping for a little more dynamic and assertive card. If reading for a querent, you can disarm their assumptions about a card by your manner of naming it. For example, you might greet a disturbing card by cheerfully exclaiming, "How exciting, you've drawn the Tower!" The task then becomes to convey what makes this card so exciting. Don't overdo it and definitely don't fake a response. In general, you are best served by being open and curious about why this particular card appears at this place and time. Always pay close attention to first impressions, both when reading for yourself and with a querent. <br> <br>When reading for another, empathize with their first response to a card. Acknowledge and support their response before continuing. <br> <br>Activity <br>1:3 <br>Shuffle your deck. Ask the question, "Who am I?" Then turn over a card and say its name. Notice any physical response in your body as you first see the card and name it. Did you hold your breath or did you inhale, as if to take in the card? Did you move subtly back or forward? Was there any tenseness or relaxation? What was your very first sensory impression-a flush, a chill, an increased heartbeat, surprise, disappointment, satisfaction, nostalgia? Try this with two or three more cards. <br> <br>Activity <br>1:4 <br>Have another person draw a card for the same question. Say the name of the card. Simultaneously note the person's initial physical response. Tell the person what you observed and then ask what her first impression was. For example, Amy draws a card and I tell her, "It's the Ten of Coins." Then I say, "You moved forward slightly when you saw it and seemed to smile. What's going on?" Amy responds, "I'd like having that many coins and my own family." Was the response what you expected?<br></p><h2>Someone to Remember: Matilda&#39;s Story (The Westcott Series)</h2><p><b>It&#x2019;s never too late to fall in love in this enchanting new story, a novella in the Westcott series from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mary Balogh.</b><br><br>Matilda Westcott has spent her life tending to the needs of her mother, the Dowager Countess of Riverdale, never questioning the web of solitude she has spun herself.

Their conversation had followed predictable lines for several minutes-inquiries after the health of Matilda and her mother, and news of their young children and those of Elizabeth, Alexander's sister, and Colin, Lord Hodges, her husband, with all of whom they had enjoyed a picnic in Richmond Park the day before. But now they had changed the subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wren and I have decided that we really ought to invite Viscount Dirkson to dine with us," Alexander said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ought?" Matilda's mother, the Dowager Countess of Riverdale, asked sharply. Matilda meanwhile had gone still, the teapot poised over the third cup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"As a sort of thank-you, Cousin Eugenia," Wren explained. "Not that any of us need to thank him, exactly. Gil is his son, after all. But Viscount Dirkson has had no dealings with Gil all his life and might easily have ignored that custody hearing a couple of weeks ago. His absence might have made no difference in the judge's decision, of course. On the other hand, perhaps it did make a difference. And we want him to know that we appreciate what he did. For Abigail's sake. And for Gil's and Katy's sakes. We have invited him for tomorrow, and he has accepted."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But we would like it to be a family dinner," Alexander said. "Not all the Westcotts are in town, of course, but we hope those who are will join us." He smiled his very charming smile, first at Matilda's mother and then at Matilda herself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda scarcely noticed as she proceeded to pour the third cup of tea with a hand she held steady.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was invited too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She should have been delighted. While the last earl, Humphrey, her brother, was alive, the Westcotts had not been nearly as close a family as they were now. He had had little use for any of them, even his wife and son and daughters. And he had done terrible things during his life, the very worst of which was to marry twice. That was not a crime in itself, but in his case it was. His first, secret marriage, to Alice Snow, had produced one equally secret daughter, Anna. His second marriage, to Viola, his countess for twenty-three years, had produced three children-Camille, Harry, and Abigail. The criminal aspect of the second marriage was that it had overlapped by with the first a month or two before Alice died of consumption. As a result Viola and her offspring had ended up dispossessed while Anna, who had grown up in an orphanage, not knowing even who she was, had inherited a vast fortune, and the whole family had been thrown into turmoil, for the bigamous nature of Humphrey's second marriage had been unearthed only after his death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May he not rest in peace, Matilda was often very tempted to think, even to say aloud. A very unsisterly sentiment, no doubt, not to mention unladylike. She often gave in to the temptation to think it nevertheless-as she did now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She should have been delighted by the invitation, as Alexander was a far different sort of earl than Humphrey had been and had worked hard to draw the family together. However, the dinner was in honor of someone outside the family. Viscount Dirkson. Charles. A man Matilda would be very happy never to set eyes upon again for at least the rest of her life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had all started when Abigail Westcott, Humphrey's younger daughter, had arrived unexpectedly in London a few weeks ago with an equally unexpected husband, whom she had married the day before. Lieutenant Colonel Gil Bennington had seemed a perfectly respectable young gentleman-he was a military friend of Harry, Abigail's brother. However, he had proceeded to reveal to Abigail's family that in reality he grew up as a gutter rat-his words-with his unmarried mother, who had scraped together a living as a village washerwoman. The family had been duly shocked. It really, truly was shocking, after all. Matilda had liked the young man anyway. He was tall and dark and handsome even if his face was marred by the scar of an old battle wound and even if he did tend to look upon the world with a dour expression. She had thought the sudden marriage wondrously romantic. She had fallen into shock only when Lieutenant Colonel Bennington had admitted, when pressed, that his father, with whom he had had no dealings all his life, was Viscount Dirkson.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had been Charles Sawyer when Matilda had had an acquaintance with him, ages ago, aeons ago. A lifetime. The title had come later, upon the death of his father.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she had had a dealing with him since Gil's revelation-a secret, horribly scandalous dealing that would shock her family to the roots if they knew about it. The memory of it could still turn her cold enough to faint quite away-if she were the vaporish sort, which she was not. Well, it was not a secret from all of them. Young Bertrand Lamarr knew. He was Abigail's stepbrother, not a Westcott by birth but accepted by all of them as an honorary family member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What had happened was that she, a single lady, had called upon Viscount Dirkson, a widowed gentleman, at his London home, with only young Bertrand as a companion to lend a semblance of respectability to what was in reality quite beyond the pale of it. She had screwed her courage to the sticking point, to quote someone in a Shakespeare play-Lady Macbeth?-though it might not be a strictly accurate quotation. Anyway, she had gone to persuade Charles to do something at last for his natural son, who was about to appear before a judge to plead for the return of his young daughter, who had been taken to the home of her maternal grandparents while Gil was away fighting at the Battle of Waterloo, and was never returned. It was the first time in thirty-six years she had come face-to-face with Charles or exchanged a word with him. After she had said her piece she had left with Bertrand, and she had comforted herself-tried to, at least-with the thought that that was the end of it. Finished. The end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now Alexander and Wren had invited him to a family dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And she was a member of the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles Sawyer also happened to be the only man Matilda had ever loved. All of thirty-six years ago. More than half a biblical lifetime ago. She was fifty-six now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the cups had been filled, Matilda saw, and must be distributed before the tea in them turned cold. Her mother was talking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Viscount Dirkson is to be rewarded, then, for fathering a son out of wedlock and doing nothing for him in the more than thirty years since, until he spoke up on his son's behalf before a judge a few weeks ago?" she asked as Matilda set a cup of tea on the table beside her and made sure it was close enough for her to reach but not so close as to be knocked over by a careless elbow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wren came to take Alexander's and her cups from the tray and smiled her thanks to Matilda. "He did purchase his son's first commission some years ago, if you will recall, Cousin Eugenia," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dowager made a sound of derision and batted away her daughter's hand when Matilda tried to rearrange her shawl, which had slipped off one shoulder. "Don't fuss, Matilda."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And that son is now married to Abigail and is therefore a member of our family," Alexander added, taking his cup and saucer from Wren's hand. "But even aside from purchasing the commission, what Dirkson did a couple of weeks ago was significant. Without his recommendation at the court hearing, Gil might very well not have regained custody of his daughter, and both he and Abigail would have been distraught. Dirkson would surely have attended the hearing for his own sake, of course, since Gil is his son. However, Wren and I feel an obligation to thank him on behalf of Abigail's family. Do say you will come too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It is nothing short of a miracle that Viscount Dirkson even found out about the custody hearing," Wren said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it had not happened by a miracle, Matilda thought as she picked up her own cup and sipped her tea. There was nothing miraculous about her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You are very quiet this afternoon, Matilda," Alexander said, smiling kindly at her. "What do you think? Will you come to our dinner? Will you persuade Cousin Eugenia to come too?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her opinion was rarely solicited. She was merely an appendage of her mother as she fussed over her, making sure she did not sit in a draft or overexert herself or get overexcited, though her mother resented her every attention. Sometimes, especially lately, Matilda wondered whether her mother needed her at all-or even loved her. It was a thought that depressed her horribly, for if the love and care she gave her mother were pointless, then what had been the purpose of her life? And why was she already thinking of it in the past tense?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it is an admirable idea," she said. "You are a worthy Earl of Riverdale, Alexander. You take your responsibility as head of the family seriously. Inviting Viscount Dirkson to dine with as many of the family as are in London is a good way of showing him that we appreciate his speaking up for Gil. It will show him that we consider Gil one of us, that we value his happiness and Abigail's. And Katy's."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katy was Gil's daughter-and Charles's granddaughter. That realization stabbed a little painfully at Matilda's heart every time her mind touched upon it. He had other grandchildren. Both of his daughters were married and both were mothers. His son, the youngest of his offspring, was as yet unwed. His wife of twenty years or so had died five years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander looked pleased at her praise. "You will come, then," he said. "Thank you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, she would go, though the very thought made her feel bilious. He was still so very handsome. Charles, that was. Whereas she . . . well, she was an aging spinster, perhaps even an aged one, and . . . Well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And will you invite Viscount Dirkson's family too?" her mother was asking. "His son and his daughters?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It is hardly likely they know of Gil's existence," Alexander said, frowning. "I doubt he would want them to know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Perhaps," Wren said, "we ought to inform Viscount Dirkson that he is welcome to bring his children if he wishes, Alexander. Let the decision be his."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I will do that, my love," he said, nodding to Matilda, who was offering to pour him a second cup of tea. "Yes, thank you. You will come, Cousin Eugenia?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I will," she said. "Dirkson ran wild with Humphrey as a young man, you know, though he did not have the title in those days. His reputation became increasingly unsavory as time went on. He was not welcomed by the highest sticklers and perhaps still is not."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think we will not hold the past against him," Alexander said, a twinkle in his eye. "If he had not fathered an illegitimate child when he must have been a very young man, we would not even be planning this dinner, would we?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And Abigail would not have found the love of her life," Matilda said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, I think you are right about that, Cousin Matilda," Wren said, beaming warmly at her. "I believe she and Gil are perfect for each other and perfect parents for Katy. No, no more tea for me, thank you. We must be on our way soon. We have taken enough of your time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But we have not told you our own very happy news," the dowager said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh," Wren said. "We must certainly hear that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And Matilda was instantly reminded of why she had been feeling severely out of sorts even before Alexander and Wren arrived with their invitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Edith is coming to live with us," her mother announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Your sister, Cousin Eugenia, do you mean?" Alexander asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Edith Monteith, yes," the dowager said. "I have been trying to persuade her to come ever since Douglas died a couple of years ago. She has neither chick nor child to keep her living in that drafty heap of a mansion all the way up as near to the Scottish border as makes no difference. It will be far better for her to come to me. She was always my favorite sister even though she is almost ten years younger than I."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And she is coming to live permanently with you?" Wren asked. "That does indeed sound like good news." But she looked with a concerned frown at Matilda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her mother must have seen the look. "It is going to be wonderful for Matilda too," she said. "She will not be tied to the apron strings of an old woman any longer. She will have someone closer to her own age for companionship. Adelaide Boniface will be coming with Edith. She is a distant cousin of Douglas's and quite indigent, poor thing. She has been Edith's companion for years."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Edith had suffered from low spirits since as far back as Matilda could remember, and Adelaide Boniface made good and certain they remained low. If the sun was shining, it was surely the harbinger of clouds and rain to come. If there was half a cake left on the plate for tea, then the fact that half of it was gone was cause for lamentation, for there would be none tomorrow. And she spoke habitually in a nasal whine while the offending nose was constantly being dabbed at and pushed from side to side with a balled-up handkerchief, the whole operation followed each time by a dry sniff. Matilda found the prospect of having her constant companionship, not to mention Aunt Edith's, quite intolerable. She really did not know how she was going to endure such an invasion of her home and her very life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I am very happy for you both, then," Alexander said, setting aside his cup and getting to his feet. "Are they coming soon?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"After we go home to the country at the end of the Season," the dowager told him. "We are certainly happy about it, are we not, Matilda?"</p></p><h2>Wired</h2><p><b>A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate&#x2014;in more ways than one&#x2014;in this sexy, suspenseful novel from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Julie Garwood.</b><br><br>Allison Trent doesn't look like a hacker.

She had wiggled across the line many times before, but she&#x2019;d never done anything so bold or blatant. Within a couple of years she had accumulated more than eighty million dollars. On paper that would have made her a titan. In reality she was as poor as a church mouse.</p><p>The motivation to commit the first crime came to Allison quite unexpectedly as she was sitting on an overstuffed sofa in a coffee shop close to the Boston College campus. She was working on a class project that was due the next day and was so completely focused on the computer sitting on her lap that she was oblivious of the activity around her, not even hearing the news broadcast coming from the television that was suspended from the wall opposite her&#x2014;that is, until the words &#x201c;terrible injustice&#x201d; broke through her concentration and drew her eyes up to the screen. The young male reporter seemed genuinely sympathetic as he read his story from the teleprompter. The subject was a local nursing home called Sunset Gardens, one of twenty homes for the elderly located across the East Coast, owned and operated by a corporation out of Philadelphia. The corporate home offices, he explained, kept a database with vital information pertaining to every single one of their clients. They were vigilant in protecting privacy, had all the bells and whistles installed to keep personal data iron-proof against bugs and viruses, and had paid a hefty salary to a tech whose only job was to monitor the system. None of that mattered, though. Their system had been hacked, and the identities of all the residents in all twenty facilities were stolen with one keystroke. And because First National was designated as the official bank for all Sunset Garden homes and their residents, within minutes its accounts were wiped out as well.</p><p>The reporter went on to point out that a large number of the residents had no family to help them, and while the money in First National was FDIC insured, it could take the authorities a good long while to sort through the facts and reimburse every account.</p><p>What were the residents supposed to do until then? Allison wondered.</p><p>A sense of outrage was growing inside her as she listened to the catastrophic details of the crime, but the tragedy hit home when the reporter played a clip of his interview with one of the elderly residents. Her name was Ella O&#x2019;Connor. He knelt beside Ella&#x2019;s wheelchair and held her veiny hand as he asked her what the news meant to her.</p><p>Ella&#x2019;s watery eyes stared at the reporter for a moment as though she was trying to understand the question. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said. And then a look of despair crossed her face. &#x201c;I hope they don&#x2019;t make me leave.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella was all alone, afraid, and feeling helpless. Allison knew exactly how that felt. Her heart went out to Ella and all the other poor souls. Some of them would die before it was all sorted out, and in their golden years dealing with such stress and fear would be traumatic. What had happened to them was beyond cruel.</p><p>An interview with the president of the Sunset Gardens Corporation was played next. With a shrug in his voice he said, &#x201c;The authorities told me it was most likely the Russians behind the hacking. Or possibly the Chinese. The truth is, we may never know.&#x201d;</p><p>His defeated &#x201c;Oh well, what can you do?&#x201d; attitude infuriated Allison. She knew the FBI had experts trying to locate the hackers and shut them down, but it was apparent they hadn&#x2019;t had any luck so far. The invasion of secure systems was becoming an epidemic. Just the week before, the news agencies had announced that the Pentagon had been hacked. The FBI was certain the Russians were behind the theft of employee information then as well, but proving it was a huge challenge.</p><p>What could she do? Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe. It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to try to find the Sunset Garden hackers, would it?</p><p>Was it her ego or arrogance that made her think she might succeed? She had always had the ability to solve complex problems. Even at an early age her thought processes were out of the box. She was just eight years old when her uncanny ability was first noticed. Her older sister, Charlotte, had bought a five-hundred-piece jigsaw puzzle at a yard sale and placed all the tiny pieces on the floor in their room. When Allison came home from school, Charlotte asked her if she wanted to help put the puzzle together. Allison knelt on the floor and stared at the scattered pieces for no more than a minute or two while her brain studied them. Not only could she tell Charlotte what the picture was, but she knew where the pieces fit. It was as though she was watching each part of the puzzle connect to the next. After separating the tiny cardboard tiles into six piles, she went to work. Charlotte watched in amazement. In less than five minutes, Allison had the perimeter of the square picture put together, and within another twenty, the entire puzzle was completed. Allison didn&#x2019;t think she had accomplished anything unusual, but Charlotte was clearly impressed. She told Allison that most people didn&#x2019;t look at things the way she did.</p><p>The nursing home story broke just as Christmas break was coming up. Allison was a sophomore at Boston College at the time and planned to spend the holiday alone. Charlotte and her husband, Oliver, had moved to Seattle a couple of years ago.&nbsp; They had offered to buy a plane ticket for her to come, but knowing they were saving up to buy a house, Allison declined their generosity. &nbsp;Allison&#x2019;s only other relatives were her aunt and uncle, and she would rather have slept on the street than spent the holiday with them.</p><p>Allison and Charlotte had been very young when Aunt Jane and Uncle Russell became their legal guardians. The couple had one son, Will, who was two years older than Allison, and the atmosphere of their home was neither warm nor welcoming. An air of constant friction permeated the place, usually stemming from something Will had done. He never showed any signs of ambition or responsibility, and he hung around with a group of creepy misfits. The only talent he seemed to have was a knack for getting into trouble&#x2014;or mischief, as Uncle Russell called his skirmishes with the police.</p><p>To Allison, her aunt and uncle and cousin were her poor excuse for relatives. Charlotte was her only family. When they were children, their aunt had often threatened to split them up if they didn&#x2019;t obey and keep quiet, and the possibility of never seeing her sister again had terrified Allison. She&#x2019;d felt so helpless. She would have done anything to keep that from happening. Her fear, plus her sense of obligation to them for taking Charlotte and her into their home when they had nowhere else to go, had kept her compliant. However, now that she was an adult and had moved away from their house, she felt a new sense of freedom.</p><p>Since Allison was spending the holiday vacation alone, she decided to use the time off to focus her full attention on the hackers. She was confident the vast forces at the FBI would find the culprits eventually, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to leave the task to them. It could take too long.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t get very far in her search during break, yet she didn&#x2019;t give up. Every moment of spare time she could steal between her classes was spent on her hunt. She was well aware of the chance she was taking, and she knew how careful she had to be. Breaking into protected sites was against the law, and yet she wasn&#x2019;t deterred. She couldn&#x2019;t get the elderly victims out of her mind. Finding their money was becoming an obsession.</p><p>A breakthrough came when she gained access to the bank&#x2019;s servers and tracked the thief&#x2019;s withdrawals to various bank accounts that had been set up in a number of European countries. As she suspected, those had been closed within seconds of the deposits, and the money was routed to other accounts. Ultimately she traced the funds to a consolidated account in the Ukraine, and from there it was dispersed once again into smaller bank accounts. With each discovery, she became more and more certain the attack was not carried out by a cyber syndicate, but rather by a small group of hackers or maybe even a lone wolf, someone who had devised an elaborate plan to find a vulnerable target and drain the funds before anyone could detect the theft. Step by step, she unraveled the knots.</p><p>After a month of searching she hadn&#x2019;t found the source, but she could feel she was closing in. A long weekend was coming up and she was excited to have the extra time. The minute her classes ended on Friday afternoon, she hurried to her house off campus to resume her quest. Changing into her favorite fleece sweats and fuzzy slippers, she propped pillows against the bed&#x2019;s headboard and leaned back, her laptop on her outstretched legs. Around three in the morning, just as she was about to call it quits for the night, she found the last link&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and presto, she had them.</p><p>Her discovery surprised her. The theft wasn&#x2019;t carried out by the Russians or the Chinese after all. All of the routing and rerouting through foreign banks turned out to be just a clever way of diverting attention. The real source was actually on the West Coast of the United States. The hackers were two seniors and one grad student at Stanford University. Their carefully hidden accounts, all containing some form of their initials, CHF, for their first names, Charles, Harold, and Franklin, had a total of thirty-eight million dollars. Certainly not chump change by any hacker&#x2019;s standards.</p><p>Allison was euphoric for a good fifteen minutes before worry set in. The way the three men moved money around was a concern. That thirty-eight million could be gone by morning, and she would have to spend God knows how long tracking it down again.</p><p>She knew what she needed to do. She just didn&#x2019;t know if she had the courage to do it. If she messed up, she could get thirty years in prison, she thought, even as she realized she couldn&#x2019;t and wouldn&#x2019;t let those three greedy lowlifes take what didn&#x2019;t belong to them.</p><p>&#x201c;Screw it,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how you like feeling helpless.&#x201d;</p><p>She could imagine how angry they were going to be when they realized they had been hacked, and thinking about it made her smile.</p><p>The first thing she did was steal the money. All thirty-eight million. She put it in a secure account she made certain they would never be able to find, then set about gathering the proof to nail them. She carefully retraced each step they&#x2019;d taken, including each routing number, each transfer number, and each account number. Once that was done and the proof was indisputable, she sent the evidence and the thirty-eight million to the FBI. She, of course, made certain the e-mail she was about to send couldn&#x2019;t be traced back to her.</p><p>&#x201c;This is for you, Ella,&#x201d; she said as she triple-checked her work, then typed the e-mail address for the FBI cyber task force and hit send.</p><p>Her message for the FBI was to the point. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just a possibility anymore. He hated when a hunch became a reality.</p><p>Liam Scott walked through the bar of the beach hotel and spotted his friend and colleague Alec Buchanan sitting outside on the veranda. The stars were so bright in the vast Honolulu sky the tiny lights strung overhead between the palms were almost redundant.</p><p>Alec had changed from his work clothes and was wearing a pair of cargo shorts, worn-out loafers, and an old T-shirt that was so faded the name of the 5K charity race it was promoting was illegible. He was leaning back in his chair with his legs outstretched, holding a beer, and watching the surf&#x2019;s hypnotic ebb and swell. He looked as though he was a tourist on the tail end of a long relaxing vacation and not an agent who had just completed one of the most intense investigations of his FBI career.</p><p>Liam hadn&#x2019;t changed out of his suit yet. When he reached Alec, he took his phone from his pocket and laid it on the table, then removed his jacket and tie, draping them on the back of the rattan chair before unbuttoning his collar.</p><p>&#x201c;I ordered you a Guinness,&#x201d; Alec told him.</p><p>Liam dropped into the chair. &#x201c;Thanks. I could use one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like we should have this wrapped up tomorrow. Just as long as Meyer doesn&#x2019;t get cold feet.&#x201d; He tipped his bottle to Liam in salute and said, &#x201c;I appreciate your coming in on this case. I don&#x2019;t think we could have located Meyer without you and your international connections.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If Meyer&#x2019;s testimony brings down Dimitri Volkov and his syndicate, that&#x2019;s all the thanks I need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was surprised we got him to turn so quickly. I thought he&#x2019;d hold out longer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no spring chicken. I guess the thought of the rest of his life in maximum security was enough of an incentive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is he now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The team&#x2019;s helping him pack up, and they&#x2019;ll be moving him into a safe house. If they can keep him under wraps long enough, Volkov and his army of lawyers won&#x2019;t be able to line up a defense. They&#x2019;ll never suspect that Meyer is going to testify against his old partner.&#x201d;</p><p>A waitress appeared and set a glass of the murky dark brew in front of Liam. She was wearing a yellow bikini. A colorful scarf tied around her waist created a wrap that was so short it barely covered her firm little derriere. She wore no shoes, and Liam eyed her long tan legs appreciatively.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything else I can get you?&#x201d; she asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; Liam answered.</p><p>She lingered for a moment and slid her gaze up and down his body. She then gave him a seductive smile and said, &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s anything I can do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you just let me know, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Liam and Alec watched her saunter back to the bar.

The experience of direct involvement with the present moment was just the place in which he had previously been unable to dwell. He was determined now to stay put. He knew that, paradoxically, some great success was buried within his failure. He sensed that he had had some kind of awakening. But what was it?<br><br>Yogis call this state <i>samvega&#x2013;</i>a complex state involving a kind of disillusionment with mundane life, and a wholehearted longing for a deeper investigation into the inner workings of the mind and the self.1 <i>Samvega</i>, as described by the contemporary Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu, involves &#x201c;at least three clusters of feelings at once&#x201d;:<br><br>the oppressive sense of shock, dismay, and alienation that come with realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life as it&#x2019;s normally lived; a chastening sense of our own complacency and foolishness in having let ourselves live so blindly; and an anxious sense of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless cycle.2<br><br><i>Samvega </i>is a developmental state not mentioned in Western psychological texts. It brings with it a realization that objects of grasping (money, fine things, titles, fame, even people&#x2013;when seen as objects) cannot supply any true satisfaction. It involves a radical realization that all objects are intrinsically empty of the capacity to feed us in the way we really want&#x2013;or need&#x2013;to be fed.<br><br>A classic Buddhist teaching story describes this realization:<br><br>A dog stumbles across a bone that has been exposed to the elements for many months, and is therefore bleached of any residual flesh or marrow. The dog gnaws on it for some time before he finally determines that he is &#x201c;not finding&#x201d; any satisfaction in the bone, and he thus turns away from it in disgust. It is not that the bone is intrinsically disgusting; it is rather the case that the dog&#x2019;s raging desire for meat just will not be satisfied by the bone . . . when he wakes up to the truth that the bone is empty of anything that will offer him satisfaction, he becomes disenchanted, and spits it out in disgust.3<br><br>Of course, the symptoms of <i>samvega </i>arise only after extensive experimentation with &#x201c;the bone.&#x201d; Tibetan teacher Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche says it elegantly: &#x201c;The shoe of ego is only worn out by walking on it.&#x201d;4 For many of us, objects of longing gradually reveal themselves to offer no real happiness. No matter how hard we gnaw on them, we find no meat on the bone. <i>Samvega </i>then arises with a linked complex of symptoms, many of which Jake was now experiencing. These can include:<br><br>� A puzzling failure of previous sources of satisfaction<br>� A heightened concern with authenticity<br>� A deepening pull toward an intuited interior world<br>� A sense of urgency about realizing deeply hidden gifts and talents<br>� A global and diffuse sense of internal disorganization&#x2013;equal parts psychological and spiritual<br>� A deeply felt internal imperative to stop business as usual&#x2013;or, as Jake said, to &#x201c;get quiet&#x201d;<br>� A call to explore a path that might give transcendent meaning to the enigmas of life<br><br>One of the harbingers of the developmental imperative of <i>samvega </i>is that we&#x2013;like Jake&#x2013;begin to hear ourselves muttering about our Old Life and our New Life. Out of the blue, we begin to feel like captives in our lives&#x2013;lives which may have fit comfortably for years. Our well-known world begins to feel stale and dead. Gradually we start hankering to leave for the New World. We begin to feel imbued with the spirit of our Seeker ancestors. We want nothing more than to leave the Old Country. This internal movement presages a profound reorganization of the psyche, a redirection of the energy of longing, and a completely new relationship with the world of people, places, and things.<br><br>Even though this developmental stage is as common in human life as adolescence, one will search Western psychology books in vain for a clear description of its causes and trajectory. We ordinarily attempt to fit the complexities of <i>samvega </i>into our old, usually pathological, categories. We trivialize it as &#x201c;midlife crisis,&#x201d; or we wonder if it is not really just neurotic depression, or regression&#x2013;as Susan Goldstein did when encountering Jake&#x2019;s version of <i>samvega</i>.<br><br>But contrary to the typical Western view, the kind of &#x201c;breakdown&#x201d; in which Jake found himself is not a regression into the past. It is not a pathological state. It is not a move backward at all. It is, rather, a step toward the possibility of a vastly expanded way of living in the world.<br><br>In yogic texts, the word <i>samvega </i>is often translated as &#x201c;vehemence,&#x201d; because it brings with it an unshakeable resolve to develop into a fully alive human being. Patanjali introduces the term <i>samvega</i> in the first chapter of the <i>Yoga-S�utra&#x2013;</i>using the word to indicate a &#x201c;wholehearted&#x201d; (or &#x201c;vehement&#x201d;) determination to find a way out of suffering.<br><b><br><i>For those who seek liberation wholeheartedly, realization is near. How near depends on whether the practice is mild, moderate, or intense. </i></b>(1.21&#x2014;22)<b><i><br></i></b><br>Yogis found that even though this state of &#x201c;vehemence&#x201d; carries with it a tremendous amount of feeling and power, it does not disturb the mind&#x2013;rather it calms the mind. (In the summer of his breakthrough, everyone noticed that Jake was not disturbed. He was calm and profoundly &#x201c;resolved.&#x201d;) <i>Samvega </i>is a kind of passion that does not create suffering&#x2013;but, rather, generates the happiness that comes with the sure knowledge of freedom. Because the state of <i>samvega </i>is so full of possibilities, it is often referred to as a state of &#x201c;emergence.&#x201d; Through the practice of yoga, says Patanjali, we can emerge from the traps of ordinary suffering. How quickly this emergence takes place depends on the intensity and persistence of our practice.<br><i><br><br>NIRODHA: </i><b>STOP THE WORLD<br></b><br>When <i>samvega </i>emerges, it brings with it an altogether new hunger: the hunger for internal quiet. We seek this quiet not just because we&#x2019;re exhausted by living at right angles to life&#x2013;as Jake certainly was&#x2013;but also so that we can see more clearly. It becomes obvious that in order to know our true nature, we will have to stop the world. Stop the world! The Native American shaman Don Juan gives precisely this advice to his student Carlos Castaneda. &#x201c;In order to become a man of knowledge, a warrior-traveler, you will first have to learn to stop the world.&#x201d;5<br><br>What does this mean? In order to see clearly, to examine how things work, we will have to stop our lives, slow things down, look carefully&#x2013;like the person who has suddenly discovered she has created the mother of all knots in the shoelace of her boot. We must stop. Slow down. Look. Examine. How did this happen? How does this work? How can I reverse this? We will have to deconstruct the very way we perceive and rebuild it again from the ground up.<br><br>Stop the world. The impulse toward stillness is the central movement of the contemplative life. Monastics through the ages have described it: One intuits some precious new interior self. One sneaks off into the woods like an animal, builds a nest for the birth. Guards it ferociously. And waits in silence.<br><br>Says Thomas Merton, one of the great Catholic contemplatives of the twentieth century:<br><br>The true contemplative is not one who prepares his mind for a particular message that he wants or expects to hear, but is one who remains empty because he knows that he can never expect to anticipate the words that will transform his darkness into light. He does not even anticipate a special kind of transformation. He does not demand light instead of darkness. He waits on the Word of God in silence, and, when he is answered it is not so much by a word that bursts into his silence. It is by his silence itself, suddenly, inexplicably revealing itself to him as a word of great power, full of the voice of God.6<br><br>Jake had an urgent need to stop the world. And he discovered, as all strivers do, that when the mind is still, our true nature begins to reveal itself. Out of stillness, like the early morning mist on the lake, emerges a thinking that is not thinking&#x2013;a wisdom beyond thought. Out of stillness emerges, effortlessly, a subtle world of experience for which we had only longed until now. It is real. It rolls itself out in waves as we get still, quiet, concentrated, and settled.<br><br>The path of classical yoga is organized around the relationship between inner stillness and wisdom. The first two <i>sutras </i>in Patanjali&#x2019;s<br><i>Yogasutra </i>are:<br><b><i>Now, the teachings of yoga.<br>Yoga is to still the patterning of consciousness. </i></b>(1.1&#x2014;2)<br><b><br></b>The Sanskrit word <i>nirodha, </i>which Patanjali uses in the second <i>sutra</i>, means &#x201c;stilling, cessation, or restriction.&#x201d; This stilling is both the path and the goal of yoga. Its appearance at the beginning of the treatise signals its centrality in Patanjali&#x2019;s technique.<br><br>&#x201c;Yoga is to still the patterning of consciousness.&#x201d; Yoga is to still the thought waves of the mind. Yoga is to bring a natural quiet to the mind and body&#x2013;so that we can, for the first time, see clearly. And in this stillness&#x2013;miraculously, outrageously&#x2013;the knots undo themselves.<br>Inner realities emerge.<br><br>As both Merton and Don Juan understood, inner stillness opens a doorway in the mind. A little trapdoor we have rarely noticed. A secret escape hatch for the mind that is not even in the Western psychological user&#x2019;s manual. Merton&#x2019;s prayer suggests that in order to be found, we must first acknowledge the radical degree to which we&#x2019;re lost. Then, as the poet David Wagoner suggests, we must pay very close attention:<br><i><br>Stand still. The trees ahead and the bushes beside you<br>Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,<br>And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,<br>Must ask permission to know it and be known.<br>The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,<br>I have made this place around you.<br>If you leave it you may come back again, saying Here.<br>No two trees are the same to Raven.<br>No two branches are the same to Wren.<br>If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,<br>You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows<br>Where you are. You must let it find you.7<br></i><br>This teaching captures the essence of the yogic view: what we are searching for is also searching for us. The way is to stop. To let ourselves be found. Stand still.<br><br>The Sanskrit word <i>marga </i>means &#x201c;the way&#x201d; or &#x201c;the path.&#x201d; It is often used to refer to the yogic system for uncovering Reality. But interestingly, the word originally referred to &#x201c;the hunter&#x2019;s path.&#x201d; This image of the hunter underlies much of the practice of yoga. Practice is seen as a kind of hunt for the real&#x2013;for the lurking wild game of our true nature. Author and Zen practitioner David Chadwick suggests that hunting is one of the experiential origins of contemplative practice. &#x201c;Hunters,&#x201d; he points out, &#x201c;have had to sit and wait motionless, even for days at a time. The course is unknown ahead of time to the hunter, who must sniff and look for signs and watch and wait.&#x201d;8<br><br>In order to understand the path of the strivers, we will have to convince ourselves of the necessity, the magic, the absolute brilliance of stillness. Over and over again we will have to do this. We will forget. Farther down the path, tomorrow, or perhaps later today, we will forget about stillness. And when we do, we will have lost the thread. Without this central practice, none of it will make any sense.<br><br>In the wisdom of the strivers, we find an answer for those of us overheated by the search for the elusive Firebird. Stop. Become still and quiet. Stop the world. Stand perfectly still and listen. Kafka said it so well:<br><br>You don&#x2019;t need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Don&#x2019;t even listen, simply wait. Don&#x2019;t even wait. Be quite still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you. It has no choice. It will roll in ecstasy at your feet.9<br><br>During the summer of his breakdown, Jake sought true contemplative stillness for the first time in his life. His resolve astonished me. Some days he would sit on a bench behind the old colonial church on the hill in Lenox, gazing at the eighteenth century graveyard. For Jake, experiencing the state of <i>samvega</i>, the cemetery seemed just the place to be&#x2013;an excellent vantage point from which to ponder the meaning of life.<br><br>Jake and I spent a lot of time together that summer. He had become to me a newly fascinating human being. We met regularly in the cemetery behind the church&#x2013;which was just across the street from my house (and Maggie&#x2019;s). When wandering the cemetery Jake and I spoke a lot about death. I recalled for him the teaching that Yaqui shaman Don Juan had given to his student, anthropologist Carlos Castaneda: &#x201c;The thing to do when you&#x2019;re confused,&#x201d; instructed the shaman, &#x201c;is to turn to your left and ask advice from your death. An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if you just have the feeling that your companion is watching you.&#x201d;10<br><br>Jake wandered among the stones sometimes for hours at a time, perhaps hoping to get a glimpse of his own death. Or a longer perspective on his life. And so, that summer, Jake sat and peered and wandered and prayed and listened&#x2013;like a hunter who wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was hunting or being hunted.

Visit www.homesicktexan.com.Introduction<br> There&#x2019;s this recurring dream that I have. I&#x2019;m in a field&#x2014;my great-grandma&#x2019;s Texas cornfield to be exact. A long table loaded with dishes, bowls, and platters full of good food stretches through the green stalks, and surrounding the table is most everyone I&#x2019;ve ever known, both family and friends. My great-grandmother is there, and she waves me over. &#x201c;Mighty fine food and mighty fine people to eat it!&#x201d; she says as I take a seat. I then begin to eat a most memorable meal.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s been said that if you ask a Texan about their most memorable meal, they won&#x2019;t tell you about a coveted reservation at a five-star temple of dining, or an exotic feast served after an airplane flight halfway across the world. Nope, most Texans will say that their most memorable meal was home-cooked, shared at the family table.<br><br> At least it&#x2019;s that way for me.&nbsp;<br><br> But to be honest&#x2014;despite my recurring dream&#x2014;I hadn&#x2019;t really pondered the question until some New York friends and I were having dinner at my apartment. Now, before I continue, let me say I&#x2019;m a seventh-generation Texan who happens to live in New York, and one of my favorite pastimes is to share the joys of my home state with my non-Texan friends.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That particular evening was Tex-Mex night. As we sat around dipping tortilla chips into salsas and quesos, my friends talked about elaborate meals from fine establishments located in places such as Napa Valley or Spain. But when it was my turn to answer the question, even though I&#x2019;ve enjoyed eating in a fair share of fancy restaurants, I realized my most memorable meal was the potluck we had for my grandparents&#x2019; fiftieth anniversary.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A potluck?&#x201d; said my friends.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, a family potluck,&#x201d; I said. Then I told them about the meal.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was early July, and while Texas is notorious for being hotter than heck during the summer, that day was blessed with a gentle breeze. The party was held at my grandparents&#x2019; North Texas farm&#x2014;a beautiful spread of green pastures, rolling hills, and a pond&#x2014;which has been continuously owned by my family since the 1840s.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through the course of the party, more than one hundred people came by to pay their respects&#x2014;a lively gathering of folks young and old. I had recently moved to New York, so for me, a visit to the peaceful farm was a much-needed tonic from the craziness of city life. But beyond seeing the beautiful land, it was a treat to visit with dear family and friends, many of whom I hadn&#x2019;t seen in years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The food at the anniversary party was typical mid-summer Texan fare&#x2014;cold salads, hot rolls, chicken, cake, and pies. The food was good, as it was all made with love. But what made the meal truly special were the connections made with family and friends, old and new.&nbsp;<br> Whether it was getting to hug cousins I hadn&#x2019;t seen since we were kids, hearing stories about my grandparents&#x2019; wedding from guests who had been there that day, or eating homemade pies rolled out with a pin that had been a hand-carved wedding gift fifty years earlier&#x2014;the meal made me smile. It was a most memorable meal.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that&#x2019;s what <i>The Homesick Texan&#x2019;s Family Table</i> is all about&#x2014;making memories at the table with those whom we love. No matter if they are memories of sitting together for a simple weeknight dinner or jostling for space during a large holiday gathering, some of my fondest moments have occurred at the family table. Perhaps you feel the same way.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure, Texans spend time at the table for the major milestones such as births, weddings, anniversaries, and deaths. But we&#x2019;re also inclined to break bread together just because it&#x2019;s a clear evening, and our friend&#x2019;s back porch has a spectacular view of the sunset, or it&#x2019;s a Sunday afternoon in spring, and we want to toast the arrival of our state flower, the bluebonnet. No special occasion is ever really needed: Texans gather at the table simply to reconnect with our family and friends.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is not to say that food isn&#x2019;t also important. On the contrary, we love to eat and we love to eat well. And what we eat plays such an important role in our lives, if you&#x2019;re a homesick Texan such as myself, you&#x2019;ll find that cooking and eating certain dishes will instantly take you back home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, on cold winter nights I&#x2019;ll brighten people&#x2019;s spirits with ranch-style beans and jalape�o cheese enchiladas. Or to commemorate Texas Independence Day, I might offer bowls of chili and slices of pecan pie. Fiery wings, peppery ribs, and choriqueso are always welcome before the big game. And when the world begins to awaken in spring, thick slices of balsamic-tarragon glazed ham along with strawberry shortcakes are a fine way to celebrate the world in bloom.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The recipes I&#x2019;m sharing with you are inspired by old favorites that I culled from recipe cards, dinners, and conversations with family and friends across the state, dishes that are as wide and varied as Texas itself. Whether it&#x2019;s seafood from the Coastal Bend, beef dishes from the arid west, Mexican-influenced dishes from the Rio Grande Valley, or traditionally Southern dishes from the east&#x2014;Texas&#x2019;s food reflects the diversity of its regions and people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#x2019;re familiar with my first book and my blog, you might be aware that I have been known to take certain liberties with Texas cuisine. For instance, I tend to eschew processed and packaged ingredients in favor of their fresh equivalents. I also try to cook with fruits and vegetables that are in season as much as possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simply put, my approach to cooking is to make each dish as flavorful as possible. This can be achieved, for example, by using fresh ingredients, by adding an extra squeeze of lime juice, or by throwing in a jalape�o slice or two. But while I may tweak the classics and create new dishes from old standards, their spirit and soul is always Texan.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But enough about the book&#x2014;let&#x2019;s get cooking. Please pull up a chair and join me at the table, where&#x2019;s there&#x2019;s plenty of mighty fine food, and mighty fine people to eat it.</p><h2>On the Night You Were Born</h2><p><p>On the night you were born, you brought wonder and magic to the world.

Dragging herself out of bed on a frigid Minnesota morning for exercise, of all things, is bad enough. Discovering the body of man-eating bombshell Ronni Ward floating in the gym's jacuzzi? Okay, that's worse. Nor does it help that there's a plate of The Cookie Jar's very own cream puffs garnishing the murder scene.<br><br>Trying to narrow the list of Ronni's enemies down to fewer than half the town's female population, Hannah has her plate full.

That time has come in this eleventh entertaining cozy featuring the cookie baker: she must go on a diet. Hannah starts working out at a health club and vows to stop tasting the scrumptious treats she prepares every day for the Cookie Jar bakery in Lake Eden, Minnesota. Stress mounts when Hannah discovers the body of a fitness instructor floating in her club&#x2019;s Jacuzzi. The acerbic trainer was universally loathed by women and liked by most men (including the staff of the local police department) for her flirtatious ways. In a reversal of the usual procedure, this time one of Hannah&#x2019;s boyfriends, Detective Mike Kingston, recruits her help in solving the mystery, as he and his fellow cops are potential suspects. Hannah and her other boyfriend, dentist Norman, go to work to solve the mystery with dubious and conflicting suggestions from all of the real detectives. As usual, Fluke intersperses delectable recipes and reveals plenty of new personal details about her eccentric and likable cast of characters. --Judy Coon</p><h2>What Is Real?: The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics</h2><p><b>"A thorough, illuminating exploration of the most consequential controversy raging in modern science." --<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br>Every physicist agrees quantum mechanics is among humanity's finest scientific achievements. But ask what it means, and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have followed Niels Bohr's solipsistic and poorly reasoned Copenhagen interpretation. Indeed, questioning it has long meant professional ruin, yet some daring physicists, such as John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett, persisted in seeking the true meaning of quantum mechanics. <i>What Is Real?</i> is the gripping story of this battle of ideas and the courageous scientists who dared to stand up for truth.<br>"An excellent, accessible account." --<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"Splendid. . . .

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country."--Edward Bernays, <em>Propaganda</em></p><p>A seminal and controversial figure in the history of political thought and public relations, Edward Bernays (1891-1995), pioneered the scientific technique of shaping and manipulating public opinion, which he famously dubbed "engineering of consent." During World War I, he was an integral part of the U.S. Committee on Public Information (CPI), a powerful propaganda apparatus that was mobilized to package, advertise and sell the war to the American people as one that would "Make the World Safe for Democracy." The CPI would become the blueprint in which marketing strategies for future wars would be based upon.</p><p>Bernays applied the techniques he had learned in the CPI and, incorporating some of the ideas of Walter Lipmann, became an outspoken proponent of propaganda as a tool for democratic and corporate manipulation of the population. His 1928 bombshell <em>Propaganda</em> lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science and education. To read this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regards to organized manipulation of the masses.</p></p><p></p><h2>On Love and Barley: Haiku of Basho (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Basho, one of the greatest of Japanese poets and the master of haiku, was also a Buddhist monk and a life-long traveller. His poems combine 'karumi', or lightness of touch, with the Zen ideal of oneness with creation. Each poem evokes the natural world - the cherry blossom, the leaping frog, the summer moon or the winter snow - suggesting the smallness of human life in comparison to the vastness and drama of nature. Basho himself enjoyed solitude and a life free from possessions, and his haiku are the work of an observant eye and a meditative mind, uncluttered by materialism and alive to the beauty of the world around him.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

A poet and diarist, he spent his youth as companion to the son of the local lord, and with him studied the writing of poetry. In 1667 he moved to Edo (now Tokyo) and continued to write verse. Eventually, he became a recluse. His writings are strongly influenced by the Zen sect of Buddhism.

After the rise of the Nazis, she emigrated to America where she proceeded to write some of the most searching, hard-hitting reflections on the agonizing issues of the time: totalitarianism in both Nazi and Stalinist garb; Zionism and the legacy of the Holocaust; federally mandated school desegregation and civil rights in the United States; and the nature of evil.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Portable Hannah Arendt</i> offers substantial excerpts from the three works that ensured her international and enduring stature: <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, <i>The Human Condition</i>, and <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>. Additionally, this volume includes several other provocative essays, as well as her correspondence with other influential figures.</p><p>Peter Baehr's anthology is a gem made up of 33 selections supplemented by his highly competent introduction, a chronology covering the major events in Hannah Arendt's life, and a basic bibliography. Arendt's erudition and incisive brilliance are well represented throughout. Passages include lengthy excerpts from her major books ( <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, <i>The Human Condition</i>, <i>On Revolution</i>, and <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>), shorter excerpts from <i>Rahel Varnhagen</i> and <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, eight essays (four from <i>Between Past and Future</i>, one from <i>Men in Dark Times</i>, and two not previously available in book form), a University of Chicago lecture, her famous television interview with Guenter Gaus, four letters (two to Karl Jaspers, others to Mary McCarthy and Gershom Scholem), and a brief journal entry (on Heidegger "the fox"). Ever sensitive to the limitations of anthologies, particularly for the work of thinkers like Arendt, Baehr has managed to effectively convey the feel of Arendt's conscientious yet combative thinking through his selections and arrangements. <p> Arendt burst upon the world literary stage in 1951 with <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> and a <i>Saturday Review</i> cover photo. She understood totalitarianism as an unprecedented phenomenon, identifying several elements that fused into it and analyzing totalitarian movements and rule. The success of <i>Origins</i> led to prestigious lectureships and 25 years of fiercely independent writing and teaching. She proved knowledgeable about philosophy as well as history and politics, fluent not only in English and German (her beloved "mother tongue") but also in French, Greek, and Latin. This precocious German Jewess had devoted her college years to studying philosophy, theology, and Greek (with Heidegger, Jaspers, Husserl, and Bultmann!), but the Nazi rise to power compelled Arendt to focus on politics, especially the Jewish question. From the '50s until her death in 1975, Arendt developed and publicly defended controversial views, including her report on the Eichmann trial and her coinage "the banality of evil"; her opposition to integrationist busing and to affirmative action hiring in universities; and her version of (classical) republicanism, rooted in her radical understandings of human action and the dignity of politics. All these views and more find expression in this collection. Of late, Arendt's fame has been rekindled by revelations of her love affair with Heidegger. Now, as we approach her birth centenary (2006), this Portable provides newcomers and faithful admirers alike a marvelous package of Arendt's writings. <i>--Richard Kenney</i></p><p><b>Hannah Arendt</b>&nbsp;(1906&#x2013;1975) was University Professor of political philosophy in the graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, a visiting professor at several universities including California, Princeton, Columbia, and Chicago, a research director of the Conference on Jewish Relations, the chief editor of Schocken Books, and the executive director of Jewish Cultural Reconstruction in New York City.

That's the vision of Proverbs 11:10, in which the <em>tsaddiqim</em>&#x2015;the people who see everything they have as gifts from God to be stewarded for his purposes&#x2015;pursue their vocation with an eye to the greater good. Amy Sherman, director of the Center on Faith in Communities and scholar of vocational stewardship, uses the <em>tsaddiqim</em> as a springboard to explore how, through our faith-formed calling, we announce the kingdom of God to our everyday world. But cultural trends toward privatism and materialism threaten to dis-integrate our faith and our work. And the church, in ways large and small, has itself capitulated to those trends, while simultaneously elevating the "special calling" of professional ministry and neglecting the vocational formation of laypeople. In the process, we have, in ways large and small, subverted our kingdom mandate. God is on the move, and he calls each of us, from our various halls of power and privilege, to follow him. Here is your chance, keeping this kingdom calling in view, to steward your faith and work toward righteousness. In so doing, you will bless the world, and as you flourish, the world will celebrate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Amy L. Sherman</strong> is a senior fellow at the Sagamore Institute, where she directs the Center on Faith in Communities. She also serves as a senior fellow with the International Justice Mission."This book is a must read for pastors and church leaders to equip and empower their congregations into a 'Kingdom calling.'" (Jason Bachman, Enrichment, Summer 2012)<br><br>"Amy Sherman is a timely and compelling voice to the church. . . . <em>Kingdom Calling</em> is a very helpful read for pastors and ministry leaders who desire to learn specific and tangible ways on becoming more intentional in equipping congregational members for being a faithful presence for Christ in the world through their vocations." (Tom Nelson, senior pastor of Christ Community Church in Leawood, Kansas, and author of Work Matters)<br><br>"Amy Sherman's carefully researched and theologically grounded work will serve as an inspiration and resource for churches needing to discover and deploy the passions and gifts of their people to faithfully serve the world outside the church. While targeted at pastors and church leaders, this book is also accessible and encouraging for the average congregant who has come to desire a more robust integration of faith and work, which extends from 'blooming where planted' to leading change initiatives within their existing workplaces and by starting new entrepreneurial ventures. <em>Kingdom Calling</em> captures and adds to the equipping and mobilizing 'how-to' we have discovered at Redeemer and would love to share with churches around the world." (Katherine Leary Alsdorf, founder and executive director, Center for Faith Work, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City)<br><br>"Filled with careful research, inspiring examples, heroic people and epic stories, <em>Kingdom Calling </em>introduces the reader to the reality that William Gibson identified: 'The future is already here; it's just not evenly distributed.' This book will go a long way in helping us fast-forward that future." (Eric Swanson, Leadership Community Director for Externally Focused Churches, Leadership Network, and author of To Transform a City)<br><br>"It has been my experience that very few believers deal with one of the most significant issues of the Christian life: the relationship between what they do vocationally and what they are called to do by our Lord and Savior. It is impossible to live as a kingdom servant without considering your kingdom calling. Amy Sherman has articulated extremely well the theological foundation of a kingdom calling and then shown how to practically exercise that calling. It is a privilege for me to endorse this book wholeheartedly as a book that is not only well written, but more importantly one of immense importance." (Ron Blue, president of Kingdom Advisors)<br><br>"To me, this book is at the core of what kingdom living and engagement are all about. When the church in the West gets this, we are going to see transformation on an unimaginable scale. Solid theology, good stories and lots of practical application." (Bob Roberts Jr., senior pastor, NorthWood Church, and author of Real-Time Connections and Transformation)</p><h2>Why Leaders Lie: The Truth About Lying in International Politics</h2><p>For more than two decades, John J. Mearsheimer has been regarded as one of the foremost realist thinkers on foreign policy. Clear and incisive, a fearlessly honest analyst, his coauthored 2007 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy</em>, aroused a firestorm with its unflinching look at the making of America's Middle East policy. Now he takes a look at another controversial but understudied aspect of international relations: lying.<br><br>In <em>Why Leaders Lie</em>, Mearsheimer provides the first systematic analysis of lying as a tool of statecraft, identifying the varieties, the reasons, and the potential costs and benefits. Drawing on a trove of examples, he argues that leaders often lie for good strategic reasons, so a blanket condemnation is unrealistic and unwise. Yet there are other kinds of deception besides lying, including concealment and spinning. Perhaps no distinction is more important than that between lying to another state and lying to one's own people. Mearsheimer was amazed to discover how unusual interstate lying has been; given the atmosphere of distrust among the great powers, he found that outright deceit is difficult to pull off and thus rarely worth the effort. Plus it sometimes backfires when it does occur. Khrushchev lied about the size of the Soviet missile force, sparking an American build-up. Eisenhower got caught lying about U-2 spy flights in 1960, which scuttled an upcoming summit with Krushchev. Leaders more often mislead their own publics, sometimes with damaging consequences. Though the reasons may be noble--Franklin Roosevelt, for example, lied to the American people about German U-boats attacking the destroyer Greer in 1940, to build a case for war against Hitler-they can easily lead to disaster, as with the Bush administration's falsehoods about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. <br><br>There has never been a sharp analysis of international lying. Now a leading expert fills the gap with a richly informed and powerfully argued book.<br></p><p><br><strong>John J. Mearsheimer</strong> is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science and the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago. His books include <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, which won the Joseph Lepgold Book Prize, and <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy</em>, which has been translated into twenty-one languages.<br><br>Acclaim for <em>Why Leaders Lie</em>: <br><p></p><br>"Entertaining and well-written...this is a short and punchy book with a lot of lists and observations.... On its own terms, this book is an attempt to start a conversation about how lying operates in international politics. In that respect, it succeeds admirably, and contains a number of important avenues for future research." <br>--<em>International Affairs</em> <br><p></p><br>"Mearsheimer is one of the most prominent, productive and imaginative scholars in the realist school of international relations. In this brief, highly instructive volume he discusses how and why leaders have used deception, dissembling and outright lying in pursuit of foreign policy goals." <br>--<em>The RUSI Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Myth-makers beware! Writing with verve and economy, John Mearsheimer breaks new ground in exposing this hot-button issue to systematic scrutiny." <br>--Jack Snyder, Professor of International Relations, Columbia University <br><p></p><br>"Is lying in international politics a shameful behavior or a useful tool of statecraft? When is it good for leaders to lie to their own people? Is there too much--or too little--lying in international politics? John Mearsheimer answers these and other similarly explosive questions with the boldness and originality for which he is so well known. This is an insightful essay by one of the world's most provocative thinkers. A fascinating read." <br>--Mois�s Na�m, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and former Editor-in-Chief, <em>Foreign Policy</em> <br><p></p><br>"This path-breaking study of lying in international politics is full of surprises. World leaders can lie to each other without suffering grave consequences, but they do it far less often than we might suppose. However, when leaders lie to their own publics about foreign policy conduct, significant damage can result--particularly in democracies. John Mearsheimer categorizes the various types of lies and weighs the risks of undertaking them in this insightful analysis that is so relevant to our times." <br>--James F. Hoge, Jr., Chairman, Human Rights Watch, and former Editor, <em>Foreign Affairs</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this fascinating little book, John J. Mearsheimer argues that lying about foreign policy is an intrinsic part of the democratic way of life. This is an important message for those members of democratic publics who wish to avoid being bamboozled by their leaders." <br>--Robert O.

Young German women are expected to do their duty&#x2014;working for the Reich or marrying to produce strong, healthy children. After an interview with the civil service, Magda is assigned to the Berghof, Hitler&#x2019;s mountain retreat. Only after weeks of training does she learn her assignment: she will be one of several young women tasting the F�hrer&#x2019;s food, offering herself in sacrifice to keep him from being poisoned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perched high in the Bavarian Alps, the Berghof seems worlds away from the realities of battle. Though terrified at first, Magda gradually becomes used to her dangerous occupation&#x2014;though she knows better than to voice her misgivings about the war. But her love for a conspirator within the SS, and her growing awareness of the Reich&#x2019;s atrocities, draw Magda into a plot that will test her wits and loyalty in a quest for safety, freedom, and ultimately, vengeance.&nbsp; <br><br> Vividly written and ambitious in scope, <i>The Taster</i> examines the harrowing moral dilemmas of war in an emotional story filled with acts of extraordinary courage.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for V.S.

The successful Mississippi oilman's college affair with Mallory Candler ended long before she was killed, but the mysterious Eve knows things about that affair that only Mallory could have known. That's more than a coincidence, since Eve is actually Mallory's reincarnation&#x2014;or, at least, she's the corporeal body into which Mallory's restless soul seems to have migrated. Long before the bizarre denouement of this supernatural thriller--a departure for Iles, whose previous thrillers have been much more straightforward--the reader's sympathies have been engaged by Waters, a decent man whose best friend may be his worst enemy and whose past may destroy his future.

These sharks were the alphas among alphas, some longer than twenty feet, and there were too many to count; even more incredible, this congregation was taking place just twenty-seven miles off the coast of San Francisco.</p><p>In a matter of months, Casey was being hoisted out of the early-winter swells on a crane, up a cliff face to the barren surface of Southeast Farallon Island-dubbed by sailors in the 1850s the "devil's teeth." There she joined Scot Anderson and Peter Pyle, the two biologists who bunk down during shark season each fall in the island's one habitable building, a haunted, 135-year-old house spackled with lichen and gull guano. Two days later, she got her first glimpse of the famous, terrifying jaws up close and she was instantly hooked; her fascination soon yielded to obsession-and an invitation to return for a full season. But as Casey readied herself for the eight-week stint, she had no way of preparing for what she would find among the dangerous, forgotten islands that have banished every campaign for civilization in the past two hundred years. </p><p><i>The Devil's Teeth</i> is a vivid dispatch from an otherworldly outpost, a story of crossing the boundary between society and an untamed place where humans are neither wanted nor needed.</p></p><p>In a post-<i>Jaws</i>/Discovery Channel world, unearthing fresh data on great white sharks is a feat. So credit Susan Casey not just with finding and spotlighting two biologists who have done truly pioneering field research on the beasts but also with following them and their subjects into the heart of one of the most unnatural habitats on Earth: the Farallon Islands. Though just 30 miles due west of San Francisco, the Farallones--nicknamed the Devil's Teeth for their ragged appearance and raging inhospitality--are utterly alien, which may explain why each autumn, packs of great whites return to gorge on the seals and sea lions that gather there before returning to the Pacific and beyond. That Casey, via her biologist buddies Peter Pyle and Scot Anderson, can even report that sharks apparently follow migratory feeding patterns is a revelation. Throughout <i>The Devil's Teeth</i>, Casey makes clear that year upon year of observing the sharks have given Pyle and Anderson (and by extension, us) insights into shark behavior that are entirely new and too numerous to list. The otherworldly Farallon Islands, meanwhile, also dominate Casey's engaging tale as she charts their transformation from ultradangerous source of wild eggs in the 19th century to ultradangerous real-life shark lab and bird sanctuary today. Despite the plethora of factoids on offer, Casey's style is consistently digestible and very amusing. She also has a knack for putting things into perspective. Take this characteristic passage: <blockquote>The Farallon great whites are largely unharassed. They might cross paths with the occasional boatload of day-trippers from San Francisco, but they're subjected to none of the behavior-altering coercion that nature's top predators regularly endure so that people can sit in the Winnebago... and get a look at them. This is important because despite their visibility at the Farallones, and despite the impressive truth that sharks are so old they predate <i>trees</i>, great whites have remained among the most mysterious of creatures."</blockquote> By book's end, it's hard to know what's more captivating: The biologists' groundbreaking data, Casey's primer on the evolution of the Farallones, the islands' symbiotic relationships with the sharks, the gulls and sea lions they attract, or the outpost's resident ghosts. Frankly, it's a nice problem to have. <i>--Kim Hughes</i> <p> <strong>Getting to Know the Great White</strong> </p><p> It was a BBC documentary on great white sharks visiting California's Farallon Islands that turned Susan Casey from an editor of adventure and outdoors stories in such magazines as <i>Outside</i> to a journalist obsessed with an outdoors adventure of her own. In her Amazon.com interview, Casey recalls the fascinations and the follies of her time with the sharks in the Farallones and discusses everything from the ethics of adventure journalism to the stunning silence and size of nature's perfect predators. And in her answers to the Significant Seven (the seven questions we like to ask every author), she reveals her admiration for both Joseph Mitchell and Johnny Knoxville (once you've read her book, both choices seem appropriate). </p><p> <strong></strong> </p><table> </table><table> <tbody><tr> <td><br> The outer edge of the fearsome Maintop Bay, a spooky, boat-eating stretch of water that makes everyone uneasy.

Author Patty Loew focuses on oral tradition&#x2014;stories, songs, the recorded words of Indian treaty negotiators, and interviews&#x2014;along with other untapped Native sources, such as tribal newspapers, to present a distinctly different view of history.

Through humorous, empowering, and touching portraits of twenty-four spiritual mentors who inspired her, Johnson shows how their bravery, integrity, selflessness, perseverance, and hope helped her and can help others have courage to reach for a closer connection to God.<br><br>She presents remarkable holy women and saints--including the gun-toting Servant of God Sr. Blandina Segale who tried to turn the heart of Billy the Kid, and Nazi resister Irena Sendler who helped smuggle children out of the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II--in a way that brings their vivid personalities to life and helps readers live out the challenges of their lives with virtue and conviction.

Johnson is a composition and literature professor at George Piedmont Technical College and has received a number of awards for teaching."Johnson, host of the popular podcast <i>Catholic Weekend</i> and blogger at <i>CatholicMom.com</i>, offers readers an exploration of inspiring women past and present who challenged the status quo, served Christ wholeheartedly, and continue to inspire women today. She blends her own story with those of courageous women who became saints, who will likely become saints, and who arguably ought to be saints. She explores such virtues as courage through the lives of WWII spy Nancy Wake and St. Joan of Arc; perseverance through author Flannery O'Connor and St. Margaret of Antioch; peace via Immaculee Ilibagiza and St. Rita of Cascia; and virtue through the most virtuous of all, the Blessed Virgin Mary. Every story challenges, informs, and encourages as Johnson interweaves discussions about how we can live and thrive similarly to these women today. Chapters end with questions and an action step; the book ends with a six-week guide for further study. Catholics--and women everywhere--will find something to love."

Her entertaining list of modern women of faith and their saintly counterparts exhorts women toward sainthood and says, 'Yes, this can be you, too, if you want it.' It's the wanting, after all--the pursuit of sainthood despite obstacles malicious or well-meant--that brings out the badass fearless trust that hones a saint." --<b>Elizabeth Scalia</b>, Catholic blogger and author of <i>Strange Gods</i><br><br>"Each of us has an opportunity to be a beacon of hope to those around us.

Ogden Nash first gathered together an anthology of thirty years of his published works in 1959.

Now more poems have come to light, so his daughters have once again produced <i>The Best of Ogden Nash</i>, the definitive Nash anthology. The poems display the talent of the man whose verse entranced America from the time of the Great Depression until his death in 1971. <i>The Best of Ogden Nash</i> should delight old fans and introduce new readers to a unique talent.</p><p>Ogden Nash is the best-loved poet of light verse in the United States.

His rhymes were not merely amusing but often revelatory....[His] legacy remains a vital part of twentieth-century American poetry.

Ramiel Nagel&#x2019;s bestselling guide, <em>Cure Tooth Decay</em>, has inspired tens of thousands of readers to discover hidden and effective means to reduce dental cavities by at least 90 percent. In <em>Cure Gum Disease Naturally</em>, Nagel expands upon his original work and shows you the forgotten and suppressed cure for gum disease. </p> <p>The CDC now reports that about half of all adult Americans suffer from periodontal disease, with 8.5 percent of all adults having severe gum disease. And even worse, 23 percent of all adults aged sixty-five and older have lost all of their teeth. Despite the prevalence of periodontal disease, dentistry has not found the &#x201c;cure&#x201d; as it continues to allow adults to lose their teeth only to primarily offer the expensive and often painful alternative of dental implants.</p> <p>This is not a book that advocates for gum surgery, or for other chemical or harsh overpriced treatments with dubious results. This is a truly natural, holistic approach that primarily focuses on how you can use the food that you eat as medicine for your body, to give it specific and targeted nutrition, and to make your sad gums happy again. It will show you how to turn the frequent dreadful dental visits into a delight, and to help you stop worrying about the health of your teeth and gums so you can start living life&#x2014;as you deserve to&#x2014;once again. Take a bite out of life, improve how you feel, reduce your level of stress, and finally, at last, read a book that was truly written with a goal that you can align with, to get you out of the endless and unnecessary cycle of gum disease treatments that do not provide results that last because they never address the root cause.</p> <p><em>Cure Gum Disease Naturally</em> is about you and your health. It begins with the story of how conventional dentistry no longer advocates and prescribes treatments based upon the agreed upon and proven cause of gum disease. You will learn how enlightened dentists Melvin Page and Harold Hawkins applied the research of esteemed dentist Weston Price in their practices to prevent the tragic loss of teeth by restoring gum health in their patients. You will then be led, step by step, through the evidence and the information that gives you a precise and detailed road map, using whole foods, to stop gum disease and to rebuild and repair your gums. Finally, you will be given essential information to navigate the dangerous waters of gum treatments, and find new ways to care for your teeth and gums that until now, few knew were even possible.</p> <p>Read <em>Cure Gum Disease Naturally</em> and learn how loose teeth can be firmed up and become rooted like a strong tree once again into your jaw bone, inflamed gums can become healthy, and bleeding can be greatly reduced and stopped. You will at last see clearly why you have succumbed to gum disease and know specific steps to take, by eating certain foods, to keep your gums healthy and thus keep your teeth for the rest of your life.</p></p><p>Ramiel Nagel is the author of "Cure Tooth Decay" and "Healing Our Children."

Danenberg, DDS</b><br> Periodontist of forty-one years</p> <p>"Ramiel takes a sincere and critical look at how gum disease is treated in the U.S. today. Or should I say, how gum disease is mistreated? I think it is an injustice not to inform patients that there are nutritional solutions that prevent gum disease, which is a type of chronic disease. This is a book you must read...

This revised edition also contains a new chapter on preventive maintenance plus a resource guide. <br><br> Throughout the book, Nash balances an abiding love of old houses with a common-sense understanding of modern-day needs. Whether you already live in an older home or are contemplating buying one, this hearty book gives you detailed, professional-level information you can't find elsewhere.</p></p><p>Nash is a renovation contractor and fencebuilding enthusiast.This is a reincarnation of Nash's out-of-print classic, Old House: A Rebuilder's Manual ( LJ 1/15/80), substantially rewritten and reorganized. The focus is the major defects of old houses: the heaved foundation walls, defunct mechanical systems, rotted structural timbers, damaged roofs, and broken staircases. Nash is both an artful writer and a knowledgeable renovation specialist. He writes with poetic grace about the unique character and hidden beauty of old houses, yet he's remarkably clearheaded and resourceful when dealing with their often maddening irregularities. There isn't a better sourcebook on the larger structural challenges of renovation.

Mignolo and Catherine E. Walsh explore the hidden forces of the colonial matrix of power, its origination, transformation, and current presence, while asking the crucial questions of decoloniality's how, what, why, with whom, and what for. Interweaving theory-praxis with local histories and perspectives of struggle, they illustrate the conceptual and analytic dynamism of decolonial ways of living and thinking, as well as the creative force of resistance and re-existence. This book speaks to the urgency of these times, encourages delinkings from the colonial matrix of power and its "universals" of Western modernity and global capitalism, and engages with arguments and struggles for dignity and life against death, destruction, and civilizational despair.</p><p>Walter D.

For several summers Muriel, her children, and the family dog set off in a twenty-five foot motorboat, the Caprice, to explore the waters between Vancouver Island and the rugged Canadian mainland. They were on their own, with Muriel as captain, anchoring in secluded coves to tramp the wilderness, examining architecture and burial grounds in deserted native villages, and meeting the region's various human and animal inhabitants. </p><p> Muriel wrote about their journeys, and was successful in having articles published in magazines such as <i>Blackwood's</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. In 1962, the year Muriel died, Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh, Scotland published <i>The Curve in Time</i>, which described several summers of the family explorations. In 1968, Gray Publishing in Canada printed a second edition of <i>The Curve in Time</i>, and since then it has earned a reputation as a Canadian classic. </p></p><h2>The Sonnets and a Lover&#39;s Complaint (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Part of Penguin&#39;s beautiful hardback Clothbound Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design. When this volume of Shakespeare&#39;s poems first appeared in 1609, he had already written most of the great plays that made him famous. The 154 sonnets - all but two of which are addressed to a beautiful young man or a treacherous &#39;dark lady&#39; - contain some of the most exquisite and haunting poetry ever written, and deal with eternal subjects such as love and infidelity, memory and mortality, and the destruction wreaked by Time. Also included is A Lover&#39;s Complaint, originally published with the sonnets, in which a young woman is overheard lamenting her betrayal by a heartless seducer.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright of the 16th and 17 centuries, now widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the word&#39;s pre-eminent dramatist.</p><h2>The Lobster Coast: Rebels, Rusticators, and the Struggle for a Forgotten Frontier</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A thorough and engaging history of Maine&#x2019;s rocky coast and its tough-minded people.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Boston Herald</i></b><br><br><b>&#x201c;[A] well-researched and well-written cultural and ecological history of stubborn perseverance.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;USA Today</i></b><br><br>For more than four hundred years the people of coastal Maine have clung to their rocky, wind-swept lands, resisting outsiders&#x2019; attempts to control them while harvesting the astonishing bounty of the Gulf of Maine. Today&#x2019;s independent, self-sufficient lobstermen belong to the communities imbued with a European sense of ties between land and people, but threatened by the forces of homogenization spreading up the eastern seaboard.<p>In the tradition of William Warner&#x2019;s <i>Beautiful Swimmers</i>, veteran journalist Colin Woodard (author of&nbsp;<i>American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good</i>) traces the history of the rugged fishing communities that dot the coast of Maine and the prized crustacean that has long provided their livelihood.

A handful of islanders gather in the small aft cabin, warming themselves by the tiny black stove, while their groceries and shopping bags chill on the deck alongside rows of propane tanks and other large island-bound parcels. Mailbags rest in the starboard cubbyhole, protected from the elements, which can be extremely assertive during the fourteen-mile crossing from the mainland. From November to April, the Laura B. is the only link to the mainland for Monhegan's sixty year-round residents, making the round-trip journey from the tiny fishing town of Port Clyde only three times a week.<p>But on this last day of November, the Laura B. is packed with people. There are nearly as many people on board as live on the island this time of year, most of them mainlanders on their way out to help friends and family prepare for the most important day of Monhegan's year. Tomorrow, December 1, is Trap Day, the day Monhegan's lobstermen begin their unique, winter- only lobster season.</p><p>At a time of year when most of Maine's seven thousand lobster- men have hauled up their traps and brought their boats around to secure winter anchorages, Monhegan's fourteen lobstermen are getting ready to set their traps for the first time since spring. Once the fishermen have set their traps, they'll continue fishing through the dead of winter, braving ferocious weather and subzero temperatures that often leave their twenty-eight- to forty- foot boats encased in frozen spray. The lobstermen can handle this with the help of a sternman or two, but on Trap Day they need all the help they can get moving their heavy traps down to the town wharf. There are only twenty aging, beat-up pickups on the island, but each lobsterman needs to get a gang of six hundred traps, weighted metal cages weighing forty to fifty pounds apiece, out of their backyard, down the hill, and stacked up on the town wharf where they can be loaded onto the lobster boat. It can't be done much beforehand because the island's 8,400 traps can't fit on the granite wharf. Even if they did fit, they'd make offloading the Laura B. next to impossible. So, just before Trap Day, the entire village and dozens of mainlanders turn out to move the traps in the maritime equivalent of a barn-raising ceremony.</p><p>I'm on my way out to help Zoe Zanidakis, the island's only female lobster boat captain and onetime proprietor of the Monhegan House, one of the island's three summer inns. But there's a problem. About two months ago, Zoe quit answering her phone. She stopped picking up her cell phone and left e-mail and answering machine messages unreturned. It was as if Zoe had dropped off the face of the earth. After failing to track her down through several mutual acquaintances&#x2014; nobody seemed to know where she was&#x2014;I decided to board Laura B. as planned and track her down on the island. After all, no Monhegan lobsterman would ever miss Trap Day, least of all a ninth-generation islander like Zoe. Monhegan lobstermen make or break their season in the first few weeks of December, harvesting lobsters in an area that has not been fished in six months. But Trap Day has a ritualistic importance that transcends dollars and cents. &#x201c;It's like cleaning the slate,&#x201d; one islander explained to me. &#x201c;We all come together to get the boats ready and any of the crap and hard feelings that have accumulated in the community are wiped away.&#x201d; As we pass Allen Island and begin the final, seven-mile open ocean crossing, I'm certain Zoe is out there on the gray, humplike shape looming on the horizon.</p><p>It's a mild day for Maine in early winter&#x2014;forty-five degrees and almost sunny, with still air and gently swelling seas&#x2014;so many of the passengers spread out on deck, lounging amid the luggage, propane, and building supplies. I join them, and halfway up the port rail I find Billy Payne, who runs one of the island's two small stores. Billy, tanned from a vacation in South Carolina, tells me Zoe is nowhere to be found. &#x201c;They say she's in a movie out in Hollywood,&#x201d; he says, breaking into an understated smile. &#x201c;But nobody seems to know for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>The Laura B. lolls along, unperturbed by the swells. She's nearly sixty years old, and her wooden hull is only sixty-five feet long, but she was built for tougher chores than the Monhegan mail run: running soldiers and ammunition around Pacific bases during the Second World War. Slowly, steadily, Monhegan grows before us, its features becoming more detailed with each passing minute. First the rocky cliffs emerge from their forested crown. Then the forest reveals its inner anatomy of pine, spruce, and fir trees, straight and tall on the island's interior, stunted or dead along the exposed headlands. Guillemots and other cold-loving seabirds flutter over the primeval scene.</p><p>At first only one or two houses are apparent, poking out from the forest like lost children, along with the lighthouse tower, which sticks up from its hilltop like a ship's funnel. But as we round the island's northern tip and head down the western shore, the village slowly reveals itself. A cluster of wood-shingled houses, fish houses, and boat sheds stand on the gentle hillsides facing the shore. There are two hundred all told, but as we approach the harbor it's clear that most of the buildings are boarded up for the winter.</p><p>We slip past the nasty ledges guarding the north entrance and into the harbor, or what passes for one. Monhegan, a sausage-shaped island two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, doesn't have a single deepwater cove or inlet in which one can protect so much as a skiff. All it has is Manana, a small grass-covered hump of rock that protrudes from the sea alongside Monhegan like a whale calf cuddling next to its mother. Monhegan's lobster boats are moored in the narrow passage between the two islands, an anchorage as uncomfortable as it is beautiful. The four-hundred-yard-wide passage is well protected by the tall islands on either side, and the ledges at the narrow north entrance afford reasonable cover from northeasterly winds. But the harbor is completely open to the south, and in a southwesterly storm the seas race through the harbor unimpeded. During particularly fierce winter storms, waves have crashed through low-lying parts of the village, but the lobster boats themselves ride the tempests out on their heavy moorings. We enter the harbor and come alongside the town's heavy granite wharf. Stacks of lobster traps are already growing at the base of the wharf, and one of the town's aging pickups is driving down the dirt road, piled high with more traps to be unloaded. But as we tie up and begin collecting our bags from their pile on the foredeck, the first thing I notice is the camera crew.</p><p>The three-man crew has set up a tripod-mounted camera and a big pole-mounted mike right on the edge of the wharf to film the mail boat's arrival. The height of the tide is such that the camera is pointed right in our faces, and a couple of people pause to stare at it as we head down the gangway. &#x201c;Just move along,&#x201d; one of the cameramen barks, waving us along with a gloved hand. &#x201c;Pretend we're not here.&#x201d; I try but just up the hill from the wharf I encounter a giant boom crane, poised to capture Trap Day action on the wharf. As I stand, gaping, the pickup pulls alongside me.</p><p>I drop my bags and start stacking lobster traps.</p><p>A burly, red-faced man in a flannel shirt has climbed to the top of the truckload of traps, stacked six-high in the same inverted ziggurat pattern farmers use for hay bales, which makes sense since the traps are approximately the same size and weight as a large hay bale. He passes traps down to the four of us on the ground and we carry them, in turn, to the growing stack on the wharf belonging to that particular fisherman. It's not hard to tell which traps go with which stack. Each lobsterman has already rigged his traps, and every second or third trap has a buoy and a coil of rope inside. The distinctive main buoys are painted in the unique color pattern of their owner, in this case white with an orange top and matching orange and white spindle. Later, when the traps are deployed and the buoys are floating on the surface, there will be no confusion as to whose traps are whose. It quickly becomes evident to me that the traps with the buoys in them are much heavier than the others. These &#x201c;headers&#x201d; are the first to be hauled up in the strings of two or three traps used on the island. Often these are more heavily weighted than the other traps in their string, serving as the anchor for the other traps they are attached to, called &#x201c;tailers.&#x201d;</p><p>The truck is empty, and the four people who came down with it jump in the back and start riding up the hill for another load. We haven't yet spoken a word apart from &#x201c;got it&#x201d; or &#x201c;over there.&#x201d; Another truck rolls in, loaded with traps containing fluorescent pink buoys topped with a black ring. The scene repeats itself. By the time the Laura B.'s crew has finished hoisting the heavy cargo onto the wharf with the boat's gantry crane, truckloads of traps are already waiting to be piled up in her landing zone. After an hour or so, the same trucks begin reappearing with fresh loads of traps. The men and women in the respective crews start acknowledging my existence the second or third time around. We shake our introductions with gloved hands. One couple is from Port Clyde and attended Georges Valley High School at the same time I was at a track and basketball rival a few hours to the northwest. Another guy turns out to be from Boothbay and knows my father. As we stack traps I ask if anyone's seen Zoe. I get all sorts of answers.</p><p>&#x201c;Out to help Zoe? Haven't seen her since October,&#x201d; a taciturn sternman tells me. &#x201c;They say she's doing stunt work out in California.&#x201d; A middle-aged resident assures me she's acting in her own movie and that that's why the film crew is here, sleeping in Zoe's house at the top of the hill. &#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; a third islander asserts. &#x201c;She's in Australia with that actor Russell Crowe.&#x201d; After hearing variations of these and other stories throughout the day, I feel like I've stepped into a novel cowritten by the ghosts of Franz Kafka and the Bront� sisters.</p><p>After a teal and white truck comes down to the wharf for the third time, the driver introduces himself. He turns out to be my host, John Murdock, a lobsterman in his mid-forties who also runs one of two year-round bed and breakfasts on the island. &#x201c;Colin!&#x201d; John laughs. &#x201c;Was wondering where you were. Welcome to Monhegan! When we get this unloaded, toss your bags in and we'll show you your room.&#x201d; Fifteen minutes later I'm in the back, bouncing up the hill with a couple of John's friends.</p><p>We pass the imposing Island Inn, its windows boarded up for the winter and a film crew on the lawn, round a corner at the crossroads, and pull up in front of John's rambling house. John's wife, Winnie, shows me to my room, where I dump my bags and change footwear before heading around back to where John's traps have been stacked all summer, waiting for this day. A second stack belongs to his nineteen-year-old son, Ben, who has his own friends out on the island helping. But Ben has been distracted by a problem with his boat's engine, and most of his six hundred traps are still sitting in the backyard. Half of John's stack has already been moved down to the wharf.</p><p>By early evening, the wharf is stacked so high with traps that no more can be safely added. A narrow passage to the wharf's boat ramp passes between the fifteen-foot-high towers of green-, black-, or yellow-coated metal traps. A few boats come alongside and take on twenty or thirty traps for the first run, scheduled for the following morning. After that, the wharf grows quiet as most islanders turn in early in preparation for the manic day ahead.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>The next morning I awaken to the news that Trap Day, like so many Maine winter events, has been postponed by Mother Nature. It had been blowing at thirty miles an hour from the southwest for much of the night. It was quiet now, but the wind had driven a heavy swell into the unprotected mouth of the harbor that would make loading traps from the wharf more difficult than it was worth. Monhegan's lobstermen, who make all-important decisions collectively down at the Stanley fish house, had decided to hold off for a few hours. They were meeting again at eleven to decide if they would go out in the afternoon.</p><p>It's an unseasonably warm fifty-five degrees, and the road down to the wharf is turning muddy, with pools of water accumulating in the ruts left by the town's little fleet of trucks. All that warm air hanging over the forty-degree water has created another hazard. A pea soup fog is flowing slowly over the village, whose clapboard houses drift in and out of the gray mist. Despite the towering piles of traps, I can't see the wharf until I'm almost standing on it. Inside the traps, the fluorescent paint on the buoys glows as it refracts in the swirling fog. I walk through the narrow canyon between the traps and peer out to sea. I see only two of the fourteen lobster boats in the harbor, their sterns piled high with traps. Manana, just two hundred yards away, is completely invisible, though the foghorn on her far side cries out plaintively from time to time. Big swells crash into the wharf's granite blocks every few seconds, and their splash sizzles on the ocean surface like bacon in a frying pan.</p><p>There's no breakfast place on Monhegan this time of year, but there's fresh coffee down at Billy Payne's store. Billy isn't there when I come in, but he's left a pad of receipts on the counter for patrons to fill out. Some have weighted theirs down with little piles of change and banknotes. Rita White, an elderly lady who once managed not to visit the mainland for seven years, is playing solitaire at one of the store's little booths, and a couple of lobstermen are shooting the shit by the coffee thermoses. Somebody's collie is napping on the floor. I greet people good morning, which seems to take everyone but the dog aback, as if they have gotten out of practice since the summer people went away. Rita sizes me up at a glance. As is often the case in Maine, I'm not sure if I've passed inspection, but she nods assent to my sitting opposite her to drink my coffee.</p><p>The lobstermen are speculating on the result of the upcoming fish house meeting, and there's general agreement that the swells won't die down before nightfall. Problem is, tomorrow is Sunday, and a few of the captains observe the Lord's day of rest. Traditionally, Monheganers don't start their season until everyone is ready. If somebody has engine trouble or a sick relative ashore, fishing is postponed until they can start too. But a number of years back, the fishermen by the coffee thermoses recall, the majority decided to start the season on a Sunday, and some of the older fishermen watched them leave from the beach. &#x201c;Didn't do relations much good on the harbor for a time,&#x201d; one recalls.</p><p>As if on cue, pastor Ted Hoskins comes into the store.

The Cambridge History of Warfare is a comprehensive account of war in the West. The combined effort of seven leading experts, this book treats the history of all aspects of the subject: the development of warfare on land, seas, and air; weapons and technology; strategy and defense; discipline and intelligence; mercenaries and standing armies; cavalry and infantry; chivalry and blitzkreig; guerrilla assault and nuclear warfare. It places in context particular key elements in the history of armed engagement, from the Greek victory at Marathon, through the advent of gunpower in medieval England and France, to the jungle warfare of Vietnam and the strategic air strikes of the Gulf War. Throughout, there is an emphasis on the socio-economic aspects of military progress and how these help explain the rise of the West over the past two millenia to global military dominance.</p><p>War is a compelling subject. It is common to almost all known societies and periods of history. The Cambridge History of Warfare provides a detailed account of war in the West from antiquity to the present day, and is unique because of its controversial thesis that war in western societies has followed a unique path leading to western dominance of the globe.

It will be my seventh garden, and I&#x2019;ve been collecting images in my head, tear sheets in folders, and names of varieties of trees, shrubs, plants, and flowers that I think will be appropriate in this new and exciting landscape. And I&#x2019;ve tried to imagine if this time will be any different from when I designed and dug (and double dug), then planted my very first, and very modest, garden in front of our tiny, white clapboard single-story cottage in the Berkshire mountains of Massachusetts.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was my very own garden, where I was free from my father&#x2019;s beautifully modulated instructor&#x2019;s voice telling me what to do, and how to do it, in his backyard garden. Here, I was relaxed and confident that I could plant a noteworthy, productive garden. At that time, my guidance came from my father, of course, but also from some wonderful books and places that influenced me profoundly: the writings of Vita Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll, and Helena Rutherfurd Ely, and the historic gardens that I loved visiting, including Monticello, Mount Vernon, the Mission House in nearby Stockbridge, and Old Sturbridge Village. Using a simple geometric plan, I laid out a front-path garden, which captured the sunlight for most of the day. Recycled bricks, carefully cleaned of all old rubble and cement, were laid in walks of stone dust and edged in more bricks laid on the diagonal. I discovered early on the beauty and efficacy<br> of perennial planting, and most of the flowers there, in that small, pretty garden, were indeed perennials, interspersed with some herbs and very few annuals. <br> &nbsp;<br> My most vivid memories of that garden were the hours spent tending the beds, singing to my young child, Alexis, making up fairy-tale-like stories about the flowers, reiterating the common as well as Latin names so that they are still ingrained not only in my head but also in hers. I was so proud when she could recite the flower names to my friends, pointing out her favorite campanula, digitalis, or Papaver orientalis.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second, and the one that has been so instrumental in my subsequent development as a serious gardener, was the two-acre garden I designed and planted in Westport, Connecticut, on a perfect plot of south-facing land, and known as Turkey Hill. What began as two acres grew to four, and then in an orderly fashion to six as neighboring properties became available for purchase. Surrounding at first the 1805 farmhouse, which also played an important part in my entrepreneurial development, these gardens were my true testing ground, my &#x201c;college education&#x201d; for growing and experimenting, and my inspiration for putting pen to paper and writing books about subjects I loved. My first gardening book, Martha Stewart&#x2019;s Gardening: Month by Month, appeared in 1991. In that book, I described the challenges and rewards of planting and growing not only flowers but also trees and vegetables and shrubs. In the beginning, I did most of the gardening myself, choosing the plant material, planning the layouts of the beds, placing the young trees in appropriate places, and weeding, fertilizing, watering,<br> and grooming. I found that a half acre was doable, an acre not, and I hired my first two gardeners. They were not trained horticulturists, but they were very hardworking and each had a wonderful affinity for plants and their care. As my vision for the place expanded, they scurried to keep up, sometimes enlisting a brother or cousin to help. During this time, I traveled quite frequently to Europe and Asia, where I visited as many gardens as I could. My husband was a publisher, and he was working on Visions<br> of Paradise, an extraordinary volume about Europe&#x2019;s most beautiful gardens. We traveled to England, France, and Italy to see with our own eyes the gardens so faithfully displayed in the photographs. It was on this trip that I started to understand the true nature of a real gardener, and the true worth of great garden and landscape design. I discovered the most famous landscape architects&#x2014;in England, the Humphry Reptons, the William Kents, the Capability Browns; and in France, the Ren� de Girardins, the<br> Andr� Le N�tres, and the Andr� Mollets. I bought books devoted to their works, and read with great interest why this and not that! I was even very influenced by Claude Monet after several visits to Giverny, and my flower garden emulated those gardens in intensity of color and types of flowers.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Turkey Hill I made plenty of mistakes, but none that could not be remedied. I learned that gardening was enjoyment and sacrifice, that planting required inordinate patience and fortitude, and that instant gratification provided by planting large trees and established plants could be tempered with patience and smaller specimens, ultimately with better results.<br> &nbsp;<br> While at Turkey Hill I purchased my third garden, Lily Pond, a one-acre parcel of land surrounding a large shingle-style nineteenth-century home on a beautiful tree&#x2013;lined avenue in the village of East Hampton, Long Island. The climate, tempered by the proximity to the sea and the milder winters, was excellent for the cultivation of roses, and I was determined to grow a large assortment of old-world varieties&#x2014;shrubs as well as climbers. I began a yearlong search for as many roses as I could find. Fortunately, there existed several excellent growers in the United States and Canada, and I bought about six hundred bushes, the bare roots of which were delivered by post. For twenty-five years those bushes grew to produce very strong and beautiful blooms. The gardens perfumed the surrounding areas during June and July, and I was thrilled with the results. I studied the care and maintenance of roses, consulted great rosarians, and devised my own methods for successfully growing these amazing plants. We often featured those gardens in the pages of Martha Stewart Living. When the roses finally reached maturity, and began to decline from robust shrubs, I dug them all up and moved them to my farm in Katonah, a hamlet of Bedford, New York, hoping that a drastic change in climate and soil conditions might revive them. Happily, I can now report that they are thriving.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a brief moment in time, I owned about forty-five acres in Greenfield Hill, Fairfield, Connecticut. I truly believed that there I could create my &#x201c;big&#x201d; garden, but I quickly realized that the soil, the location, and even the size of the property were not ideal for my biggest effort. I do count Greenfield Hill as one of my gardens, my fourth, but only because I planted some incredible trees there, and actually spent time developing a master plan for the landscape, which was never to be. And I do miss those trees&#x2014;the gum tree with the flanged bark, the large-leafed Magnolia grandiflora trees, and the grove of mature gingko trees purchased from the New York Botanical Garden. <br> &nbsp;<br> While looking for that special place, where I could live and commute from, I bought on a whim my &#x201c;fifth&#x201d; garden, Skylands in Maine. The house and gardens of this 1925 American treasure were designed by two renowned architects: The house was designed by Duncan Candler, and the gardens were conceived by the great landscape architect Jens Jensen. Upon purchase of this hilltop place&#x2014;eighty-plus acres, numerous buildings, and more than a mile of road&#x2014;I became a caretaker of history, and I loved this new job. There was no grass to mow, yet acres of forest and moss to tend, and terraces and balconies of pink granite needing planted pots and statement ornamentation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Skylands has taught me a great deal about a different kind of gardening. Everything is subtle, subdued. On Mount Desert Island, everything takes its orders from nature. The moss is there, but it needs the year of fallen leaves and pine needles to be carefully blown off for it to burgeon into an emerald ground cover. To keep the forest mighty and populated, trees need pruning to allow sunlight and air to help them grow strong and shapely. Gardens need to be placed where there is sunlight, and the soil must be amended with compost, seaweed, and nutrients. The gardener has to learn to cope with extremes of weather and a short but quick season once the growing starts.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Skylands has also reinforced the necessity for careful garden planning&#x2014;what to plant, when to plant, how much to plant&#x2014;so that the house can be filled with plumes of Cotinus (smoke bush), myriad branches of lilacs, dozens of lilies, and hundreds of sunflowers when I am there. That is when the house is always full of guests, and dinner parties are planned, and the garden is my only go-to source.<br> &nbsp;<br> At present my biggest garden project is Cantitoe Farm, my 150-acre property in Katonah, about fifty miles north of New York City. It is still a &#x201c;work in progress,&#x201d; a landscape with flower gardens, farm animals, horses, vegetable gardens, and greenhouses. I bought the place in 2000 and intended it to be my &#x201c;last garden.&#x201d; I do not know if that will be the case, but it is certainly my largest garden to date. Simply laid out, on land that is gently sloping from one end (south) to the other (north), and intersected with smallish streams, the property is about 50 percent woodland and 50 percent pastures, fields, and gardens. There is lots of space to express my landscape ideas and ideals&#x2014;four miles of curvaceous carriage roads enable me to quickly traverse from one end to the other on foot, on horseback, or by truck. The biggest accomplishment so far has been the careful delineation of spaces, the planting of all�es of trees as well as boxwood, and my inclination now to replant the woodlands with many groves<br> of interesting indigenous trees and plants. I have planted masses of my favorite kinds of flowers: a giant bed of pink-colored peonies; a very large perennial garden filled with all of my favorite lilies, poppies, and irises, among hundreds of others; two long gardens filled with many kinds of lilac shrubs; and borders of hydrangeas, Japanese maple trees, clematis, shade plants, and tulip beds.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is no lack of flowers at the farm for arranging and enjoying, and no shortage of incredible opportunities to plant more of everything. I have become more interested now in variety, more picky with color choices, more critical of each and every thing I have nurtured, wanting each plant to be healthy, each flower to be usable, and the gardens to be a constant source of inspiration to others, notably Kevin Sharkey. Kevin came to work at Martha Stewart Living, the magazine, in 1996. He and I became instant colleagues and instant friends. Bostonian by birth, Kevin was educated at Rhode Island School of Design. He began his career at Parish-Hadley, the renowned decorating firm in New York City. (During school he had interned at the Arnold Arboretum, where he became knowledgeable about trees and shrubs, especially lilacs.) His love of flowers grew as he decorated rooms in homes of famous gardeners&#x2014;Mrs. Vincent Astor, for one, and Mrs. Jock Whitney.<br> &nbsp;<br> Walking through my gardens years ago, it became clear to both of us that I was the grower, and he was the cutter and arranger. It was as if I wrote the music, and he wrote the lyrics. We started our collaboration at Turkey Hill in Westport and then continued it in East Hampton, in Katonah, and in Seal Harbor, Maine. Kevin knows my gardens almost as well as I do, and he knows exactly what will please me, what will look good in the planned location, and what will not. When he ventures out into the landscape to pick and combine what I have grown into coherent &#x201c;wholes,&#x201d; he creates beautiful arrangements that fit the spaces allocated, the season, and the occasion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the last two decades, we have learned a lot about each other&#x2014;and flowers. Together we often plan the types of flowers we will plant in a new garden, and we have concocted beautiful gardening glossaries and articles for the magazine. I trust him with scissors in my garden like I trust no other, except for my daughter Alexis. <br> &nbsp;<br> The bouquets and arrangements in this book resulted from our close planning and envisioning&#x2014;and luck&#x2014;in growing spectacular blooms that combine well with one another, or with foliage, to bedazzle a room or call one&#x2019;s eyes to attention. <br> &nbsp;<br> We are thrilled with the result of our labor, and hope you will be too.<br> &nbsp;<br> And my motto for this book remains the same as in my first gardening book: Pour l&#x2019;avenir, from the French, meaning &#x201c;For the future.&#x201d;</p><h2>Haiti: The Aftershocks of History</h2><p><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year</b> </p><p>Even before the devastating 2010 earthquake, Haiti was known as a benighted place of poverty and corruption, blamed by many for its own wretchedness. But as acclaimed historian Laurent Dubois demonstrates, Haiti's troubled present can only be understood by examining its complex past. The country's difficulties are inextricably rooted in its founding revolution---the only successful slave revolt in the history of the world; the hostility that this rebellion generated among the surrounding colonial powers; and the intense struggle within Haiti itself to define its newfound freedom and realize its promise. <br>Revealing what lies behind the familiar moniker "the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere," this indispensable book illuminates the foundations on which a new Haiti might yet emerge.</p></p><p><p><b>Laurent Dubois </b>is the author of <i>Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution</i>, a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Best Book of 2004. The Marcello Lotti Professor of Romance Studies and History at Duke University, Dubois has written on Haiti for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and the <i>New Yorker</i> Web site, among other publications, and is the codirector of the Haiti Lab at the Franklin Humanities Institute. He lives in Durham, North Carolina.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>"For eighty years Haiti has been judged," Louis-Joseph Janvier wrote in 1883. Since the birth of their country in 1804, Haitians had been incessantly "accused" by outsiders, and it was time for them to respond.1</p><p>A Haitian student living in Paris, Janvier was particularly outraged by a set of newspaper articles by Victor Cochinat, a visitor from the French colony of Martinique. Having spent a scant few weeks in Haiti, Cochinat had penned a cutting portrait of the country's culture, its people, and its politics. Some of his complaints were just those of a grouchy traveler: the porters in the harbor were disorderly and ill-clad, there was no set price for anything, Haiti's capital city of Port-au-Prince was dirty and unpleasant and full of beggars. But Cochinat quickly extrapolated much more. Haitians were lazy and "ashamed" of work, he wrote, which was why they were so poor. They spent too much money on rum. The children of the country were "lively and intelligent," but their parents gave them funny names&#x2014;instead of Paul or Jacques, they chose the names of Haitian heroes, Greek philosophers, and French writers&#x2014;and these, Cochinat asserted somewhat mysteriously, "interfere with their intellectual development." He teased that Haitians, having freed themselves from slavery, seemed "enamored" of the whip, using it against their children. Haiti, as he saw it, was a farce, a "phantasmagoria of civilization." It was a nation of "admirals without boats, generals without soldiers," and schools without teachers: a hopeless and absurd place with no future. Its attempt to look like a modern country was nothing more than a "joke."2</p><p>Seething, Janvier wrote a sardonic six-hundred-page history of "Haiti and its visitors." Many of these visitors had, like Cochinat, breezed through Haiti and then penned authoritative-sounding condemnations of the entire country. Janvier demanded at least a shred of objectivity. Was Haiti the only country with beggars in the streets? He'd noticed quite a few in Paris. Was it wrong for parents to name their children after great figures, in the hopes that their children would achieve great things? Janvier found himself having to remind his readers that Haitians were real people, living in a real society. They had their problems, to be sure, but they could not be reduced to mere caricatures, presented with no sense of context or history.</p><p>Janvier himself knew Haiti's challenges intimately. When he was born in 1855, Haiti was dominated by the unpopular emperor Soulouque, and of the five presidents who had ruled by the time he wrote his book, four were violently overthrown, with the country torn apart by civil wars. Janvier served his nation as a diplomat, a judge, and a politician, trying to confront the forces&#x2014;both external and internal&#x2014;that were holding the country back. He also became one of Haiti's great intellectuals; his fourteen books included several novels, a critique of European racism, and the classic study of Haiti's constitutional history. His defenses of his beloved land were eloquent, impassioned, erudite, and often funny.</p><p>But Janvier wasn't able to bring much change to Haiti; and he didn't make much of a dent, either, in the overwhelmingly hostile and distorted views held by most outsiders about the country. A few years after Janvier died, yet another Haitian president was overthrown in a bloody coup. The country was then occupied by the U.S. Marines, several of whom wrote popular accounts that portrayed Haiti as a dismal, backward place, full of lazy (if sometimes charming) peasants in the thrall of Vodou. In the decades since then, a succession of economic troubles and dictatorial regimes like that of Fran�ois "Papa Doc" Duvalier have reinforced the negative stereotypes. When Haiti appears at all in the media, it registers largely as a place of disaster, poverty, and suffering, populated by desperate people trying to escape.</p><p>On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by one of the deadliest earthquakes in modern history, which killed upwards of 230,000 people and left millions homeless. The country's National Palace, Port-au-Prince's historic cathedral, and the headquarters of the U.N. mission in the country were demolished. As troops and relief workers rushed to help, the familiar tropes emerged again. Nearly every mention of Haiti in the press reminded readers that it was "the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere," a moniker incessantly repeated like some dogged trademark. The coverage often made the country sound like some place entirely outside the West&#x2014;a primitive and incomprehensible territory&#x2014;rather than as a place whose history has been deeply intertwined with that of Europe and the United States for three centuries. And when people wanted to know how Haiti had come to be so poor, and why its government barely functioned, pundits offered a plethora of ill-informed speculation, like so many modern-day Cochinats. Many seemed all too ready to believe that the fault must lie with the Haitians themselves.</p><p>The day after the earthquake, televangelist Pat Robertson famously opined that Haitians were suffering because they had sold themselves to the devil. A more polite version of the same argument came from <i>New York Times</i> columnist David Brooks, who accused Haiti of having "progress-resistant cultural influences," including "the influence of the voodoo religion." Why else would the country be so poor, so miserable, when its immediate neighbor the Dominican Republic&#x2014;right there on the same island of Hispaniola&#x2014;was a comparatively prosperous Caribbean tourist attraction? Many called openly for Haiti to be made a protectorate. Brooks advocated "intrusive paternalism" that would change the local culture by promoting "No Excuses countercultures." Against such claims, other voices responded by placing the blame for the situation entirely on outside forces: foreign corporations, the U.S. and French governments, the International Monetary Fund. Nearly all of the coverage portrayed Haitians themselves as either simple villains or simple victims. More complex interpretations were few and far between.3</p><p>But the true causes of Haiti's poverty and instability are not mysterious, and they have nothing to do with any inherent shortcomings on the part of the Haitians themselves. Rather, Haiti's present is the product of its history: of the nation's founding by enslaved people who overthrew their masters and freed themselves; of the hostility that this revolution generated among the colonial powers surrounding the country; and of the intense struggle within Haiti itself to define that freedom and realize its promise.</p><p>���</p><p>A little more than two hundred years ago, the place that we now know as Haiti&#x2014;then the French colony of Saint-Domingue&#x2014;was perhaps the most profitable bit of land in the world. It was full of thriving sugar plantations, with slaves&#x2014;who made up nine-tenths of the colony's population&#x2014;planting and cutting cane and operating the mills and boiling houses that produced the sugar crystals coveted by European consumers. The plantation system was immensely lucrative, creating enormous fortunes in France. It was also brutally destructive. The plantations consumed the landscape: observers at the time already noted that alarmingly large areas of the forests had been chopped down for construction and for export of precious woods to Europe. And they consumed the lives of the colony's slaves at a murderous rate. Over the course of the colony's history, as many as a million slaves were brought from Africa to Saint-Domingue, but the work was so harsh that even with a constant stream of imports, the slave population constantly declined. Few children were born, and those that were often died young. By the late 1700s, the colony had about half a million slaves altogether. It was out of this brutal world that Haiti was born.4</p><p>In August 1791, slaves on the sugar plantations in the north of the colony launched the largest slave revolt in history. They set the cane fields on fire, killed their masters, and smashed all the instruments used to process the sugarcane. They took over the northern plantations, gained new recruits, and built an army and a political movement. Within two years, they had secured freedom for all the slaves in the colony. In 1794, the French government&#x2014;then in the hands of the radical Jacobins&#x2014;recognized that freedom and extended it, abolishing slavery throughout the French empire.</p><p>Between 1794 and 1801, Saint-Domingue remained nominally a French colony, led by Toussaint Louverture&#x2014;a former slave, now a French general. Louverture defended the territory from English invasion and sought to maintain the colony's plantation system, intent on proving to the world that it was possible to produce sugar and coffee without slavery. But when Napoleon Bonaparte sent troops to resurrect the order that had been destroyed by the 1791 uprising, the population, faced with the prospect of a return to slavery, rose up again. With Haiti's declaration of independence, the revolution was complete.</p><p>The aftershocks of that revolution reverberate throughout Haiti's history. The country emerged in a world still dominated by slavery, and the nations that surrounded it saw its existence as a serious threat. For decades France refused to recognize Haiti's independence, maintaining that it still had sovereignty over its onetime colony, and the governments of England and the United States followed France's lead. Haiti's political isolation and the constant threats directed at it weighed heavily on its early leaders, who keenly felt the burden of proving to the world that a black nation could succeed. To defend against possible attack, they poured money into building fortifications and maintaining a large army. Being Haiti, it turned out, was costly. What's more, this emphasis on military readiness meant that, from the start, civilian concerns were often subordinated to the army's needs.</p><p>The colony of Saint-Domingue had been built and po...</p></p><h2>Are We Together?: A Protestant Analyzes Roman Catholicism</h2><p><p>In recent years, some evangelical Protestant leaders have signed statements pledging themselves to joint social action with Roman Catholics. Others have refused to participate, declaring that, in their view, the statements went too far, touching on the gospel, which remains a point of disagreement between Protestants and Roman Catholics. Many evangelical Christians have found themselves confused by the different directions taken by their leaders.</p><p>In <i>Are We Together? A Protestant Analyzes Roman Catholicism</i>, R.C. Sproul takes his stand for the cardinal doctrines of Protestantism in opposition to the errors of the Roman Catholic Church. Sproul, a passionate defender of the gospel of justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, cites the historic statements of the Protestant Reformers and the Roman Catholic authorities, then references modern doctrinal statements to show that the Roman Catholic Church has not altered its official positions. In light of this continuing gap, he writes, efforts by some in the evangelical camp to find common ground with Rome on matters at the heart of the gospel are nothing short of untrue to biblical teaching. In Sproul&#x2019;s estimation, the Reformation remains relevant.</p><p><i>Are We Together?</i> is a clarion call to evangelicals to stand firm for the gospel, the precious good news of salvation as it is set forth in Scripture alone.</p></p><p><p>Dr. R.C. Sproul (1939&#x2013;2017) was founder of Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian discipleship organization located near Orlando, Fla. He was also founding pastor of Saint Andrew&#x2019;s Chapel in Sanford, Fla., first president of Reformation Bible College, and executive editor of <i>Tabletalk</i> magazine. His radio program, <i>Renewing Your Mind</i>, is still broadcast daily on hundreds of radio stations around the world and can also be heard online. Dr. Sproul contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, spoke at conferences, churches, colleges, and seminaries around the world, and wrote more than one hundred books, including <i>The Holiness of God</i>, <i>Chosen by God</i>, and <i>Everyone&#x2019;s a Theologian</i>. He also served as general editor of the <i>Reformation Study Bible</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;R.C. Sproul covers the issues candidly and objectively&#x2014;without the emotion and demagoguery that so often pervade the abortion debate. You are the jury; you decide the verdict.&#x201d;</p> -- Dr. John MacArthur<br><br><p>&#x201c;Classic Sproul! Logical, clear, fair, attempting to understand the pro-choice views while all the time making a solid, biblical pro-life apologetic that seeks both to convince the opponents but also to bring about in practical ways the end of this North American holocaust. Add to that the foreword of George Grant and you have a winner.&#x201d;</p> -- Dr. Peter Jones<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is an important book for all Christians interested in bringing their beliefs to bear upon the world around them. Abortion is one of the most critical issues of our day, and R.C. Sproul looks at it through the lenses of theology, philosophy, and reason. This book is refreshingly free of hyperbole, and yet does not compromise the truth.&#x201d;</p> -- Jim Daly<br><br><p>&#x201c;R.C. Sproul&#x2019;s rapier logic will put to flight rationalistic defenders of abortion. Those torn between conflicting claims about the humanity of the unborn, the role of government, and the rights of women will find this book particularly instructive.&#x201d;</p> -- Marvin Olasky<br><br><p>&#x201c;R.C. Sproul&#x2019;s book on abortion is a classic text in the evangelical witness against the culture of death. I pray this Twentieth Anniversary Edition will awaken a new generation of Christians to the joyful duty of protecting the &#x2018;least of these,&#x2019; our Lord Jesus&#x2019; unborn brothers and sisters.&#x201d;</p> -- Russell D. Moore<br><br><p>&#x201c;Staying silent on the issue of abortion is no longer an option. It is time for those who are respected and capable to speak out and say it straight. I know of no one who qualifies better than R.C. Sproul.&#x201d;</p> -- Chuck Swindoll<br><br><p>&#x201c;I am delighted to see this Twentieth Anniversary Edition of <i>Abortion: A Rational Look at an Emotional Issue.</i> It was and continues to be an important contribution to the pro-life movement and to the defense of the sanctity of human life.&#x201d;</p> -- John Jefferson Davis</p><h2>Progressive Dystopia: Abolition, Antiblackness, and Schooling in San Francisco</h2><p>San Francisco is the endgame of gentrification, where racialized displacement means that the Black population of the city hovers at just over 3 percent. The Robeson Justice Academy opened to serve the few remaining low-income neighborhoods of the city, with the mission of offering liberatory, social justice--themed education to youth of color. While it features a progressive curriculum including Frantz Fanon and Audre Lorde, the majority Latinx school also has the district's highest suspension rates for Black students. In <i>Progressive Dystopia</i> Savannah Shange explores the potential for reconciling the school's marginalization of Black students with its sincere pursuit of multiracial uplift and solidarity. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and six years of experience teaching at the school, Shange outlines how the school fails its students and the community because it operates within a space predicated on antiblackness. Seeing San Francisco as a social laboratory for how Black communities survive the end of their worlds, Shange argues for abolition over revolution or progressive reform as the needed path toward Black freedom.</p><p>Savannah Shange is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and principal faculty in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&#x201c;At the center of Savannah Shange's powerful analysis in progressive dystopia: abolition, anthropology, and race in the new San Francisco are the multiple and seemingly conflicting forces brought to bear on the Black girls and boys who attend the Robeson Justice Academy in the contested space that makes up Frisco. Shange theorizes a set of &#x2018;common sense&#x2019; &#x2018;progressive&#x2019; logics that reproduce the carceral&#x2014;what she names progressive dystopia and carceral progressivism&#x2014;and then the willful defiance that characterizes the refusals and political demands of the Black girl students, in particular, who refuse to bear and internalize what Hartman names as &#x2018;burdened individualism.&#x2019; This is a profoundly important book.&#x201d; -- Christina Sharpe, author of, <i>In the Wake: On Blackness and Being</i></p><h2>Gunpowder Green (A Tea Shop Mystery)</h2><p>Tea shop owner Theodosia Browning knows that something&#x2019;s brewing in the high society of Charleston&#x2014;something other than her newest tea... <p>The Indigo Tea Shop, Charleston&#x2019;s favorite spot of tea, has just come out with its latest flavor: Gunpowder Green.

She strips away the biases implicit in conventional stereotypes of female nature to give us very different and provocative perspectives on maternal ambivalence, the links between maturity and ambition, mother love and sexual love, and why age-old tensions between the sexes persist--and are being played out today in efforts to control women's reproductive choices.<br><br>Combining decades of research with her own experience as a mother, Hrdy makes clear in this remarkable book what it means--from a historical and evolutionary perspective--to be a mother and explains how this knowledge has transformed our understanding of human development and behavior.</p><p><i>Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants, and Natural Selection</i> should be required reading for anyone who happens to be a human being. In it, Hrdy reveals the motivations behind some of our most primal and hotly contested behavioral patterns--those concerning gender roles, mate choice, sex, reproduction, and parenting--and the ideas and institutions that have grown up around them. She unblinkingly examines and illuminates such difficult subjects as control of reproductive rights, infanticide, "mother love," and maternal ambition with its ever-contested companions: child care and the limits of maternal responsibility. Without ever denying personal accountability, she points out that many of the patterns of abuse and neglect that we see in cultures around the world (including, of course, our own) are neither unpredictable nor maladaptive in evolutionary terms. "Mother" Nature, as she points out, is not particularly concerned with what we call "morality." The philosophical and political implications of our own deeply-rooted behaviors are for us to determine--which can be done all the better with the kind of understanding gleaned from this exhaustive work.<p> Hrdy's passion for this material is evident, and she is deeply aware of the personal stake she has here as a woman, a mother, and a professional. This highly accomplished author relies on her own extensive research background as well as the works of others in multiple disciplines (anthropology, primatology, sociobiology, psychology, and even literature). Despite the exhaustive documentation given to her conclusions (as witness the 140-plus-page notes and bibliography sections), the book unfolds in an exceptionally lucid, readable, and often humorous manner. It is a truly compelling read, highly recommended. <i>--Katherine Ferguson</i></p>"Sarah Hrdy's magisterial survey of childbearing through the ages sets a new standard for the graceful blending of scholarship, field research and personal experience. As meticulously documented as the book is, it never loses the human touch...<b>Mother Nature</b> is one of those landmark books that forces you to rethink everything you thought you knew about human nature..."<br>-- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><p>"This is a superb book. It is beautifully and clearly written, by one of the nation's leading primatologists and sociobiologists, without sacrificing intellectual rigor; it is the best introduction I know to both fields. It establishes more convincingly than any other work with which I am familiar the relevance of the study of (other) primates and of human evolution, to urgent current issues of public policy involving women, children, and the family."<br>-- Richard Posner, Chief Judge, US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit<br><br>"A magnificent synthesis of ideas about motherhood, this is a book brimming with warmth, wisdom, and wit. It is not easy in a polarised academic world to keep a foot in the feminist camp and another in evolutionary psychology, nor to bridge the arts and sciences so effortlessly. But Sarah Blaffer Hrdy achieves these feats."<br>-- Matt Ridley, author of <b>The Origins of Virtue : Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation</b> <br><br>"Hrdy has given us a truly monumental work, as elegant as it is insightful. It took a woman scientist to find the rightful place of our species in the matrix of the animal kingdom, and Hrdy has done so brilliantly. This is by no means the usual psychobabble or hodge podge of animal behavior that other authors so often use to define us -- here is a clear and telling examination of a hitherto almost unknown organism -- the human female. Any woman wanting to know who she really is will find out in the pages of this tremendously important work of real science by a real scientist."<br>-- Elizabeth Marshall Thomas<br><br>"This is a brilliant, liberating book on a profoundly important subject. Sarah Hrdy, the leading scientific authority on motherhood, is also, to the benefit of us all, one of the best stylists now writing on any subject in science."<br>-- E.O. Wilson<br><br>"<b>Mother Nature</b> is a pioneering reassessment of key assumptions in debates about human evolution. By demonstrating how female strategies as mates and mothers have shaped the evolutionary process throughout nature, Hrdy succeeds in overturning some of the most entrenched theories in this scientific domain. A worthy companion to Darwin's <b>Descent of Man</b>, and an endlessly fascinating read, <b>Mother Nature</b> reflects a lifetime of bold research and judicious thought by one of the foremost primatologists of our day."<br>-- Frank Sulloway<br><br>"<b>Mother Nature</b> is a stunning achievement. The book reveals the highest scholarship with an unparalleled breadth in the use of the comparative method. Hrdy expertly uses the comparative method. Hrdy expertly uses the comparative method to illustrate her points by contrasting biology and behavior across species and orders, and by making full use of human variation both through evolutionary and historical time and across space and cultures. This book is a very accessible, scientific discussion of the evolutionary history of maternal care written by a first rate scientist."--Jane B. Lancaster, Editor of <i>Human Nature</i><br><br>"By demolishing superstitions that have long clouded our true natures, Sarah Hrdy shows how knowledge may be our best tool for achieving justice among women, men, and the generations that follow. Clear-eyed science can equip us for this liberating journey, far better than any rigid ideology. <b>Mother Nature</b> takes us one bold step along that road."<br>-- David Brin, author of <b>Glory Season</b> and <b>The Transparent Society</b><br><br>"This is a deep and brilliant work, a masterful account of mother nature and the nature of motherhood, with a superb selection of photos, built on a powerful logic by someone who easily and clearily sees life both from the inside and the outside."<br>-- Robert Trivers, Professor of Anthropology and Biological Sciences, Rutgers University</p></p><h2>The Red Circle: My Life in the Navy SEAL Sniper Corps and How I Trained America&#39;s Deadliest Marksmen</h2><p>Brandon Webb&#39;s experiences in the world&#39;s most elite sniper corps are the stuff of legend.

For Australian aborigines it was the walkabout, young males trekking the outback for as long as six months to trace the ceremonial paths, or dreaming tracks, taken by their ancestors. Mormon boys ages nineteen to twenty-five are sent around the world for two years to do full-time mission work.<br>For me, it was shorter and simpler. My rite of passage came when I was thrown off a boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean by my dad, a few weeks past my sixteenth birthday. I had to find my own path home from that oceanic wilderness, and it turned out to be a path that ultimately led to the most elite sniper corps in the world.<br>I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;d call that a dreaming track, exactly, but you <i>could</i> say it was a path taken by my ancestors, at least in one sense: My father was thrown out of the house at age sixteen by <i>his</i> father, too. And I suppose the only way to make sense out of my story is to start with him.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Jack Webb grew up in Toronto, short, strong, and stocky. A talented hockey player and avid drummer, he was always a bit of a wild man. A true child of the sixties, Jack grew out his full black beard as soon as his hormones would cooperate. His father hewed to old-fashioned values and threatened to kick Jack out if he didn&#x2019;t cut his beard and long hair. When my father refused, out he went.<br>My grandfather may have thrown his son out, but he didn&#x2019;t succeed in changing his mind. To this day my dad still sports a full beard, though its black is now flecked with gray.<br>Now on his own, Jack made his way from Toronto to Malibu, where he picked up landscaping jobs and soon had his own company. Driving home from a job one day, he picked up three young hippie girls hitchhiking. One of them, a free spirit named Lynn, became his wife.<br>After they married, my parents moved up to British Columbia to the little ski town of Kimberley, just north of Vancouver, where he took a job as a guide at a hunting lodge, despite the fact that he knew absolutely nothing about hunting. The guy who hired him said, &#x201c;Look, don&#x2019;t worry about it. Stay on the trail, and you&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d; He was. His first time out, he took a small group into the Canadian Rockies, pointing out all sorts of wildlife along the way. When they got back, the group told my dad&#x2019;s boss he&#x2019;d hired the greatest guide in the world. They didn&#x2019;t know he was flat-out winging it.<br>Soon Jack was working construction, and on the job he taught himself everything there was to know about building houses. In those days, if you were a builder you did it all&#x2014;pouring the foundation, framing, wiring, drywall, plumbing, roofing, everything from <i>A</i> to <i>Z</i>. Jack had never graduated high school, but he was a resourceful man with a big appetite for learning, and he soon became an accomplished builder with his own company, High Country Construction.<br>It was about this time that I came into the picture, followed a few years later by my sister, Rhiannon, and once I arrived on the scene my mother&#x2019;s life became considerably more complicated.<br>Free spirit though she may be, my mother has always been fiercely loyal to me and my sister, and to my dad, too, as far as that was possible. I always felt completely loved and supported by her, even through the difficulties to come.<br>My mother has also always been very entrepreneurial. She opened up a restaurant with my dad&#x2019;s sister, and later, when we lived in Washington for a while, she had her own boat maintenance business, sanding and varnishing the boats and keeping the woodwork in good condition. She wrote and published her own cookbook for boaters, <i>The Galley Companion.</i> Later still, when I worked on a California dive boat in my teens, she held a job there as head cook.<br>One more thing about my mom: She has always had a great sense of humor.<br>She would have had to, to cope with me.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I was born on June 12, 1974, screaming at the top of my tiny lungs, and I screamed for weeks. For the next ten months I stayed awake every night from ten till seven the next morning, yelling my head off, at which point I would sleep blissfully through the day while my mom recovered from the night&#x2019;s battle fatigue. My parents did everything they could to keep me awake during the day so they would have a shot at getting me to sleep at night. Didn&#x2019;t matter. It wasn&#x2019;t going to happen.<br>According to my mom, I was as wild as the Canadian landscape. I started crawling at six months and crawled <i>everywhere</i>. My mom talks about a study she heard about, where they put babies on a glass counter to see how far they would crawl. Nearly all the babies would stop when they got close to the edge&#x2014;but the last 1 percent went crawling off into thin air every time.<br>&#x201c;That 1 percent?&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That was Brandon.&#x201d;<br>I started walking at nine months, and there was not a gate or door that could hold me. My mom bought every childproof lock she could find, but evidently &#x201c;childproof&#x201d; did not mean &#x201c;Brandon-proof.&#x201d; She had doorknobs that even she couldn&#x2019;t open, but I always managed to get through them. She would lock me into my high chair, but if she stepped into the bathroom for even a moment, I&#x2019;d be gone when she returned.<br>By eighteen months I discovered the joys of climbing and found I could climb up, over, and into pretty much anything. This ability, combined with my easy friendship with locks and predilection for drinking anything I could get my hands on, added up to quite a few visits to the emergency room to have my little toddler-sized stomach pumped. Among the beverages I sampled during those early years were kerosene, bleach, and Avon honeysuckle after-bath splash. I&#x2019;m not saying this is a method I would endorse or recommend, but I am convinced that this is why I have always been able to hold my liquor and have never had a problem with addiction. By the time I was three, the hospital emergency room staff and my mom knew each other on a first-name basis.<br>When my mom was pregnant with my sister, my dad built an enclosure with a swing and what he thought was a Brandon-proof gate. (There&#x2019;s that term again: &#x201c;Brandon-proof.&#x201d; Hadn&#x2019;t they learned?) My mom still doesn&#x2019;t know how I got out, since she was sitting right there reading a book&#x2014;but she looked up and I was gone: I had crawled under a barbed-wire fence, scooted down a steep hill, and was out of sight.<br>My mother was wild with fear. Seven months pregnant, she knew there was no way she could get under that barbed-wire fence, and she didn&#x2019;t have any wire cutters. The night before, she and my father had seen a pack of coyotes ranging around, and now all she could think of was how her tiny son would make a tasty little coyote meal. The only reason she spotted me was that I was wearing a red sweatshirt. Somehow she managed to coax me back up the hill and under the fence so she could grab me, crying hysterically and at the same time wanting to beat me.<br>From my earliest years, I always had a penchant for danger and physical extremes, and it made my poor mother&#x2019;s life a living hell. She likes to say that when I was little, she was the victim of parent abuse. She once called Social Services on herself when I had driven her to the edge with my behavior. She explained to the poor lady on the phone that her two-year-old son was driving her so crazy, she was about to hurt him. The social worker spent a week at our house observing, but I behaved like an angel for those seven days, and she left thinking my mom must <i>be</i> crazy.<br>It didn&#x2019;t take long for my parents to figure out that while they couldn&#x2019;t control my wild energy, they <i>could</i> channel it. Once they saw how madly in love I was with skiing, they knew they&#x2019;d stumbled on the parenting strategy that would serve us all well for years to come: If they could get me involved in every sports activity possible, maybe it would keep me out of trouble. It did, too&#x2014;at least for a while.<br>By age five I was on a ski team, and by age seven I had piled wrestling, football, baseball, swim, and track teams onto my athletic schedule. Later, as an adult, I found I have a love of extreme sports. The steeper the ski slope, the larger the wave, the higher the cliff, the more difficult the jump from the plane or helicopter&#x2014;the more danger and adrenaline involved, the more I want to try to conquer it. In my thirties, I would channel that same impulse into a drive to conquer huge goals in the entrepreneurial world. At the age of five, my Mount Everest was a 2,500-foot hill called North Star Mountain.<br>My earliest memories are of the crisp cold in my face and the sibilant <i>schusss</i> of the snow under my skis as I flew down the face of North Star. Every day, during the long months of ski season, my mom would pick me up from kindergarten and drive us straight out to the slopes. We had a season pass, and we used up every penny of it.<br>Less than half the height of its more famous neighbors, Whistler and Blackcomb, North Star is not really much of a mountain, but I didn&#x2019;t know that. To me, it seemed vast and inexhaustible. When I think back on my early childhood, what I remember most are the countless afternoons on my bright yellow Mickey Mouse K2 skis, exploring every trail and out-of-the-way patch of what seemed to me an endless world of snow and adventure.<br>My best friend at the time was a kid named Justin, who was as devoted to skiing as I was. We would spend every afternoon we could exploring North Star together. Justin and I got into ski racing and joined a team. By the time we were in first grade, our team was competing in tournaments at...</p><h2>Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy (American Empire Project)</h2><p>The world's foremost critic of U.S. foreign policy exposes the hollow promises of democracy in American actions abroad--and at home<br><br>The United States has repeatedly asserted its right to intervene against "failed states" around the globe. In this much anticipated sequel to his international bestseller Hegemony or Survival, Noam Chomsky turns the tables, charging the United States with being a "failed state," and thus a danger to its own people and the world. <br><br>"Failed states" Chomsky writes, are those "that do not protect their citizens from violence and perhaps even destruction, that regard themselves as beyond the reach of domestic or international law, and that suffer from a 'democratic deficit,' having democratic forms but with limited substance." Exploring recent U.S. foreign and domestic policies, Chomsky assesses Washington's escalation of the nuclear risk; the dangerous consequences of the occupation of Iraq; and America's self-exemption from international law. He also examines an American electoral system that frustrates genuine political alternatives, thus impeding any meaningful democracy.<br><br>Forceful, lucid, and meticulously documented, <i>Failed States </i>offers a comprehensive analysis of a global superpower that has long claimed the right to reshape other nations while its own democratic institutions are in severe crisis, and its policies and practices have recklessly placed the world on the brink of disaster. Systematically dismantling America's claim to being the world's arbiter of democracy, <i>Failed States </i>is Chomsky's most focused--and urgent--critique to date.<br><br></p><p><p>Noam Chomsky is the author of numerous bestselling political works, including <i>Hegemony or Survival</i>, <i>Failed States, Imperial Ambitions</i> and <i>What We Say Goes</i>. A professor of linguistics and philosophy at MIT, he is widely credited with having revolutionized modern linguistics. He lives outside Boston, Massachusetts.</p>Preface<br>&nbsp;<br>The selection of issues that should rank high on the agenda of concern for human welfare and rights is, naturally, a subjective matter. But there are a few choices that seem unavoidable, because they bear so directly on the prospects for decent survival. Among them are at least these three: nuclear war, environmental disaster, and the fact that the government of the world's leading power is acting in ways that increase the likelihood of these catastrophes. It is important to stress the government, because the population, not surprisingly, does not agree. That brings up a fourth issue that should deeply concern Americans, and the world: the sharp divide between public opinion and public policy, one of the reasons for the fear, which cannot casually be put aside, that "the American 'system' as a whole is in real trouble--that it is heading in a direction that spells the end of its historic values [of] equality, liberty, and meaningful democracy."1<br>&nbsp;<br>The "system" is coming to have some of the features of failed states, to adopt a currently fashionable notion that is conventionally applied to states regarded as potential threats to our security (like Iraq) or as needing our intervention to rescue the population from severe internal threats (like Haiti). Though the concept is recognized to be "frustratingly imprecise," some of the primary characteristics of failed states can be identified. One is their inability or unwillingness to protect their citizens from violence and perhaps even destruction. Another is their tendency to regard themselves as beyond the reach of domestic or international law, and hence free to carry out aggression and violence. And if they have democratic forms, they suffer from a serious "democratic deficit" that deprives their formal democratic institutions of real substance.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Among the hardest tasks that anyone can undertake, and one of the most important, is to look honestly in the mirror. If we allow ourselves to do so, we should have little difficulty in finding the characteristics of "failed states" right at home. That recognition of reality should be deeply troubling to those who care about their countries and future generations. "Countries," plural, because of the enormous reach of US power, but also because the threats are not localized in space or time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first half of this book is devoted mostly to the increasing threat of destruction caused by US state power, in violation of international law, a topic of particular concern for citizens of the world dominant power, however one assesses the relevant threats. The second half is concerned primarily with democratic institutions, how they are conceived in the elite culture and how they perform in reality, both in "promoting democracy" abroad and shaping it at home.<br>&nbsp;<br>The issues are closely interlinked, and arise in several contexts. In discussing them, to save excessive footnoting I will omit sources when they can easily be found in recent books of mine.3<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by Harry Chomsky, as Trustee of Chomsky Grandchildren Nominee Trust</p><h2>Weimar Culture:The Outsider As Insider</h2><p><p><strong>A seminal work as melodious and haunting as the era it chronicles, now reissued with a new introduction.</strong></p>First published in 1968, <em>Weimar Culture</em> is one of the masterworks of Peter Gay's distinguished career.

She died in 1976. </p>Could a new collection of Agatha Christie stories be discovered more than 20 years after the death of the doyenne of mystery writers? It appears to be true, as six in this collection of nine stories have never before been published in the U.S. Even more interesting, several of the stories, including &#34;The Edge&#34; and &#34;The House of Dreams,&#34; have a disposition to darker, more psychological suspense than is usual for Christie&#39;s work. Although the single Hercule Poirot story, &#34;The Mystery of the Spanish Chest,&#34; seems the usual fare of a drawing-room mystery, several others may remind listeners more of Ruth Rendell than Christie. Alexandra Thomas has a light voice with clear English diction and a slight informality that gives listeners a sense of intimacy with the narrator. Most recordings of Christie&#39;s work have male narrators, including David Suchet, noted for his success as Poirot on PBS Mystery! Alexandra Thomas&#39;s relaxed and confident voice is a welcome change. If the stories were queued individually on a single side or one story per cassette, the stories could be selected at random. R.F.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Long March: How the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Changed America</h2><p>In The Long March, Roger Kimball, the author of Tenured Radicals, shows how the &#34;cultural revolution&#34; of the 1960s and &#39;70s took hold in America, lodging in our hearts and minds, and affecting our innermost assumptions about what counts as the good life. Kimball believes that the counterculture transformed high culture as well as our everyday life in terms of attitudes toward self and country, sex and drugs, and manners and morality. Believing that this dramatic change &#34;cannot be understood apart from the seductive personalities who articulated its goals,&#34; he intersperses his argument with incisive portraits of the life and thought of Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Timothy Leary, Susan Sontag, Eldridge Cleaver and other &#34;cultural revolutionaries&#34; who made their mark. For all that has been written about the counterculture, until now there has not been a chronicle of how this revolutionary movement succeeded and how its ideas helped provoke today&#39;s &#34;culture wars.&#34; The Long March fills this gap with a compelling and well-informed narrative that is sure to provoke discussion and debate.</p><p>The 1960s, writes Roger Kimball, "has become less the name of a decade than a provocation." This incisive critique of that turbulent time won't calm the debate. <i>The Long March</i> will enthrall conservatives who think of themselves as culture warriors and infuriate liberals who still celebrate "the purple decade." Kimball, managing editor of the <i>New Criterion</i> and author of <i>Tenured Radicals</i>, is one of the Right's most articulate writers. He argues forcefully that the pernicious influence of the 1960s can still be felt: "The success of America's recent cultural revolution can be measured not in toppled governments but in shattered values. If we often forget what great changes this revolution brought in its wake, that, too, is a sign of its success: having changed ourselves, we no longer perceive the extent of our transformation." <p> <i>The Long March</i> proceeds as a series of stimulating essays on important cultural figures and movements, beginning with the Beats. Norman Mailer comes in for an eloquent trashing ("From the late 1940s until the 1980s, he showed himself to be extraordinarily deft at persuading credulous intellectuals to collaborate in his megalomania"), as do any number of counterculture icons. I.F. Stone's articles, writes Kimball, "read like neo-Stalinist equivalents of those multipart articles on staple crops with which <i>The New Yorker</i> used to anesthetize its readers." And of <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, that bastion of elite liberal opinion, Kimball says: "Quite apart from the irresponsibility of the politics, there was an intellectual irresponsibility at work here, a preening, ineradicable frivolousness toward the cultural values that the journal was supposedly created to nurture." There's a distinctly conservative crankiness to Kimball's writing; the jazz of Miles Davis is inevitably "drug-inspired" and rock music "was not only an aesthetic disaster of gigantic proportions: it was also a moral disaster whose effects are nearly impossible to calculate precisely because they are so pervasive." Yet this inclination can lead to fascinating, if arguable, insights about modern American culture: "Everywhere one looks one sees the elevation of youth--that is to say, of immaturity--over experience. It may seem like a small thing that nearly everyone of whatever age dresses in blue jeans now; but the universalization of that sartorial badge of the counterculture speaks volumes." </p><p> Kimball's writing is at once highbrow and accessible. Fans of Robert Bork's <i>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</i> and Allan Bloom's <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>--or readers who have never quite believed all the English professors proclaiming Allen Ginsberg a poetic genius--will find <i>The Long March</i> engrossing and indispensable. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>"How deeply rooted are our nation's cultural problems? What is the legacy of the 1960s? Where are America's culture wars going? Few people take these important questions more seriously than Roger Kimball. And few write about them with such clarity and eloquence."--William J. Bennett <p>"I think it is terrific. . . . We haven't had a radical analysis like this--ever."--William F. Buckley, Jr. </p><p>"The extent of the cultural revolution we have lived through since the Sixties is still not clear to us, nor is its meaning. Roger Kimball has produced a searching and comprehensive study that brings it alltogether, high and low, from Herbert Marcuse to Monica Lewinsky. His well-told story is equal to the amazing event. It shows the routinization of exciting ideals, and the power and impotence of ideas."--Harvey C. Mansfield </p><p>"Roger Kimball is among our most intelligent, thoughtful, and provocative cultural critics. He also is uncommon in that he writes lucidly and persuasively."--Irving Kristol --</p></p><h2>The Art of William Morris in Cross Stitch</h2><p>Cross stitch designs for pillows, table linens, and flower pictures draw inspiration from Morris&#39;s printed fabrics, tapestries, and printing from his Kelmscott Press</p><p>Barbara Hammet taught at the Cambridge College of Art and Technology.</p><h2>Rabbit Hole</h2><p>David Lindsay-Abaire has crafted a drama that&#x2019;s not just a departure but a revelation an intensely emotional examination of grief, laced with wit, insightfulness, compassion and searing honesty.&#x201d; David Rooney, <i>Variety</i><br><br> A beautifully observed new play blessed with David Lindsay-Abaire&#x2019;s customary grace and wit.&#x201d; Ben Brantley, <i>New York Times</i><br><br> With <i>Rabbit Hole</i>, David Lindsay-Abaire has crafted the most serious, simply told work of his career a painstakingly beautiful, dramatically resourceful, exquisitely human new play.&#x201d; <i> Backstage</i><br><br>A story of loss, heartbreak and forgiveness told through daily moments and emotional hurdles as a family moves on after the accidental death of their 4-year-old.

As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Meat Eater </i>chronicles Rinella&#x2019;s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do.<br> &nbsp;<br> A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of &#x201c;Tasting Notes&#x201d; that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire. In <i>Meat Eater</i> he paints a loving portrait of a way of life that is part of who we are as humans and as Americans.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Meat Eater</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Full of empathy and intelligence . . .

Born and raised in Michigan, he currently lives in Brooklyn, New York.CHAPTER ONE<br><br> Standing Ground<br><br> This book has a hell of a lot going for it, simply because it&#x2019;s a hunting story. That&#x2019;s because hunting stories are the oldest and most widespread form of story on earth. The genre has been around so long, and has such deep roots, that it extends beyond humans. When two wolves meet up, they&#x2019;ll often go through a routine of smelling each other&#x2019;s breath. For a wolf to put his nose to another wolf&#x2019;s mouth is to pose a question: &#x201c;What happened while you were hunting?&#x201d; To exhale is to answer: &#x201c;You can still smell the blood.&#x201d;<br><br> Of course, nothing tells a hunting story like a human. Long ago, our ancestors may have told hunting stories in ways that are similar to those of animals today. It&#x2019;s been proposed that the human kiss finds its origins in a mouth-to-mouth greeting similar to that of the modern wolf&#x2019;s. Similarly, it&#x2019;s been proposed that the handshake originated as a way of proving that neither party was concealing a weapon.<br><br> But at some point&#x2014;at least by fifty thousand years ago, though possibly much earlier&#x2014;we began to tell our hunting stories through the complex languages that are now a hallmark of our species. Linguists and anthropologists theorize that complex language evolved just for this purpose: to coordinate hunting and gathering activities, to categorize an increasingly complex arsenal of hunting tools and weapons, and to convey details about animals and habitat that might be hidden from sight. In short, language came about for the same purposes that I&#x2019;m engaged in at this very moment.<br><br> Granted, these first hunting stories were probably not &#x201c;stories&#x201d; at all, at least not in the way we now think of that word. I imagine them more as instructions and descriptions, which is fitting, since the purpose of the vast majority of writing about hunting today is to teach readers how to do something. This &#x201c;something&#x201d; can often be quite esoteric. Maybe it&#x2019;s a technique for hunting mallard ducks over flooded corn in Iowa, or maybe it&#x2019;s an explanation of why it&#x2019;s better to sharpen the blade of your skinning knife at an angle of thirteen degrees rather than fifteen. Hunters usually call this kind of information &#x201c;how-to,&#x201d; and I have read and enjoyed a great many pieces of how-to writing in my life. But while you will find a trove of hunting tips and tricks within this book, this is not intended as how-to material. Instead, you might think of this book as why-to, who-to, and what-to. That is, this book uses the ancient art of the hunting story to answer the questions of why I hunt, who I am as a hunter, and what hunting means to me.<br><br> As I ponder the first of those questions&#x2014;why do I hunt?&#x2014;two particular moments come to mind. The first took place on a recent spring day when I was hunting turkeys in the Powder River Badlands of southeastern Montana with my brother Matt. Early that morning we left Matt&#x2019;s pack llamas, Timmy and Haggy, tethered near our camp. Matt headed south, and I went into the next valley to the west. Around late morning I started after a tom, or male turkey, that I&#x2019;d heard gobbling several hundred yards away. I followed the bird for close to an hour, only once catching a glimpse of it. He was walking fast along the edge of a sandstone cliff, maybe about thirty yards higher than me and two hundred yards out. I sat down amid a tangle of fallen timber and used a turkey call to mimic the soft clucks of a hen.<br><br> Almost as soon as I did, the tom jumped off the cliff and took flight. He flapped his wings maybe six times and soared right over my head. Turkeys are not graceful fliers; nor are they graceful landers. This one crashed through the limbs of a ponderosa pine and then thudded to the ground on the timbered slope of a deep ravine off to my left. I turned my head in that direction, so that my chin was over my left shoulder. I kept on clucking. I was hopeful that the tom would come to check on the source of the calls, but after a couple of minutes I hadn&#x2019;t seen or heard a thing. I called some more, but still nothing happened.<br><br> You have to be very careful about movement and sound when you&#x2019;re hunting turkeys, so I continued to hold dead still even though I hadn&#x2019;t heard or seen the bird since it landed. Maybe about five minutes went by without my ever turning my head away from its position over my left shoulder.<br><br> And then something strange happened. Suddenly, someone sighed very loudly just behind my right shoulder. I&#x2019;ve had coyotes and bobcats come to my turkey call, but this sigh sounded like that of an annoyed person who was slightly out of breath from running up a hill. My immediate response was to turn my head very quickly in its direction. My chin was just about to begin passing over my right shoulder when I noticed a large male black bear standing on its rear feet with its front feet propped up on a log that was leaning against the log that I was leaning against. I&#x2019;m sure he was hoping to find a nest full of turkey eggs and, if everything went well, to catch the turkey, too. Now he was staring at me with a very inquisitive look in his eye as he struggled to recalibrate his expectations.<br><br> I once heard a radio interview with a neuroscientist who studies mental processes during extremely stressful moments. He described how people in such situations will recall having dozens of distinct thoughts in the seconds that it takes for, say, a person that has fallen from a roof to hit the ground. His belief, he explained, is that we aren&#x2019;t actually having those thoughts when we think we are; rather, through a trick of memory, we just think we had them whenever we try to recall the moment. Regardless of what that guy says, I know that I had the following thoughts over the course of the next second or so: I thought about how weird it was that this bear and I both happened to be hunting turkeys in the same place at the same time; and I thought about how weird it was that I was trying to deceive a turkey in order to kill it and eat it, and how my efforts to do so had in turn deceived another creature that would have liked to have killed and eaten that turkey as well; and I wondered what effect my turkey gun, a twelve-gauge shotgun loaded with copper-coated #5 pellets, would have on a black bear at close range; and I imagined myself making a case for self-defense when I was investigated by a game warden for killing a black bear without the proper permit; and I imagined what it would be like to get mauled by a black bear; and, if I did get mauled, I imagined that it would be a very minor mauling as the bear would quickly realize that I wasn&#x2019;t what he was after; and then I thought about how black bears hardly ever mess with people; and then I imagined myself telling this story for a very long time, regardless of the actual outcome.<br><br> The bear interrupted this whirlwind litany of thoughts with a woof, like the first noise a dog might make when someone knocks at the door. He then ran off through the timber at the casual pace of a jogging human. The sound of the bear&#x2019;s running died away, and the forest returned to its usual crisp and breezy stillness. I leaned back to wait for my pulse to slow, as it was racing at a speed that I figured to be unhealthy. I sat for maybe five minutes, just breathing and thinking. I had that grateful and relieved feeling that you get when you first realize that you&#x2019;re recovering from the flu. Then I heard a turkey gobble, so far away and faint that the sound seemed more like a feeling than an actual noise. I got up to look for it, happy to be alive and walking in this wonderful and ancient world where bears sigh and turkeys gobble.<br><br> The second moment that helps answer the question of why I hunt occurred well over two thousand miles to the north of where I was hunting turkeys. I was camped on the North Slope of Alaska&#x2019;s Brooks Range, about seventy-five miles south of the Arctic Ocean&#x2019;s Beaufort Sea. I&#x2019;d been there for a week, waiting for the arrival of caribou. I hadn&#x2019;t intended to stay so long, and I was running low on food. This was worrying me just as the sound of food came by. I was lying in my sleeping bag during the first moments of morning light, and the noise I heard was a rush of wings so close to my tent that the nylon quivered. It was followed by the strange cackling of ptarmigan, a grouselike bird that is bigger than a quail but smaller than a pheasant. My brother Danny has heard their call described as go-back, go-back, go-back, but it reminds me more of Curly&#x2019;s signature laugh from the Three Stooges&#x2014;a sort of nyack-nyack-nyack.<br><br> My boots were frozen, but I pulled them on as best as I could and stepped out to a gravel bar that was crusted in frost. I dragged a rubberized duffel bag out from under my flipped-over canoe, grabbed a twenty-gauge shotgun in one hand and a handful of shells in the other, and trotted off in the direction that the birds had gone. I crossed the ice of a small pond, formed where a braid of the river had become isolated from the main channel. It was almost frozen to the bottom, and I could see a small school of sticklebacks biding their time inside a doomed world. The pond ended at a steeply eroded cut bank. I pulled myself up the ledge and then rose to my feet. I was now standing on the soft, moss-padded ground of the tundra. The birds had already molted to their white winter plumage, though there was no snow yet. This was bad for them but good for me, as I could see them running along the ground as plainly as softballs rolling across a field.</p><h2>A Country Year: Living the Questions</h2><p>Chronicles the experiences of the author who lives alone in the remote Missouri Ozarks, surviving physically by raising bees and harvesting their honey, and flourishing mentally by observing and recording nature&#39;s endlessly fascinating detail</p><p>ar is something like a baker&#39;s dozen--it contains an extra season.

Smith founded <i>Firehouse Magazine</i> and has become an outstanding spokesman for firefighters nationwide.Little boys often dream of becoming firefighters, picturing themselves as the heroes who put out fires, save lives, and rescue stranded cats. This 1972 book by Dennis Smith, author of REPORT FROM GROUND ZERO, removes the glamour, while demonstrating the challenges facing Smith and his fellow firefighters in New York City, where most alarms are false. Lloyd James sounds like a firefighter. His voice has enough roughness to convince the listener that he's ready to do battle every time the alarm bell rings; James's emotions seem to ebb and flow with the book's events. Unfortunately, this abridgment leaves the listener wondering what parts of the story are missing.

Du Bois was a historian, novelist, editor, sociologist, founder of the NAACP, advocate of women's rights, and the premier architect of the Civil Rights movement. His hypnotic voice thunders out of David Levering Lewis's monumental biography like a locomotive under full steam.<br> <br>This second volume of what is already a classic work begins with the triumphal return from WWI of African American veterans to the shattering reality of racism and lynching even as America discovers the New Negro of literature and art. In stunning detail, Lewis chronicles the little-known political agenda behind the Harlem Renaissance and Du Bois's relentless fight for equality and justice, including his steadfast refusal to allow whites to interpret the aspirations of black America. Seared by the rejection of terrified liberals and the black bourgeoisie during the Communist witch-hunts, Du Bois ended his days in uncompromising exile in newly independent Ghana. In re-creating the turbulent times in which he lived and fought, Lewis restores the inspiring and famed Du Bois to his central place in American history.<br></p><p>A pioneering sociologist, educator, essayist, activist, and political theorist, W.E.B. Du Bois was one of America's great intellectuals. This second volume by David Levering Lewis picks up where his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race</i> left off, chronicling his life from 1919 until his death in Ghana in 1963, on the eve of the March on Washington. "In the course of his long, turbulent career," Lewis writes, "W.E.B. Du Bois attempted virtually every possible solution to the problem of twentieth-century racism--scholarship, propaganda, integration, cultural and economic separatism, politics, international communism, expatriation, third world solidarity."<p> Lewis's lean and lyrical writing rescues Du Bois's stuffy, Afro-Victorian speech from historical documents, breathing life into his letters, memos, and numerous articles, both published and unpublished. He takes us through Du Bois's battles with the NAACP (which he cofounded); his ideological wars with "Back to Africa" nationalist Marcus Garvey; his many Pan-African conferences; and his tours of Africa, Japan, Russia, and China. He probes deeply into many of Du Bois's books, including <i>Darkwater: Voices from Within the Veil</i> and <i>Black Reconstruction</i>, adding marvelous new insights into the neglected novel <i>Dark Princess</i>. Lewis also details Du Bois's relationships with friends and foes alike, including James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Alain Locke, as well as his triumphs, such as his acquittal in the infamous trial in which he was accused of being an "unregistered foreign agent," and his defeats, notably his failure to publish his Encyclopedia Africana.</p><p> A foremost authority on this great man, Lewis summarizes Du Bois as having "an extraordinary mind of color in a racialized century ... possessed of a principled impatience with what he saw as the egregious failings of American democracy that drove him, decade by decade, to the paradox of defending totalitarianism in the service of a global idea of economic and social justice." A reading of this magnificent work is nothing less than a reading of modern black America. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>David Levering Lewis is the Martin Luther King Professor of History at Rutgers University and was recently awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. <i>W.E.B.

O&#x2019;Malley, SJ, provides essential historical background from the founder Ignatius of Loyola through the present. <br><br>The book tells the story of the Jesuits&#x2019; great successes as missionaries, educators, scientists, cartographers, polemicists, theologians, poets, patrons of the arts, and confessors to kings. It tells the story of their failures and of the calamity that struck them in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV suppressed them worldwide. It tells how a subsequent pope restored them to life and how they have fared to this day in virtually every country in the world. Along the way it introduces readers to key figures in Jesuit history, such as Matteo Ricci and Pedro Arrupe, and important Jesuit writings, such as the Spiritual Exercises.<br><br>Concise and compelling, The Jesuits is an accessible introduction for anyone interested in world or church history. In addition to the narrative, the book provides a timeline, a list of significant figures, photos of important figures and locations, recommendations for additional reading, and more.<br></p><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley, SJ, is a Roman Catholic priest and professor in the department of theology at Georgetown University. He is the author of a number of books, including A History of the Popes, The First Jesuits, and What Happened at Vatican II. He holds the Johannes Quasten Medal from The Catholic University of America for distinguished achievement in religious studies, and he has won numerous other awards, including best book and lifetime achievement. He is past president of the American Catholic Historical Association and the Renaissance Society of America.This book provides readers with an accessible and concise history of the Jesuit religious order. O&#x2019;Malley seeks to remove the mystery surrounding the Jesuits by making a complex and difficult history approachable and comprehensible for general readers. Often misunderstood and feared throughout history, the Jesuits have had an important religious and educational role spanning centuries and cultures. Accordingly, the author describes the impact Jesuits have had both inside and outside the Roman Catholic Church. As educators, missionaries, and scholars, the Jesuits have sought to reach every aspect of society. Though concise in his recounting, O&#x2019;Malley covers every aspect of Jesuit history, from the order's founding to the modern age. Quality and depth are not sacrificed for brevity, never leaving one feeling as if something were missing. For those wishing to know more about the subject, O&#x2019;Malley includes a helpful bibliography for further reading. This work is a clear, easy-to-read text appropriate for both students and general readers. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Perhaps no organization within the Catholic Church has been both reviled and admired as much as the Society of Jesus, whose members are known as Jesuits. O&#x2019;Malley (What Happened at Vatican II), a Jesuit priest and professor of theology at Georgetown University, is a masterful historical scholar and he knows how to tell a lively story. He divides the history into four periods, including the founding of the order; its early years; its suppression, when it was disbanded for over 70 years; and the modern and postmodern eras. The founding of Jesuit schools is an especially fascinating topic, as the establishment of educational institutions was not an original intention of Society founder Ignatius Loyola. Yet it is now what Jesuits are primarily known for worldwide. Another intriguing historical episode is the Chinese rites controversy, which pitted the Jesuits against the Dominicans in a battle over missionary tactics abroad. The Jesuits certainly made their share of enemies over the past five centuries, some of whom tried to wipe the organization out of existence. O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s book would make an excellent introductory text for anyone interested in the history of the Society of Jesus, the Catholic religious order that nurtured Pope Francis I and thousands of other great men. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>With the first-ever election of a Jesuit as pope, this most controversial of Roman Catholic orders has once again arrived center stage. Since Ignatius Loyola instituted the Society of Jesus in the sixteenth century, the Jesuits have provoked both awe and anger from both church hierarchy and secular governments. Ostensibly dedicated to the pope, the Jesuits have found themselves alternately embraced and banned by Rome. Some kings tossed Jesuits into prison and purged them from their realms, while others, notably Russia&#x2019;s Catherine the Great, embraced them. Himself a member of the order, O&#x2019;Malley emphasizes the Jesuits&#x2019; commitment to education as central to their long-term success. They started schools and universities throughout their mission fields, often inaugurating Western-style higher education in countries such as India, China, and Japan. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>O'Malley has once again written a lively and accessible historical introduction to the Society of Jesus. This slight volume serves to whet the appetite, highlighting the general arc of the organization from its founding to today. . . .This is a timely and . . . approachable introduction, especially given the election of the first Jesuit to be elected Pope. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Professor O&#x2019;Malley must be lauded for writing such a compelling, comprehensive book. It deserves a place in public and university libraries in Lutheran countries. (<i>Center for Research on Geopolitics</i>)<br><br>This volume is a must-have for libraries of all types. O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s achievement will be the new standard introduction for all audiences, particularly casual readers, seeking a gateway into the extraordinary and still-evolving legacy of the Jesuits. (<i>Catholic Library World</i>)<br><br>When Pope Francis was elected in 2013, the world witnessed an event of considerable importance for the Roman Catholic Church. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, a Jesuit, will forever be known as 'the first Jesuit pope in history!' Who better to tell their story, expelling the stigma of a tainted reputation, than a fellow Jesuit priest, John W. O&#x2019;Malley? Currently a professor of theology at Georgetown University specializing in European church history, he has written several books with his The First Jesuits winning the Philip Schaff Prize for church history. Written for a popular audience, The Jesuits dispels the mystique and enlightens readers concerning the Society of Jesus. . . .Even though the book is clearly a synopsis of the order&#x2019;s history, O&#x2019;Malley provides a valuable section following the epilogue for further reading targeting those who wish to study the subject more closely and in depth. This book would be a good choice for readers seeking to gain a cursory understanding of the Jesuits. (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>There is no one else in the world better suited to write a new history of the Jesuits than John W. O'Malley, S.J., the dean of Jesuit historians. For too long readers have lacked an accessible and comprehensive history of the Society of Jesus, and his wonderful book is well worth the wait. Highly, highly, highly recommended. (James Martin SJ, author of The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything)<br><br>The history of the Jesuits is so vast and complicated that any generalization about the is bound to be false. Yet a sure guide through the tangled particulars is the great Renaissance scholar John O'Malley. (Garry Wills, author of Lincoln at Gettysburg)<br><br>Only John W. O'Malley is today in a position to offer a sweeping scholarly yet accessible overview of the extraordinarily rich and complex history of the Society of Jesus&#x2014;from Ignatius of Loyola to Pope Francis.

His celebrated version of the Tao Te Ching is the most popular edition in print, and his translations of Jesus, Rilke, Genesis, and Job have won the hearts of readers and critics alike. Stephen Mitchell now brings to the Bhagavad Gita his gift for breathing new life into sacred texts.<br> <br>The Bhagavad Gita is universally acknowledged as one of the world's literary and spiritual masterpieces. It is the core text of the Hindu tradition and has been treasured by American writers from Emerson and Thoreau to T. S. Eliot, who called it the greatest philosophical poem after the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. There have been more than two hundred English translations of the Gita, including many competent literal versions, but not one of them is a superlative literary text in its own right.<br><br>Now all that has changed. Stephen Mitchell's <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> sings with the clarity, the vigor, and the intensity of the original Sanskrit. It will, as William Arrowsmith said of Mitchell's translation of <i>The Sonnets to Orpheus</i>, "instantly make every other rendering obsolete."</p><p>On the list of the greatest spiritual books of all time, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> resides permanently in the top echelon. This poem of patently Indian genius sprouted an immense tree of devotional, artistic, and philosophical elaboration in the subcontinent. The scene is a battlefield with the prince Arjuna pitted against his own family, but no sooner does the poem begin than the action reverts inward. Krishna, Arjuna's avatar and spiritual guide, points the way to the supreme wisdom and perfect freedom that lie within everyone's reach. Worship and be faithful, meditate and know reality--these make up the secret of life and lead eventually to the realization that the self is the root of the world. In this titular translation, Stephen Mitchell's rhythms are faultless, making music of this ancient "Song of the Blessed One." Savor his rendition, but nibble around the edges of his introduction. In a bizarre mixture of praise and condescension, Mitchell disregards two millennia of Indian commentary, seeking illumination on the text from Daoism and Zen, with the <i>Gita</i> coming up just shy of full spiritual merit. Perhaps we should take it from Gandhi, who used the Gita as a handbook for life, that it nourishes on many levels. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"Of this world-beloved, timeless classic this is the most poetic rendition."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Huston Smith</p><h2>This Little Piggy Stayed Home: A Pearls Before Swine Collection (Volume 2)</h2><p>The National Cartoonists Society nominated <i>Pearls Before Swine</i> as one of the best comic strips of 2002.<br><br><i>Pearls Before Swine</i> is an impressive comic strip success story.

The Holy Grail emerged not only as a symbol of the feminine but also as a symbol of the soul, for hidden within the sacred Grail legends lies an initiatory path that leads to the highest realms of consciousness and spiritual illumination. By working with the symbols of the Grail tradition we can gaze into our own hidden depths and heal the separation between masculine and feminine, Spirit and Matter, and Heaven and Earth. <br> <br>Mara Freeman traces the evolution of the Grail from the sacred vessel of the Celtic goddess to the Cup of Christ, revealing a spiritual path rooted in the mysteries of the Goddess, the Grail, and the Sword. She explains how the Sword has dominated over the Goddess and the Grail for far too long, leading to a spiritual wasteland as foretold in the Grail stories. She provides a practical workbook of exercises, visualizations, and magical rituals to restore the power of the divine feminine through spiritually transformative experiences with the Cauldron of Rebirth, the Chalice of Healing, the Sword of Light, and the Holy Grail itself. <br> <br>Drawing on folk traditions and medieval Arthurian romances as well as alchemy and the wisdom of the mystics of Glastonbury, Freeman reveals the ancient Celtic teachings of the Western Mystery tradition. She shows that attaining the Grail involves achieving full consciousness of the soul. Then, as a Grail-bearer, you can bring the light of the Grail into the world for the healing of self and others.</p><p>Mara Freeman has studied British and Celtic sacred traditions and mythology for more than 40 years and has presented at conferences throughout the U.S. and the U.K. since the 1990s.

Scotland Yard's Inspector Rutledge is one of many who suffer from shell shock. He constantly hears--and responds to--the voice of Hamish, a Scottish soldier he shot for cowardice. His latest case does not help his fragile state of mind as it involves another weary and discouraged veteran, Bert Mowbray.<p> On his way to Lyme Regis to search for work, Bert looks out of the train window in a town called Singleton Magna, and sees an unbelievable sight--his wife and two children who he thought were killed in a London bombing raid. He leaps off the train and tries to find his family, racing desperately across fields and country roads, and finally winding up asleep under a tree. Meanwhile, the battered body of a woman is found on the edge of a cornfield, and Mowbray is arrested. Is the woman his wife? Did he kill her? And what happened to the two children who were with her? </p><p> Everywhere Rutledge looks, he shows us various forms of damage caused by the war--from the hopes of a local girl whose lover returned with a French wife, to the trauma that Mowbray is going through. As in the first two books, <i>A Test of Wills</i> and <i>Wings of Fire</i>, Todd demonstrates the massive damage done to an entire country by focusing on the small, personal battles of the survivors. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>What the critics are saying about Charles Todd's Inspector Ian Rutledge series<p> WINGS OF FIRE<br>"Splendid imagery, in-depth characterization, and glimpses of more than one wounded psyche: an excellent historical mystery." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"The evocative seaside setting and descriptions of architecture, the moors, and the sea fully reward the attention this novel commands." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p><p>"A well-crafted mystery that will please." --<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Fine characterizations, a superb eye for Cornwall and for post-World War I attitudes, and a wise and wily exploration of how some of us deal with guilt." --Robin Winks of the <i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>"[Todd] wraps his challenging plot, complex characters, and subtle psychological insights in thick layers of atmosphere." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> A TEST OF WILLS<br>"Todd gives us a superb characterization of a man whose wounds have made him into a stranger in his own land, and a disturbing portrait of a country intolerant of all strangers." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Todd depicts the outer and inner worlds of his characters with authority and sympathy as he closes in on his surprising--and convincing--conclusion." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p><p>"The emotional and physical carnage in World War I is used to remarkable effect." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p></p><h2>Peace Kills: America&#39;s Fun New Imperialism</h2><p>One of the nation&#39;s most controversial journalists and humorists offers another hard-hitting survey of the foibles of American foreign policy, recounting his experiences among consumers in Kuwait, in security obsessed airports around the globe, and in Kosovo, where &#34;NATO tried to start World War III without hurting anyone.&#34; 100,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.</p><p>P.

His most recent book is the best seller On the Wealth of Nations.P.J. O'Rourke puts the "cur" in "curmudgeon," which is to say that he's dogged in his insistence in the futility of most human efforts. This brilliant encyclopedia of comic irony takes us from Kosovo to Iraq, and finally to Iwo Jima, where in each case we are reminded that the service of higher ideals leaves us with a still imperfect world. Dick Hill's musky reading summons the whisky-tinged professorial presence of the author in conveying the underlying warmth of a disillusioned idealist. Peace kills, but in the meantime we can enjoy the bittersweet music of this human voice.

First of all, it's a motive; the power Che Guevara was trying to invoke in his much-quoted assertion: "At the risk of appearing ridiculous . . . the true revolutionary is moved by great feelings of love." I think also of Paul Nizan: "You think you are innocent if you say, 'I love this woman and I want to act in accordance with my love,' but you are beginning the revolution. . . . You will be driven back: to claim the right to a human act is to attack the forces responsible for all the misery in the world." Neither of them, admittedly, was claiming the love of a woman for women, the love of a man for men, as revolutionary, as a human act.</p><p>But the motive is "directed by desire" in Jordan</p></p><p>June Jordan was born in Harlem in 1936. Poet, activist, teacher and essayist, she was a prolific, passionate and influential voice for liberation. She published 28 books of poetry, essays, and fiction, was a regular columnist for The Progressive and a prolific writer whose articles appeared in The Village Voice, The New York Times, Ms., Essence, the American Poetry Review, The Nation and many other periodicals.

Her poems are extraordinarily tonal, sensuous, capturing moments or ways of being which might make love - in many dimensions - more possible, more revolution - directed. -- <i>From the foreword by Adrienne Rich. June 1993.</i><br><br>June Jordan makes us think of Akhmatova, of Neruda. She is among the bravest, the most outraged. She is the universal poet. -- <i>Alice Walker</i><br><br>Never before has there been a single volume of love poetry so extraordinary in range. In Haruko/Love Poems, June Jordan expands and redefines the traditional idea of the love poem. In the first half of this volume, Jordan writes to Haruko in the style of the Neruda love poems. Taking from the haiku its purity and economy, but giving these poems a vision that is Jordan's own, the Haruko poems are at once urgent, passionate, and complex. Following the Haruko poems is a selection by Adrienne Rich and Sara Miles for 20 years of love poems that bear witness to the depth and breadth of Jordan's poetic brilliance. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Dune Encyclopedia</h2><p>The definitive companion to Frank Herbert&#39;s Dune chronicles features articles by both scholars and fans that cover diverse facets of the history, culture, religion, science, and people of Arrakis</p><p></p><h2>The Fashion Designer&#39;s Textile Directory: A Guide to Fabrics&#39; Properties, Characteristics, and Garment-Design Potential</h2><p>This valuable materials directory for professional dressmakers and fashion designers is also a good reference source for students of fashion design, as well as for those who make their own garments.

Carefully chosen text from Lewis and Cark&#39;s actual journals opens a fascinating window into this country&#39;s exciting history.</p><p>Rosalyn Schanzer is the award-winning author and illustrator of numerous books for young people. An avid photographer and Masters swimmer, she has swam with sharks in Belize, hiked through the jungles of Ecuador and in the rain forests of the Amazon River basin, investigated Inca history at Machu Picchu, climbed the Andes, and helped sail a famous boat from Bermuda to Boston. She lives in Virginia with her husband and when not painting or researching her next book, Roz is available for school visits. To learn more about Rosalyn Schanzer, visit www.rosalynschanzer.comA simplified version of the diaries of Lewis and Clark; in an introduction, Schanzer explains how she condensed much of the excitement and adventure of the 40 volumes into this one. The book follows the route mapped out on the end papers, beginning with President Jefferson's request that the two explore the west, and ending when Lewis and Clark return two years later to St. Charles (near St. Louis), long after everyone thought they'd died. In that time the two men discovered many new animals and plants, met with Indian tribes, and created new maps of the uncharted territories. Schanzer often breaks up the page into a series of vignettes with captions, effectively covering many of their experiences in a small space. Her drawings include portraits of the members of the expedition and other details that make an already authentic text all the richer.

Intensely private and completely secluded, the president's personal campground is situated deep in the woods, up miles of unmarked roads that are practically invisible to the untrained eye. Now, for the first time, we are allowed to travel along the mountain route and directly into the fascinating and intimate complex of rustic residential cabins, wildlife trails, and athletic courses that make up the presidential family room. <br><br>For seventy-five years, Camp David has served as the president's private retreat. A home away from the hustle and bustle of Washington, this historic site is the ideal place for the First Family to relax, unwind, and, perhaps most important, escape from the incessant gaze of the media and the public. It has hosted decades of family gatherings for thirteen presidents, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama, including holiday celebrations, reunions, and even a wedding. But more than just a weekend getaway, Camp David has also been the site of private meetings and high-level summits with foreign leaders to foster diplomacy. <br><br>Former Camp David commander Rear Admiral Michael Giorgione, CEC, USN (Ret.), takes us deep into this enigmatic and revered sanctuary. Combining fascinating first-person anecdotes of the presidents and their families with storied history and interviews with commanders both past and present, he reveals the intimate connection felt by the First Families with this historic retreat. <br></p><p><b>Rear Admiral Michael Giorgione, CEC, USN (Ret.) </b>has served a total of 29 years on active duty in the United States Navy and four years at the Naval Academy, retiring in 2010.

Coming in the wake of the Gulf War, the Intifada, the Pollard espionage debacle, and the Bush Administration's somewhat revisionist attitude toward Israel, the authors' study is more than timely. Beginning with a brief, unsentimental version of Israeli history that has little in common with the establishment line, the two outline the forces, attitudes, and personalities that shaped the creation of that country and its formidable intelligence service, Mossad. From this grows the carefully crafted thesis that Mossad's most significant achievement has been the development of an enduring entente with the US via intelligence rather than conventional channels, the whole conceived by the legendary Reuven Shiloah and accepted by David Ben-Gurion. The authors also contend that rather than avoid the use of diaspora Jews in the gathering of intelligence, Mossad has heavily and successfully relied on them, as in the case of the Pollards. The direct connection between the Lehi terrorist group, the assassination of Count Bernadotte (instrumental in getting Jews out of Europe in WW II), and Shamir is explicated in detail, along with an Israeli entrepreneur's involvement in supplying Chinese ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. Current Israeli cat's-paw activities on behalf of the CIA and involvement in US domestic affairs, including presidential elections, are also revealed, with somewhat less perspective. This is no thrown-together post-Gulf product, but an unflinching, fact-packed, closely reasoned exploration of our relations with our strongest ally in the Middle East. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In fact, running arms, stealing nuclear material from the United States, assisting African leaders the likes of Idi Amin, training Medellin hit squads, and testing atomic weapons for South Africa appear to be common "services rendered" by Mossad &amp; Company. For strategic purposes, David Ben-Gurion tied Israel's intelligence operations to CIA shirttails, which has led both countries into unbelievable circumstances. The primary lubricant to the widespread involvement of Israeli agents in everybody's business, according to the authors, is the arms business, which brings billions of dollars annually to the country and those who control the intelligence operations. This is a pragmatic look at what Israel (and its partner, the United States) have been up to since the 1950s--as opposed to how they do what they do so well (see Ian Black and Benny Morris's Israel's Secret Wars , LJ 6/1/91).

If you can fight past an initial uncertainty about the identity of its narrators, you may find that it&#x2019;s the best thing you&#x2019;ve read in years. This first novel by acclaimed short-story-writer and essayist George Saunders (<em>Tenth of December</em>, <em>The Brain-Dead Megaphone</em>) will upend your expectations of what a novel should be. Saunders has said that &#x201c;Lincoln in the Bardo&#x201d; began as a play, and that sense of a drama gradually revealing itself through disparate voices remains in the work&#x2019;s final form. </p> <p>The year is 1862. President Lincoln, already tormented by the knowledge that he&#x2019;s responsible for the deaths of thousands of young men on the battlefields of the Civil War, loses his beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, to typhoid. The plot begins after Willie is laid to rest in a cemetery near the White House, where, invisible to the living, ghosts linger, unwilling to relinquish this world for the next. Their bantering conversation, much of it concerned with earthly -- and earthy &#x2013; pleasures, counterbalances Lincoln&#x2019;s abject sorrow. </p> Saunders takes huge risks in this novel, and they pay off. His writing is virtuosic &#x2013; and best of all, its highs and lows are profoundly entertaining. You may hear echoes of Thornton Wilder, Beckett and even a little Chaucer, but <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> is peculiar and perfect unto itself. Some advice: don&#x2019;t try to read this one in a library. You&#x2019;ll be hooting with laughter when you aren&#x2019;t wiping away your tears. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>George Saunders is the author of nine books, including Lincoln in the Bardo, winner of the 2017 Man Booker Prize.

It might have been when he found himself considering a purchase of men's dress socks with cartoon characters on them.

She watched as Hitler rolled into Poland, then France, and she decided to work for the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). There she learned things her wealthy Baltimore contemporaries would never have imagined--demolitions, assassination, secret radio communications, and resistance organization. She was deployed to France where the Gestapo imprisoned, beat, and tortured spies. Some were mercifully executed while others faced slow, painful deaths.<br><br>Against such an ominous backdrop, Hall managed to locate drop zones for the money and weapons so badly needed by the French Resistance, helped escaped POWs and downed Allied airmen flee to England, and secured safe houses for agents in need. Soon, wanted posters appeared throughout France offering a reward for the capture of "The most dangerous of all Allied spies . . . we must find and destroy her." By winter of 1942 Hall had no choice but to flee France via the only route possible: a hike on foot through the frozen Pyr?9n?9s Mountains into neutral Spain. The escape was arduous, and Hall''s artificial leg (nicknamed "Cuthbert") became very painful. In a radio message to London during the journey, she mentioned that Cuthbert was giving her trouble. Forgetting her leg''s nickname, London replied, "If Cuthbert is giving you trouble, have him eliminated." <br><br>Upon her return to England, the OSS recruited her and sent her back to France in the spring of 1944 disguised as an old peasant woman.

Far too frequently, patients leave the doctor's office or hospital feeling confused, angry, or neglected. Healthcare leaders recognize this problem, but in their focus on patients (and sometimes financials), they often overlook the true key to lasting patient loyalty and satisfaction: their employees. <br><br><i>Patients Come Second</i> shakes up the traditional healthcare model, arguing that in order to care for and retain patients, leaders must first create exceptional teams and find ways to engage nurses, administrative staff, physicians, supervisors, and even housekeeping staff and switchboard operators. By connecting employees' work with a higher purpose and equipping them with the tools to become leaders themselves, patient care can be dramatically transformed. And with continuing healthcare changes on the horizon and ever-rising pressure to acquire and keep patients, doing so now is more important than ever. <br><br>Britt Berrett, president of an 898-bed hospital, and Paul Spiegelman, founder and CEO of a successful patient-experience company, are the perfect guides to the changes needed in healthcare leadership. With a rich combined experience in their field, they have filled each chapter with an abundance of engaging, insightful stories and write with a humor and friendliness that balances and enhances the urgency of their message.</p><p>No business can effectively take care of its customers before it takes care of its employees. Health care is no different--and that&#39;s why patients have to come second.Paul Spiegelman is founder and CEO of The Beryl Companies, which includes--among others--BerylHealth, a technology-focused patient experience company, and The Circle, a training company that helps businesses enhance employee engagement.

He is a sought-after speaker and author on executive leadership, corporate culture, and employee engagement. His views have been published in Entrepreneur, the Dallas Morning News, Inc., and many other publications. <br><br>Britt Berrett, a passionate advocate for excellence in healthcare, serves as president of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where, he oversees strategic planning and operations, guiding the hospital in its mission to improve the health of the people in the community it serves. In 2007 U.S. News and World Report recognized Texas Health Dallas as a best hospital in the digestive disorders, orthopedics, and neurology and neurosurgery specialties.

He is a native of Georgia and began his writing career in the advertising industry. <i>Chiefs</i>, his debut in 1981, won the Edgar Award. An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New Mexico.1<br><br> Teddy Fay stared into the smog-filtered rising sun and set his speed control to seventy-five miles per hour. The road seemed for a moment to rise into the flaming ball, then, as he crested what passed for a hill, it fell back into its proper place. He reached into the center armrest, fumbled for his Ray-Bans and put them on. No need to drill a hole into his corneas.<br><br> Teddy, who for some time had been called Billy Barnett, had done all the right things. He had identified his wife's body in the morgue, though he had winced at her injuries. The instrument of her death had been a huge SUV, driven down Rodeo Drive at an incomprehensible speed by a woman who had, reportedly, just finished a three-cosmo lunch with some friends. His wife's only participation had been to go shopping and to cross with the light in her favor. She had been the definition of innocence, and her killer had been the definition of murderer. Apparently, as he'd been told by police, the woman was the wife of one of Hollywood's most famous producers, who specialized in the kind of mayhem inflicted by his spouse on that sunny, sunny L.A. day.<br><br> Teddy Fay had done the right thing. He had engaged an undertaker, sat through a well-attended memorial service, and scattered her ashes in the surf at Malibu Beach in front of their house, a place she had loved. He had asked Peter Barrington, for whom he worked, to be relieved of his duties on a film he was scheduled to produce, and had been told to take all the time he needed. She would be missed, he had been told, having been the heart and soul of the business side of the production company and a fixture at Centurion Studios.<br><br> Teddy had then packed a couple of bags, tossed them into the rear of his new Porsche Cayenne Turbo, which had, seemingly of its own accord, found its way onto I-40, pointed east, toward Oklahoma City. The car may have known the way, but Teddy had no idea where he was going.<br><br> An hour after sunrise, Teddy surprised himself by feeling hungry. He had not eaten for nearly two days. He got off the interstate and found a small-town diner-he didn't know which town-and ate a big breakfast. He gassed up and got back onto I-40. He passed exits to places with familiar names, but none of them had any life for him.<br><br> He spent the night in a motel and continued at dawn the next day. He was in the western outskirts of Albuquerque when he saw a sign for Santa Fe. The name resonated for Teddy; he had visited, even lived there when he had been on the run from most of the law and intelligence services in the United States. He took I-25 north. It might be a nicer place since he had been presidentially pardoned for his many sins-more than the President knew about, but all covered.<br><br> He was at five thousand feet of elevation at Albuquerque, the same as Denver, the Mile-High City, and as he drove north the landscape rose before him, until his GPS told him he was nearing seven thousand feet. He knew the name of a hotel there: the Inn of the Anasazi. He had always liked the name, and now he phoned ahead for accommodations. He noted several calls received on his iPhone, but the ringer had been off, and he didn't feel like returning them.<br><br> He lay staring at the beamed ceiling for a long time before he fell asleep.<br><br> Stone Barrington was at his desk in his home office in New York when Joan, his secretary, buzzed him. �Your son is on line one.�<br><br> They normally talked once a week, and it had only been three or four days since their last conversation, so Stone was immediately worried. He picked up the phone. "Peter?"<br><br> "Hello, Dad."<br><br> "You sound sad. Is anything wrong?"<br><br> "It's Billy Barnett," Peter said.<br><br> "Is he ill?"<br><br> "No, his wife was run down and killed by a drunk driver in Beverly Hills a few days ago, and now he's missing."<br><br> "I'm very sorry to hear that. I liked her. What do you mean, 'missing'?"<br><br> "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound ominous. I just mean that he asked for some time off, and I haven't been able to reach him since. I went out to his house in Malibu this morning. His car was gone, and the place was locked up."<br><br> "Somehow, that doesn't surprise me," Stone said. "Billy was a loner before he married, so maybe he just wants to be alone again for a while."<br><br> "But Billy has become more gregarious over the past few years, in his quiet way, of course. I wouldn't have expected him to just walk away from everyone he knows here."<br><br> "Peter, people don't always do what you expect them to, even when you think you know them well. Give him a while, then try calling him again, or just send him a text saying that you're thinking about him and you hope to hear from him soon."<br><br> "You're right, that's what I should do."<br><br> "When you hear from him tell him he's in my thoughts, and if he finds his way to New York he's welcome at my house."<br><br> "I'll do that, Dad." They said goodbye and hung up.<br><br> Teddy awoke late and had breakfast. As noon approached he thought he�d take a stroll around the Plaza, which was a few steps from the inn. He passed through the large group of Indian craftspeople selling their silver jewelry under the portico of the old Governor�s Mansion and immediately thought of buying something for his wife but brought himself up short. He forced himself to walk on.<br><br> He was approaching some sort of commercial building when a familiar figure suddenly appeared a few yards ahead, leaving its front door. The figure was unmistakable, since he was something like six feet, eight inches tall and, further, wore a large Western hat that added another half a foot to his height. Teddy walked a little faster to catch up.<br><br> Then he saw a second man, and there was something furtive in his posture and movement. He had fallen into step behind the tall man, and there was something in his right hand, bumping against his leg.<br><br> "Ed!" Teddy shouted. Then louder, as he began to run. "Ed Eagle!"<br><br> Eagle turned and looked over his left shoulder but didn't stop, missing sight of the man, who was behind and to his right.<br><br> Teddy lunged at the man, striking him in the lower back with his forearm and knocking him to the ground. Teddy was climbing the man's back, reaching for the wrist of the hand that held the long blade, when Eagle turned around and, seeing what had happened, stomped on the wrist and kicked the knife away.<br><br> "Billy?" Eagle said. "Jesus Christ, what's going on?"<br><br> Teddy had the man's left arm behind his back, his wrist shoved up between his shoulder blades.<br><br> "I think you'd better ask this guy," he said to Eagle, "but maybe you'd better call a cop first."<br><br> 2<br><br> Teddy sat at the dining table in Ed Eagle's home, with Ed and his wife, the actress and writer Susannah Wilde, as well. The business on the sidewalk outside Eagle's offices had been handled with dispatch by the Santa Fe police, and both Ed and Teddy had given statements.<br><br> "I'm sorry to hear about your wife's death," Eagle said.<br><br> "Thank you, Ed," Teddy replied, "I was sorry to hear about it myself."<br><br> "Of course. What brings you to Santa Fe?"<br><br> "Four wheels and a wandering nature," Teddy replied. "For some reason I suddenly craved the open road."<br><br> "I'm glad it brought you our way," Ed said. "Otherwise, I might be on a slab down at the morgue."<br><br> "I didn't get a chance to ask you," Teddy said, "who was the guy, and what was his beef?"<br><br> "His name is Sanchez, and his beef was that I talked his brother into taking a plea bargain of thirty years, instead of what would almost certainly have been the death penalty. Now his brother will be out in fifteen years or so, and the other Mr. Sanchez, the one with the sword, will likely be serving life, since he opposes plea bargains."<br><br> "It was a sword?"<br><br> "A Roman sword, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. Last year Mr. Sanchez was an extra in a sword and sandal opus being shot somewhere out in the hills, and the company went back to L.A. one sword short. Except for you, they would have located it between my shoulder blades."<br><br> "I'm glad I was there," Teddy said.<br><br> "I'm glad you were, too," Susannah offered. "Mind you, I've occasionally been tempted to do much the same thing to Ed with a steak knife, but I must have a bit more personal restraint than Mr. Sanchez."<br><br> Everybody laughed.<br><br> "If I'd known you were here," Ed said, "you'd be occupying our guesthouse instead of the inn. It's not too late to make the move. We'd be delighted to have you."<br><br> "Thank you, Ed, but I think I'll move on in a day or two, so I won't trouble you."<br><br> "Do you have a destination in mind?" Ed said.<br><br> "Not yet."<br><br> "Do you intend to pursue justice with Mrs. Dax Baxter?"<br><br> "She's Dax Baxter's wife? I didn't know. In any case, I'll let the law have its way with her."<br><br> "I've made a couple of calls to L.A., and I'm afraid the law appears to have lost interest in Mrs. Baxter," Ed said. "She was unconscious when the police arrived at the scene and she was taken to a hospital. Before she could be admitted or even regained consciousness, she had been moved to a private clinic, where she had previously been treated for drug and alcohol abuse, and by the time the police got access, her bloodstream was clear of any substance. Mr. Baxter has hired a very competent attorney, one Rex Winston, to represent her, and I'm afraid that by the time the district attorney has completed his investigation, Mrs. Baxter will have been found to have had a small stroke while driving and was already unconscious at the time of the accident."<br><br> "So she will just walk away from killing another human being?" Teddy asked incredulously.<br><br> "That seems very likely," Ed said. "Dax Baxter is well acquainted with the wheels upon which his city rolls and knows how and which ones to lubricate."<br><br> "Then perhaps I should consider a civil suit?"<br><br> "Perhaps, but you should know that Mrs. Baxter, in her previous incarnation as Willa Mather, was a well-regarded actress, until her husband decided, given her history of substance abuse, that she should confine her career to red-carpet appearances in his company. She would probably regard taking the stand in her own defense as an opportunity for a comeback, and she would be a formidable witness."<br><br> Teddy nodded. "I remember her work, and I tend to agree with your opinion of her."<br><br> "I'm sorry I can't be more encouraging, Billy."<br><br> Susannah spoke up. "Or," she said, "you could just shoot them both in the head."<br><br> Ed smiled. "I'm afraid my wife, though she is a brilliant actress, a fine screenwriter, and an ace producer and director, would make a poor attorney. She lacks the patience."<br><br> "Tell me, Ed," Susannah said sweetly, "how would patience improve Billy's situation?"<br><br> Ed shrugged. "Improvement can be hard to come by, but patience is time, and time, though it may not heal all wounds, heals some of them and usually ameliorates the rest."<br><br> "My husband is so wise," Susannah said with a smile.<br><br> "I appreciate both your points of view," Teddy said, "though perhaps not equally."<br><br> The following morning Ed Eagle made a phone call east, where it was two hours later.<br><br> "Stone Barrington."<br><br> "Hello, Stone, it's Ed Eagle."<br><br> "Ed! How are you?"<br><br> "I'm very well, thanks to a friend of yours."<br><br> "Who and why?"<br><br> "Billy Barnett, as he is now known, and he saved me from having a long piece of sharp steel driven into my back." Ed filled in the details.<br><br> "You are a very fortunate man to have that man come along at just the right moment."<br><br> "I am very aware of that," Ed said, "but I'm worried about Billy."<br><br> "I heard from Peter what happened to his wife."<br><br> "Perhaps you haven't heard what's happened since?"<br><br> "Please tell me."<br><br> Ed brought him up to date.<br><br> "Well," Stone said, "I tend to think that Billy would be more inclined to take Susannah's advice over yours."<br><br> "That had crossed my mind. Stone, it's been a while since you've visited me in Santa Fe. I think the news that you were coming might cause Billy to stay on for a bit, and perhaps together we might slow him down, or perhaps even keep him out of prison."<br><br> "Have I ever told you how Billy saved the lives of my son, Peter, and Dino's son, Ben?"<br><br> "No."<br><br> "Then I'll tell you over dinner tonight," Stone said. "Sit on Billy until I get there."<br><br> "Call me an hour out, and I'll meet you at the airport."<br><br> "See you then." Both men hung up.<br><br> Stone buzzed Joan.<br><br> "Yes, boss?"<br><br> "Please call Jet Aviation at Teterboro and ask them to have my airplane on the ramp in an hour, fueled to the gills, and cancel anything I might have on the books for the next week. And ask Fred to have the car out in fifteen minutes."<br><br> "May I ask where you're going?"<br><br> "To Santa Fe. A little vacation."<br><br> "Consider it done."<br><br> Stone hung up and went upstairs to pack.<br><br> 3<br><br> As Stone touched down at Santa Fe Airport and rolled out, he saw an unfamiliar SUV parked on the ramp. He taxied in and was directed to a parking spot near the car, where Ed Eagle was leaning against it.<br><br> Stone shut down, waited for chocks, then went down the boarding ladder and closed and locked the cabin door behind him.<br><br> Ed took Stone's hand in his more massive one. "I'm glad to see you," he said.<br><br> "What's this?" Stone asked, indicating the car.<br><br> "It's the new Bentley Bentayga," Ed replied. "First one in Santa Fe."<br><br> "What does Bentayga mean?"<br><br> "I've no idea. I'm not sure that Bentley does."<br><br> A lineman put Stone's luggage into the trunk, and both men got into the car.<br><br> "Very nice," Stone said, fondling the quilted leather upholstery.<br><br> "Lots of legroom," Ed replied. "A personal requirement." He started the car and was let out of the gate.<br><br> "How's Billy?"<br><br> "Placid, on the surface. Boiling underneath and deeply, deeply depressed."<br><br> "That's a dangerous combination with someone like Billy," Stone observed. "What can we do about it?"<br><br> "I don't know-a woman?"<br><br> "I think, at this stage, that would be both inappropriate and unadvisable."</p><h2>How to See, How to Draw: Keys to Realistic Drawing</h2><p><p>Imagine having the ability to draw any subject with precision, detail and expression.

Ward</b> is the author of more than twenty previous novels, including those in her #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, The Black Dagger Brotherhood. She is also the author of the Black Dagger Legacy series, and <i>The Bourbon Kings</i>. There are more than fifteen million copies of Ward&#x2019;s novels in print worldwide, and they have been published in twenty-five different countries around the world.One <br><br>Brownswick School for Girls, Caldwell, New York<br><br>Ants under the skin.<br><br>As Rhage transferred his weight from one shitkicker to the other, he felt like his bloodstream had come to a soft boil and the bubbles were tickling the underside of every fucking square inch of his flesh. And that wasn&#x2019;t the half of it. Random muscle fibers misfired all over his body, the spasms causing fingers to twitch, knees to jerk, shoulders to tighten like he was about to go tennis racket on something.<br><br>For the one millionth time since he&#x2019;d materialized into his position, he peeper-swept the ragged, overgrown&nbsp;meadow up ahead. Back when the Brownswick School for Girls had been a functioning entity, the field in front of him had no doubt been a rolling lawn that had been well mowed in the spring and summer, de-leafed in the autumn, and snow-�covered pretty as a children&#x2019;s book in the winter. Now, it was a touch-football field from hell, studded and tangled with gnarled bushes that could do more than just aesthetic damage to a guy&#x2019;s crotchticular region, saplings that were the ugly, misshapen stepchildren of the more mature maples and oaks, and late-October brown long grass that could trip you like a little bitch if you were trying to sprint.<br><br>Likewise, the brick buildings, which had sheltered and provided living and instructional spaces to the privileged elite&#x2019;s offspring, were aging badly without regular maintenance: windows broken, doors rotting, off-kilter shutters opening and shutting in the cold wind as if the ghosts couldn&#x2019;t decide whether they wanted to be seen or just heard.<br><br>It was the campus from <i>Dead Poets Society</i>. Assuming everyone had packed up after the movie had been shot in 1988 and nobody had touched a fucking thing since.<br><br>But the facilities were not empty.<br><br>As Rhage took a deep inhale, his gag reflex did a couple of push-ups in the back of his throat. So many <i>lessers</i> were hiding in the abandoned dormitories and classrooms that&nbsp;it was impossible to isolate individual scents from the sinus-�numbing stench of the whole. Christ, it was like putting your face in a chum bucket and inhaling like the world was about to run out of oxygen.<br><br>Assuming someone had added baby powder to all the day-old fish heads and goo.<br><br>For that sweet finish, don&#x2019;tcha know.<br><br>As his skin went on another shimmy-shimmy, he told his curse to hold its hey-nannies, that hell yeah, it was going to get let off the chain ASAP. He wasn&#x2019;t even going to attempt to hold the damn thing in&#x2014;not that trying to throw the brakes on it was ever successful, anyway&#x2014;and whereas giving the beast free rein was not always a good thing, tonight it was going to be an offensive bene. The Black Dagger Brotherhood was facing how many <i>lessers</i>? Fifty? A hundred and fifty?<br><br>That was a lot to handle, even for them&#x2014;so yeah, his little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. present&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the Scribe Virgin was going to come in handy.<br><br>Talk about your ringer from out of town. Over a century ago, the mother of the race had given him his own personal T.O. system, a behavior modification program that was so onerous, so unpleasant, so overwhelming that it did, in fact, manage to bring him back from the brink of total douche-baggery. Courtesy of the dragon, unless he managed his energy levels properly and moderated his emotions, all hell broke loose.<br><br>Literally.<br><br>Yup, in the course of the last century, he had become largely successful at making sure the thing didn&#x2019;t eat his nearest and dearest, or get them on the nightly news with a &#x201c;<i>Jurassic Park</i> Is Alive&#x201d; headline. But with what he and his brothers were facing right now&#x2014;and how isolated this campus was? If they were lucky, the great purple-scaled bastard with the chain-saw teeth and the hollow-legged hangry was going to get his Nobu on. Although, again, a <i>lesser</i>-only diet was what they were looking for.<br><br>No brothers as Hot Pockets, please. And no humans as tapas or dessert, thank you very much.<br><br>The latter was more out of discretion than affection. Shit knew those rats without tails never went anywhere without two things: a half dozen of their evolutionarily inferior, nocturnally codependent, fuck-twit buddies, and their goddamn cell phones. Man, YouTube was a total pain in the ass when you wanted to keep your war with the undead under wraps. For nearly two thousand years, vampires fighting the Omega&#x2019;s Lessening Society had been no one else&#x2019;s business except for the combatants involved, and the fact that humans couldn&#x2019;t stick to their core competencies of ruining the environment and telling each other what to think and say was only one of the reasons he hated them.<br><br>Fucking Internet.<br><br>Changing gears so he didn&#x2019;t get loose too soon, Rhage GoPro&#x2019;d his vision to a male taking cover about twenty feet&nbsp;away from him. Assail, son of Whoever-the-Fuck, was dressed in funeral-cortege black, his Dracula-dark hair requiring no camouflage, his handsome-as-sin face furrowed so tight with murder that you had to respect the guy. Talk about doing a solid&#x2014;and a one-eighty. The drug dealer had come through for the Brotherhood, making good on his promise to cut business ties with the Lessening Society by delivering the <i>Fore-lesser&#x2019;s</i> head in a box to Wrath&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>And also divulging the location of this bolt-hole the slayers had been using as HQ.<br><br>Which was how everyone had ended up here, up to their nuts in the overgrowth, waiting for the countdown on their V-synchronized watches to hit 0:00.<br><br>This attack wasn&#x2019;t some bullshit, buckshot approach to the enemy. After a number of nights&#x2014;and days, thanks to Lassiter, a.k.a. 00-a-hole, having done recon during sunshine hours&#x2014;the attack was properly coordinated, staged, and ready for execution. All of the fighters were here: Z and Phury, Butch and V, Tohr and John Matthew, Qhuinn and Blay, as well as Assail and his two cousins, Fang I and II.<br><br>&#x2019;Cuz who cared what their names were as long as they showed up weaponized with plenty of ammo.<br><br>The Brotherhood medical personnel were also on standby in the area, with Manny in his mobile surgical unit about a&nbsp;mile away and Jane and Ehlena in one of the vans at a two-mile radius.<br><br>Rhage checked his watch. Six minutes and change.<br><br>As his left eye started to do the stanky leg, he cursed. How the fuck was he going to hold his position for that long?<br><br>Baring his fangs, he exhaled through his nose, blowing out twin streams of condensed breath that were nothing short of a bull&#x2019;s charging notice.<br><br>Christ, he couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time he was this juiced. And he didn&#x2019;t want to think about the why of it. In fact, he&#x2019;d been avoiding the whole <i>why</i> thing for how long?<br><br>Well, since he and Mary had hit this strange rough spot and he&#x2019;d started to feel&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Rhage.&#x201d;<br><br>His name was whispered so softly he wrenched around, because he wasn&#x2019;t sure whether or not his subconscious had decided to start talking to him. Nope. It was Vishous&#x2014;and given his brother&#x2019;s expression, Rhage would have preferred to be pulling a split-personality on himself. Those diamond eyes were flashing with a bad light. And those&nbsp;tattoos around that temple were so not helping.&nbsp;<br><br>The goatee was a neutral&#x2014;unless you assessed it on style. In which case the fucker was a travesty of Rogaine proportions.<br><br>Rhage shook his head. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you get into �position&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen this night.&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, hell, no, Rhage thought. Nope, you are not doing this to me right now, my brother.<br><br>Turning away, he muttered, &#x201c;Spare me the Vincent Price, &#x2019;kay? Or are you trying for the guy who does the movie trailer voice-overs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rhage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;&#x2019;cuz you got a future in that. &#x2018;In a world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where people need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to shut up and do their jobs&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Rhage</i>.<i>&#x201d;</i><br><br>When he didn&#x2019;t look back, V came around and glared up at him, those fucking pale eyes a twin set of nuclear blasts that spelled mushroom cloud forward and backward. &#x201c;I want you to go home. <i>Now</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhage opened his mouth. Clapped it shut. Opened it again&#x2014;and had to remind himself to keep his voice down. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s not a good time for your one-eight-hundred psychic headquarters shit&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The Brother snapped a hold on his arm and squeezed. &#x201c;<i>Go home</i>. I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> fucking you.&#x201d;<br><br>Cold terror washed through Rhage&#x2019;s veins, bottoming out his body temperature&#x2014;and yet he shook his head again. &#x201c;Fuck off, Vishous. <i>Seriously</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>He was so not interested in testing out any more of the Scribe Virgin&#x2019;s magic. He wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br><br><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to fucking die tonight.&#x201d;</i><br><br>As Rhage&#x2019;s heart stopped, he stared down into that face that he&#x2019;d known for so many years, tracing those tattoos, and the tight lips, and the slashing black brows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the radiant intelligence that was usually expressed through a filter of samurai-sword sarcasm.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mother gave me her word,&#x201d; Rhage said. Wait, was he actually talking about him kicking it? &#x201c;She promised that when I die, Mary can come with me unto the Fade. Your mother said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck my mother. <i>Go home</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhage looked away because he had to. It was either that or have his head explode. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving the Brothers. Ain&#x2019;t going to happen. You could be wrong, for one thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Yeah, and when was the last time that had happened? Eighteen hundreds? Seventeen hundreds?<br><br>Never?<br><br>He spoke over V. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m also not going to run scared from the Fade. I start thinking like that, and I&#x2019;m finished with a weapon in my hand.&#x201d; He put his palm all up in that goatee so the Brother cut the interrupting. &#x201c;And the third fuck-off? If I don&#x2019;t fight tonight, I&#x2019;m not going to make it through the day locked in the mansion&#x2014;not without my purple friend coming out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you feel me?&#x201d;<br><br>Well, and there was a number four, too. And the fourth rationale&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was bad, so very bad that he couldn&#x2019;t entertain it for more than the split second required for the piece of shit to come to mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Rhage&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s going to wreck me. I got this&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; V hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, fine,&#x201d; Rhage bit out as he tilted forward on his hips. &#x201c;So what if I die? Your mother gave my Mary the ultimate grace. If I go unto the Fade, Mary just meets me there. I don&#x2019;t have to worry about ever being separated from her. She and I will be perfectly fine. Who really fucking cares if I kick it?&#x201d;<br><br>V did some lean-in of his own. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think the Brothers will give a shit? Really? Thanks, asshole.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhage checked his watch. Two minutes to go.<br><br>Might as well be two thousand years.<br><br>&#x201c;And you trust my mother,&#x201d; V sneered, &#x201c;with something that important. I never thought you were naive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She managed to give me a fucking T. rex alter ego! That&#x2019;s some good fucking credibility.&#x201d;<br><br>All at once, a number of birdcalls sounded out around them in the darkness. If you hadn&#x2019;t known better, you&#x2019;d have assumed it was just a bunch of night owls going <i>Pitch Perfect</i>.<br><br>Damn it, the pair of them were yelling over here.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever, V,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so goddamn smart, worry about your own life.&#x201d;<br><br>His last conscious thought, before his brain went <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> and nothing else registered outside of the aggression, was of his Mary.<br><br>He pictured the last time they&#x2019;d been alone.<br><br>It was a ritual of his before he engaged with the enemy, a mental talisman that he rubbed for luck, and tonight he saw her as she had stood in front of the mirror in their bedroom, the one that was over the tall bureau where they kept their watches and their keys, her jewelry and his Tootsie Pops, their phones.<br><br>She was up on her tiptoes, angled over the top, trying to put a pearl stud into her earlobe and missing the hole. With her head tilted to the side, her deep brown hair flowed over her shoulder and made him want to put his face into the freshly shampooed waves. And that wasn&#x2019;t the half of what impressed him. The clean cut of her jaw caught and held the light from the crystal sconce on the wall, and her cream silk blouse draped over her breasts and was tucked into her tight waist, and her slacks fell to her flats. No makeup on her. No perfume.<br><br>But that would be like touching up the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or hitting a rosebush with a shot of Febreze.<br><br>There were a hundred thousand ways to detail his mate&#x2019;s physical attributes, and not one single sentence, or indeed an entire book, that could come close to describing her presence.<br><br>She was the watch on his wrist, the roast beef when he was starving, and the pitcher of lemonade when he was thirsty. She was his chapel and his choir, the mountain range to his wanderlust, the library for his curiosity, and every sunrise or sunset that ever was or would ever be. With one look or the mere syllable of a word, she had the power to transform his mood, giving him flight even as his feet stayed on the ground. With a single touch, she could chain his inner dragon, or make him come even before he got hard. She was all the power in the universe coalesced into a living, breathing thing, the miracle that he had been granted in spite of the fact that he had long been undeserving of anything but his curse.<br><br>Mary Madonna Luce was the virgin Vishous had told him was coming for him&#x2014;and she was more than enough to turn him into a God-fearing vampire.<br><br>On that note&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>Rhage took off without waiting for the Go Now from his team. Rushing headlong across the field, he had both guns up in front of him and premium, high-test gas funneling into his leg muscles. And no, he didn&#x2019;t have to hear the precise curses of frustration as he blew their cover and started the attack too soon.<br><br>He was used to the boys being pissed off at him.<br><br>And his demons were way harder to deal with than his brothers.<br><br>Safe Place, Mary&#x2019;s Office<br><br>As Mary Madonna Luce hung up the phone, she kept her hand on the receiver&#x2019;s smooth grip. Like a lot of the equipment and furnishings at Safe Place, the set was a decade old, a used AT&amp;T leftover from some insurance company or maybe a real estate agent&#x2019;s upgrade. Same with the desk. Her chair. Even the rug under her feet. At the vampire race&#x2019;s only domestic violence shelter and resource for females and their children, every penny that came from the King&#x2019;s generous coffers was spent on the people receiving support, treatment, and rehabilitation.<br><br>Victims were allowed to come free of charge. And stay in the large, roomy house for however long they needed to.<br><br>Staffing, of course, was the largest expense&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and with news like what had just come through that old phone, Mary was really fricking grateful for Marissa&#x2019;s priorities.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck you, death,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Fuck you so goddamn hard.&#x201d;</p><h2>Losing It: And Gaining My Life Back One Pound at a Time</h2><p>The actress recalls the challenges of maintaining a healthy self-image while coping with the stress of celebrity, her twenty-year marriage to rock star Eddie Van Halen, her battle with depression and weight, motherhood, and her determination to take control of her own life.</p><p><b>A Note to Amazon Readers (and a Q&amp;A) from Valerie Bertinelli</b> <p></p> Dear Amazon Customer, <p></p> Glad to see you here and hopefully purchasing my book.

Some introductions to the New Testament highlight the historical contexts in which the New Testament literature was written. This introduction gives particular attention to the social, cultural and rhetorical contexts of the New Testament authors and their writings. Few introductions to the New Testament integrate instruction in exegetical and interpretive strategies with their customary considerations of authorship, dating, audience and message. This introduction capitalizes on the opportunities, introducing students to a relevant facet of interpretation with each portion of New Testament literature. Rarely do introductions to the New Testament approach their task mindful of the needs of students preparing for ministry. This introduction is explicit in doing so, assuming as it does that the New Testament itself--in its parts and as a whole--is a pastoral response. Each chapter on the New Testament literature closes with a discussion of the implications for ministry formation. These integrative features alone would distinguish this introduction from others. But in addition, its pages brim with maps, photos, points of interest and aids to learning. Separate chapters explore the historical and cultural environment of the New Testament era, the nature of the Gospels and the quest for the historical Jesus, and the life of Paul. This introduction by David A. deSilva sets a new standard for its genre and is bound to appeal to many who believe that the New Testament should be introduced as if both scholarship and ministry mattered.</p><p>"This excellent introduction meets a special need, especially for seminarians concerned about how their academic study of the New Testament relates to ministry. David deSilva is conversant with a wide range of scholarship for the entire New Testament canon, its historical setting, and both traditional and more current approaches to the text (including rhetorical, literary and social approaches). His concern for ministry application is a valuable and unique feature, and his extensive proficiency in the ancient sources, already demonstrated in his earlier works, makes him an especially trustworthy guide in this area." (Craig S. Keener, Eastern Seminary )<br> &nbsp;<br> "David deSilva has written the New Testament introduction that I have wanted to use (and wish I had written). It is not only readable and comprehensive, but it also incorporates the latest in scholarly approaches to the New Testament. In this work we really do discover the New Testament in its historical, rhetorical and social context. Furthermore, it reads the New Testament as a pastoral and practical work. What more could one ask for? What more could one offer to students? I am indeed excited about this work." (Peter H. Davids, Tyndale Theological Seminary (The Netherlands) <br> &nbsp;<br> "This compendious handbook to the New Testament writings will prove an invaluable resource in the classroom and study. The approach is lively and topical, with a special section devoted to the application of scholarship to ministry--a feature not often found in quality books like this. . . . In all, here is a volume that carves for itself a distinctive place in what is an overcrowded market, and will be welcomed by hard-pressed students and alert pastors alike. Well done!" (Ralph P. Martin, Fuller Theological Seminary )<br> &nbsp;<br> "This introduction helpfully and without apology attends to both the intellectual and spiritual formation of the reader. . . . I am happy to commend this introduction to a whole range of readers--students, pastors and educated laypersons."

With its riveting suspense and idelibly drawn characters, <i>The Laws of our Fathers</i> shows why Turow is not only the master of the modern legal thriller but also one of America's most engaging and satisfying novelists.</p></p><p>At the close of legal-thriller novelist Scott Turow's second book, <i>The Burden of Proof</i>, Sonia Klonsky was a young prosecutor in Kindle County Courthouse with a failing marriage, an infant daughter, and a single mastectomy. Now, as the narrator of Turow's latest novel, she's a Superior Court Judge presiding over the murder trial of one Nile Eddgar, accused of arranging the slaying of his ghetto-activist mother, June. Turow attempts a sort of social history of the 60s in this ambitious mystery, but the most vivid passages come when the gangbangers of the Black Saints Disciples take center stage.The Laws of Our Fathers opens with a spectacular drive-by shooting in one of Kindle County&#39;s most notorious drug-plagued housing projects. The victim is an aging white woman who has never been seen there before; within days her son, Nile Eddgar, a probation officer, is charged in connection with the crime. Nile&#39;s trial is presided over - and narrated by - Judge Sonia &#34;Sonny&#34; Klonsky, whom Turow&#39;s fans will remember from his second novel, The Burden of Proof. It brings together a vivid cast of characters from Sonny&#39;s student years during the turbulent sixties, among them Nile&#39;s father, Loyell Eddgar, once a leading campus revolutionary, and Sonny&#39;s old boyfriend Seth Weissman, who is now a renowned journalist. All have been permanently marked by the heady iconoclasm of their youth; some carry terrible secrets that come to bear on the case at hand in unforeseeable and explosive ways.</p><h2>Rescue at Los Ba�os: The Most Daring Prison Camp Raid of World War II</h2><p><p>From the bestselling author of <em>Hero Found</em> comes the incredible true story of one of the greatest military rescues of all time, the 1945 World War II prison camp raid at Los Ba�os in the Philippines&#x2014;a tale of daring, courage, and heroism that joins the ranks of <em>Ghost Soldiers, Unbroken</em>, and <em>The Boys of Pointe du Hoc</em>.</p><p>In February 1945, as the U.S. victory in the Pacific drew nearer, the Japanese army grew desperate, and its soldiers guarding U.S. and Allied POWs more sadistic.

Ten years ago, a parasitic fungus started hijacking the brains and bodies of humans with frightening speed, decimating England's population and turning those afflicted into zombielike "hungries." Now, leaders at a fortified settlement called Beacon are desperate to halt the growth of the cataclysmic Cordyceps. They send a second mobile armored vehicle to take six soldiers, five scientists, and a teenager on a Hail Mary mission to collect samples left behind from a first group that never returned and to learn what they can to save the human race. Carey effectively brings to life many of the dozen characters. Young adults will especially appreciate the brilliant Stephen Greaves, 15, who might be on the autism spectrum. He was permitted to join the crew at the behest of Samrina Khan, the group's epidemiologist and his foster mother of sorts. Readers will be engrossed as Stephen searches for data to understand the hungries and the fungus and looks for ways to combat them, such as the e-blocker he develops to stymie the hungries' acute olfactory sense. A villainous civilian commander, an unplanned pregnancy for Khan, backbiting among the soldiers, and Stephen's work with the hungries add up to an intriguing read.

Mr. Shakarian&#39;s story is about a loving God and a loving son, whose heart wants to be in his Father&#39;s perfect will, but being human, forgets, and gets in the way. And God waits until he figures that out, steps back, and lets Him lovingly fix everything, often seeing miracles as Father God worked in his life, and in the lives of the people around him. It is a book of hope, of promise, and of love, things we all need and often forget where to go to get them. It was exactly what I needed to read, and I highly recommend it to others.</p><p></p><h2>There Was No Snow on Christmas Eve</h2><p>There was no snow on Christmas Eve. Instead, a desert zephyr blew And palm fronds sang a rustling tune To welcome the awaited birth. There was no snow, no fireplace, no need for woolen caps and gloves on that very first Christmas. Instead there was a humble stable, and weary travelers with light robes and sandals on a desert night. This luminous picture book manages to take the familiar story of the Nativity and make it fresh and immediate, reminding young children of the miracle of Christmas and the true nature of the spirit of the season, no matter what the weather.</p><p>K-Gr. 2. On a wintry night two children and an adult walk outdoors and reflect on the contrast between the snowy scene that greets them and the balmy serenity in Jerusalem when Jesus was born: "There was no snow on Christmas Eve . . . no snow on Christmas Day. Instead a desert zephyr blew and palm fronds sang a rustling tune to welcome the awaited birth." The text is spare and lyrical, with hushed tones that underscore the significance of the momentous event. It's the evocative watercolor artwork, however, that really stands out, effectively and beautifully suggesting the different worlds of then and now.

The sudden death two days earlier of City Commissioner William Joseph Brennan Sr. had eclipsed even the economic disaster enveloping the city in the early months of the Great Depression.<br>&nbsp;Thirty-eight years had passed since Bill Brennan arrived by steamship in the United States at the age of twenty, just another poor, anonymous Irish immigrant. An estimated forty thousand citizens&#x2014;equivalent to 9 percent of the city's entire population&#x2014;lined up through the night for a chance to enter the rotunda of City Hall, where his body lay in state. Standing vigil nearby was an honor guard of labor, police, and firemen Bill had led as head of the stationary firemen's union and during four terms as city commissioner. The next morning, six police horsemen and a marching band led off the parade of two thousand political, business, and union leaders accompanying the hearse. Three New Jersey National Guard airplanes dipped low overhead, dropping flowers on the mile-long funeral cortege. Throngs of somber onlookers lining Broad Street lifted their hats as the hearse passed by on its way to St. Patrick's Cathedral.<br>&nbsp;Seated in a carriage behind the hearse was William J. Brennan Jr. The younger Brennan, twenty-four, had rushed home by propeller plane from Massachusetts, where he was finishing his second year at Harvard Law School, when it had become clear that his father would not survive a sudden bout of pneumonia. But he had arrived too late to say goodbye to the man who, for decades to come, would dominate his view of the world and the course of his career.<br>&nbsp;In life, Bill, who stood nearly six feet tall, had overshadowed his still boyish-looking namesake, five feet eight, in every way. Brennan's classmates at Barringer High School teased in their yearbook that the commissioner's son got by thanks to &#x201c;Dad's reputation&#x201d; and predicted his ambition was &#x201c;to follow dad.&#x201d; Brennan had dutifully taken his father's advice and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and then Harvard Law, an Ivy League pedigree that far outshone the six grades of school Bill had completed. Brennan, soon to begin his first summer job as a lawyer, probably could not have imagined as he looked out on the massive funeral procession the extent to which he would exceed his father's professional achievements as well. Bill, however, had always expected nothing less from his oldest son.</p> <p>William J. Brennan Sr. had bloomed late, his first quarter century in Ireland and America filled with far more failures than successes. Born on December 26, 1872, in Roscommon, a poor rural county on the border between central and western Ireland, about fifty miles north of Galway, Bill was the oldest of six children of Patrick Brennan, an illiterate tenant farmer from the tiny village of Cloonshanville, and Elizabeth Kelley, of Leggatinty, an equally small nearby town. Patrick Brennan had &#x201c;married into&#x201d; the Kelley farm, moving there and eventually taking over the tenancy. Bill's grandparents likely made do with a couple of cows, sheep and pigs, and some hens, just enough for them to survive the Irish potato famine that devastated Ireland a quarter century before his birth. Bill's parents, born just after the famine, stuck it out in Ireland even as millions of others fled.<br>&nbsp;Life for Bill, as for his ancestors before him, did not extend much beyond the nearest town of Frenchpark, where farmers gathered on Friday market days to sell animals and produce and to exchange gossip. Bill, who attended primary school intermittently when he was not helping his father on the farm, decided he wanted out. At the age of sixteen he traveled to England to work as an apprentice in an uncle's pottery business at Longton, Staffordshire, near Newcastle. Bill lasted only three years in the position before concluding that neither England nor his uncle's business was for him. In 1892 he set out for the United States. Family lore has it that he landed first in Boston, although Bill ultimately chose Trenton, New Jersey, as his destination.<br>&nbsp;Trenton, capital of the nation's pottery industry, was a natural choice, given his apprenticeship in the trade. But Bill's timing could not have been worse. The Panic of 1893 soon plunged the nation into a deep depression. Trouble in the pottery industry had started even earlier. Orders dried up, and factories-including the Maddock plant where Bill worked-shut down. With little education and no skills other than in pottery, Bill next followed the path traveled by earlier waves of Irish immigrants in New Jersey: manual labor. He found a job as a laborer on a gravel train on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and quickly worked his way up to brakeman on the Lehigh Valley Railroad, although he soon lost that job too, during a strike in 1893. The victim of economic depression, free trade, and a broken strike in just his first months in America, Bill's loyalties would forever lay with the workingman.</p> <p>Leaving Trenton in the summer of 1894, Bill headed to Newark, a brawny industrial boomtown fifty miles to the north. Although the city was overshadowed by New York, its more cosmopolitan neighbor just a few miles to the east, Newark's civic boosters exaggerated only slightly when they claimed its factories built every product sold in the United States. Downtown, smokestacks dominated the skyline above factories producing everything from beer and chemicals to patent leather and hoisting engines. Webs of telegraph wire and trolley cables ran above its cobblestone streets.<br>&nbsp;Newark seemed a place of limitless possibilities to immigrants like Bill, who boosted the city's population by a third, to 246,070, during the 1890s. With its population and industry growing rapidly together, however, Newark was also a place of considerable squalor. Nowhere did opportunity and poverty entwine more than in the industrial section of town along the Passaic River known as Down Neck, or the Ironbound, a reference to the railroad lines surrounding the neighborhood. Succeeding waves of new arrivals crowded into dilapidated houses adjacent to the neighborhood's many factories.<br>&nbsp;By the time Bill arrived in Newark, the children of the Irish immigrants who had first come to the city in large numbers during the famine era had begun to ascend toward middle-class respectability. Bill had to start at the bottom, right alongside the new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. He laid tracks for the B. M. Shanley Company, then converting streetcars from horse to electric power, and shoveled coal at a licorice factory, a job that made him detest the taste or even the smell of licorice thereafter.<br>&nbsp;Then, around the dawn of the new century, Bill finally found steady employment at the forty-acre riverfront P. Ballantine &amp; Sons brewery. As a stationary fireman, Bill worked inside the brewery's power plant, where enormous coal-fed boilers belched out the steam powering all the chutes and slides, fermenting vats, and mashers from which poured barrel after barrel of lager. Watching the boiler pressure gauges and repairing them when they broke put Bill in the middle of the boiler-room hierarchy, above the coal shovelers yet below the operating engineers who supervised the power plant. Coal dust filled the air. Temperatures rose well above 100 degrees in the summer. Still, Bill surely preferred the smell of beer to licorice. He enjoyed the camaraderie among the mostly Irish stationary firemen and may have had one of his coworkers to thank for introducing him to his wife.<br>&nbsp;Family accounts differ about how Bill, handsome, with wavy dark-red hair, met his slim dark-haired wife, Bridget Agnes McDermott. One version of the story suggests that Bill boarded at the same house on Plane Street in Newark as Agnes, as she preferred to be called. In the alternative account, Bill accepted an invitation to have dinner one night at the home of a colleague, and Agnes, the host's niece, joined them at the dinner table. Either way, Bill would have known that they came from the same part of Ireland as soon as he heard Agnes's flat midlands brogue. They soon learned they shared an even closer connection. Agnes, born in 1878, had grown up in Castlerea, a town less than ten miles from his hometown. Given their narrowly circumscribed lives, they almost certainly would never have met back in Roscommon.<br>&nbsp;Although her father was an illiterate tenant farmer like Bill's, Agnes had finished more years of school than Bill, later telling her children that she scored so high on a national entrance exam, the state offered to pay her way through high school. When her mother refused, based on the notion that girls did not need so much education, Agnes resolved to save up enough money working menial jobs to immigrate to the United States, which she did around 1894, moving in with her aunt in Newark around the same time Bill arrived in the city. Their children knew little about their courtship beyond the fact that Bill and Agnes were married at St. John's Catholic Church in Newark on June 17, 1903. Eight months later Agnes gave birth to their first child, a daughter they named Katherine.<br>&nbsp;Around the time that Bill became a father, he started on a well-trod path to Irish immigrant success in early-twentieth-century America: up through union ranks and into politics. A member of Local 55 of the International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen, Bill initially sought a leadership role in the organization because he thought it was poorly run. Members paid their dues to a saloonkeeper who kept no account of their money and doled out jobs as he saw fit. Bill successfully ran for office, becoming the local's business agent. As a union officer he displayed the qualities that later made him a popular politician: honesty, transparency, and a gregarious personality.</p> <p>On April 25, 1906, attention in Newark, as in the rest of the country, was focused on San Francisco, where a devastating earthquake had struck exactly one week earlier. Agnes Brennan's thoughts were closer to home that day. Inside the Brennans' wood-frame house at 357 New Street, an unpaved road just beyond downtown, past the Morris Canal and right behind the Daly Hat Company, she went into labor with her second child. Agnes later remembered that someone flagged down the family doctor, named Haggerty, who was on his way to a wedding at nearby St. Joseph's Church and showed up at the house wearing striped pants and a cutaway morning coat. At 1 p.m. Agnes gave birth to her first son, whom they named after Bill.<br>&nbsp;As if making up for lost time, Agnes, who was twenty-six when her first child was born, spent more than half of her first sixteen years of marriage pregnant. She gave birth to eight children in all and also suffered two miscarriages. The two following William Jr. were also boys: Charlie, born in 1907, and Tom, born in 1910. Then came two more girls, Betty and Peggy, by the time young William was nine. The Brennans moved frequently, outgrowing their modest lodgings. The future Supreme Court justice spent his infancy in three different rentals around the edge of Branch Brook Park, a multiethnic section of Newark that was a step up from Down Neck. The first house he would remember was at 212 Parker Street, in a predominantly Italian neighborhood just across Bloomfield Avenue from Newark's most affluent section, Forest Hill.<br>&nbsp;Despite his union position, the elder Brennan found it difficult to support his ever-growing household, and his long hours proved exhausting. After briefly considering the more lucrative job of operating engineer, Bill ultimately decided to stay in the stationary firemen's union, where he rose to become national vice president and leader of both the Essex County and state labor federations. He began traveling around the country on union business, finding time on one such trip in 1911 to write Agnes a playful postcard from Milwaukee. &#x201c;Well kitten, I hope yourself + kidlets are well. Will be home Tues. p.m. if allowed, Your Hubby.&#x201d; That same year, Bill sat behind union president Timothy Healey as he testified on a foreign trade bill before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.<br>&nbsp;Living on the edge of affluence, William Jr. was nevertheless acutely aware of inequality and class differences. As a youngster he was put to work carrying orders for a butcher and recalled being struck by the gap separating the working-class families on his side of Bloomfield Avenue and the upper-class residents of Forest Hill, who lived in stately Victorian and colonial mansions.<br>&nbsp;At the age of five, Willie Brennan, as he was then known, went off to school at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School. Bill and Agnes sent him to parochial school either out of devotion to their faith or mere convenience, given that Sacred Heart was located on Parker Street, just a couple of blocks from their home. Brennan distinguished himself from an early age as a bookworm, much to his parents' satisfaction. They hoped all of their children would obtain the schooling they never had, which they viewed as the key to advancing beyond their station in life. As the oldest son, Brennan carried the heaviest burden of expectations, although with his high grades he generally had no trouble pleasing his father.<br>&nbsp;Bill dominated the household and brooked no dissent from his children. Brennan and his siblings knew to quiet down as soon as their father walked in the door each night. Inspiring respect, Bill resorted to physical punishment only sparingly. Brennan most vividly remembered the instances where he expected to get punished and did not, such as the time he and his younger brothers hit a baseball through a neighbor's window and the neighbor complained bitterly to Bill. &#x201c;Boy [my father] did tell us off about watching out for people's property,&#x201d; Brennan remembered. &#x201c;But that was the end of it.&#x201d; Brennan feared his father most when Bill drank. Although he could enjoy a beer or two with friends without incident, Bill was inclined to drink alone at home when something upset him at work. &#x201c;He'd get himself potted, and when that would happen, he was not a very pleasant person to have around,&#x201d; Brennan recalled. &#x201c;We'd just stay out of his way.&#x201d; Those nights of his father's drunken belligerence, seared in his memory, were a troubled foundation for Brennan. Never a problem drinker himself, alcoholism would follow him in his family life.</p> <p>The elder brennan stood in several inches of slush at the corner of Belmont and Springfield on the night of April 8, 1916, in a downpour of rain mixing with snow. The dreary weather perfectly reflected the dark mood of Bill and his fellow labor organizers as they set out to demonstrate on behalf of striking trolley-car conductors and motormen. Two weeks had passed since a small number of trolley workers had walked off the job, seeking higher pay and a nine-hour day. The Public Service Corporation still refused to recognize the strike. Newark's police department sided with the powerful company, which also controlled the city's gas and electric utilities. Police officers broke up demonstrations and deployed en masse to prevent picketing outside the car barns where trolleys were housed. Union men retaliated by sabotaging at least one trolley car and throwing s...</p></p><h2>Stop the Thyroid Madness: A Patient Revolution Against Decades of Inferior Treatment</h2><p>With even more pages, a new chapter on foods and supplements, and additions throughout the entire book, this informative Second Edition of the ever-popular classic, &#34;Stop the Thyroid Madness: A Patient Revolution Against Decades of Inferior Treatment&#34;, continues to break ground as the ONLY thyroid patient-to-patient book on the market. It addresses a 60+ year, international thyroid treatment scandal involving the use of T4-only medications like Synthroid and other T4-only meds, as well as the TSH lab test--both which have left hundreds of millions worldwide either undiagnosed or undertreated. It explains in detail: 1) what medications work far better and why; 2) which labwork is better than others, and how to read the results (i.e., it has nothing to do with just being &#34;in range&#34;); 3) how a huge body of thyroid patients fall into adrenal fatigue/HPA dysfunction as a result of poor treatment by doctors, plus what patients have learned in treating it; 4) a long list of causes of hypothyr</p><p></p><h2>Scarlet</h2><p>Cinder is back and trying to break out of prison--even though she&#39;ll be the Commonwealth&#39;s most wanted fugitive if she does--in this second installment from Marissa Meyer.

In this classic tale, a woman is reunited with the man she has loved for years&#x2014;and must reveal the secret that will jeopardize her chance for happiness at last. <br><br>He arrived out of the blue&#x2014;a flesh-and-blood phantom from the past in a sports car as sleek and sexy as Law Kincaid himself. The world-famous astronaut was as devastatingly attractive as the first time Marnie Hibbs had laid eyes on him, seventeen years before. But she well knew the perils of falling for a ladies&#x2019; man like Law. And this time she had someone besides herself to protect. Law is determined to discover who is sending him anonymous letters claiming he&#x2019;d fathered a son he knows nothing about. Showing up at the Hibbs&#x2019;s return address from the letters seemed like a step in the right direction. Marnie swears she isn&#x2019;t the guilty party, but when Law meets her son, it&#x2019;s like a one-two punch to his solar plexus. The boy is nearly the spitting image of Law. Law can&#x2019;t remember sleeping with Marnie&#x2014;then again, he can&#x2019;t remember much about his crazy past. But there&#x2019;s more to it than that: Marnie claims the boy isn&#x2019;t biologically hers. <br><br>As the tension between them becomes unbearable and the attraction undeniable, Marnie is forced to reveal a long-held secret...one that might cause her to lose both the boy she loves more than anyone&#x2014;and the man she desires more than anything.</p><p>Sandra Brown is the author of more than fifty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

She and her family divide their time between South Carolina and Texas.1<br><br>The Porsche crept along the street like a sleek black panther. Hugging the curb, its engine purred so deep and low it sounded like a predator's growl.<br><br>Marnie Hibbs was kneeling in the fertile soil of her flower bed, digging among the impatiens under the ligustrum bushes and cursing the little bugs that made three meals a day of them, when the sound of the car's motor attracted her attention. She glanced at it over her shoulder, then panicked as it came to a stop in front of her house.<br><br>"Lord, is it that late?" she muttered. Dropping her trowel, she stood up and brushed the clinging damp earth off her bare knees.<br><br>She reached up to push her dark bangs off her forehead before she realized that she still had on her heavy gardening gloves. Quickly she peeled them off and dropped them beside the trowel, all the while watching the driver get out of the sports car and start up her front walk.<br><br>Glancing at her wristwatch, she saw that she hadn't lost track of time. He was just very early for their appointment, and as a result, she wasn't going to make a very good first impression. Being hot, sweaty, and dirty was no way to meet a client. And she needed this commission badly.<br><br>Forcing a smile, she moved down the sidewalk to greet him, nervously trying to remember if she had left the house and studio reasonably neat when she decided to do an hour's worth of yard work. She had planned to tidy up before he arrived.<br><br>She might look like the devil, but she didn't want to appear intimidated. Self-confident friendliness was the only way to combat the disadvantage of having been caught looking her worst.<br><br>He was still several yards away from her when she greeted him. "Hello," she said with a bright smile. "Obviously we got our signals switched. I thought you weren't coming until later."<br><br>"I decided this diabolical game of yours had gone on long enough."<br><br>Marnie's sneakers skidded on the old concrete walk as she came to an abrupt halt. She tilted her head in stunned surprise. "I'm sorry, I--"<br><br>"Who the hell are you, lady?"<br><br>"Miss Hibbs. Who do you think?"<br><br>"Never heard of you. Just what the devil are you up to?"<br><br>"Up to?" She glanced around helplessly, as though the giant sycamores in her front yard might provide an answer to this bizarre interrogation.<br><br>"Why've you been sending me those letters?"<br><br>"Letters?"<br><br>He was clearly furious, and her lack of comprehension only seemed to make him angrier. He bore down on her like a hawk on a field mouse, until she had to bow her back to look up at him. The summer sun was behind him, casting him in silhouette.<br><br>He was blond, tall, trim, and dressed in casual slacks and a sport shirt--all stylish, impeccably so. He was wearing opaque aviator glasses, so she couldn't see his eyes, but if they were as belligerent as his expression and stance, she was better off not seeing them.<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>"The letters, lady, the letters." He strained the words through a set of strong white teeth.<br><br>"What letters?"<br><br>"Don't play dumb."<br><br>"Are you sure you've got the right house?"<br><br>He took another step forward. "I've got the right house," he said in a voice that was little more than a snarl.<br><br>"Obviously you don't." She didn't like being put on the defensive, especially by someone she'd never met over something of which she was totally ignorant. "You're either crazy or drunk, but in any case, you're wrong. I'm not the person you're looking for and I demand that you leave my property. Now."<br><br>"You were expecting me. I could tell by the way you spoke to me."<br><br>"I thought you were the man from the advertising agency."<br><br>"Well, I'm not."<br><br>"Thank God." She would hate having to do business with someone this irrational and ill-tempered.<br><br>"You know damn well who I am," he said, peeling off the sunglasses.<br><br>Marnie sucked in a quick, sharp breath and fell back a step because she did indeed know who he was. She raised a hand to her chest in an attempt at keeping her jumping heart in place. "Law," she gasped.<br><br>"That's right. Law Kincaid. Just like you wrote it on the envelopes."<br><br>She was shocked to see him after all these years, standing only inches in front of her. This time he wasn't merely a familiar image in the newspaper or on her television screen. He was flesh and blood. The years had been kind to that flesh, improving his looks, not eroding them.<br><br>She wanted to stand and stare, but he was staring at her with unmitigated contempt and no recognition at all. "Let's go inside, Mr. Kincaid," she suggested softly.<br><br>Several of her neighbors, who had been taking advantage of the sunny weekend weather to do yard chores, had stopped moving, edging, and watering to gawk at the car and Miss Hibbs's visitor.<br>It wasn't out of the ordinary for a man to come to her house. Many of her clients were men and most of them consulted with her there. Generally they were stodgy executives in dark business suits. Few had deep tans, looked like movie stars, and drove such ostentatious cars.<br><br>This area of Houston wasn't glitzy like some of the newer neighborhoods. Most of the residents were middle-aged and drove sensible sedans. A Porsche on the block was a curious thing indeed. And to her neighbors' recollections, Marnie Hibbs had never engaged in a shouting match with anyone.<br><br>She turned on the squeaky rubber soles of her sneakers and led Law Kincaid up the sidewalk and through the front door of her house. Air-conditioning was a welcome respite from the humidity outside, but since she was damp with perspiration, the colder air chilled her. Or maybe it was her distinct awareness of the man behind her that was giving her goose bumps.<br><br>"This way."<br><br>She led him down a spacious hallway, the kind that could be found only in houses built before World War II, and toward the glassed-in back porch, which served as her studio. There she felt more at home, more at ease, and better able to deal with the astonishing reality that Law Kincaid had unexpectedly walked into her life again.<br><br>When she turned to face him, his arctic-blue eyes were darting around the studio. They connected with hers like magnets.<br><br>"Well?" he said tersely, placing his hands on his hips. He was obviously awaiting a full explanation for something Marnie was in the dark about herself.<br><br>"I don't know anything about any letters, Mr. Kincaid."<br><br>"They were mailed from this address."<br><br>"Then there's been a mistake at the post office."<br><br>"Unlikely. Not five times over the course of several weeks. Look, Mrs. uh . . . what was it again?"<br><br>"Hibbs. Miss Hibbs."<br><br>He gave her a swift, inquisitive once-over. "Miss Hibbs, I've been a bachelor for thirty-nine years. <br><br>"It's been a while since puberty. I don't remember every woman I've gone to bed with."<br><br>Her heart did another little dance number, and she took a quick, insufficient breath. "I've never been to bed with you."<br><br>He threw one hip slightly off-center and cocked his head arrogantly. "Then how is it that you claim to have mothered a son by me? A son I'd never even heard of until I got your first letter several weeks ago."<br><br>Marnie stared at him with speechless dismay. She could feel the color draining from her face. It felt like the world had been yanked from beneath her feet.<br><br>"I've never had a child. And I repeat, I never sent you a letter." She gestured at a chair. "Why don't you sit down?" She didn't offer him a seat out of courtesy or any concern for his comfort. She was afraid that if she didn't sit, and soon, her knees would buckle beneath her.<br><br>He thought about it for a moment, gnawing irritably on the corner of his lower lip before he moved to a rattan chair. He sat down on the very edge of the cushion, as though wanting to be ready to spring off it if the need arose.<br><br>Self-conscious of her muddy sneakers, ragged cutoffs, and ancient T-shirt, Marnie sat in the matching chair facing his. She sat straight, keeping her dirty knees together and clasping her hands nervously on the tops of her thighs.<br><br>She felt unclothed and vulnerable as his incisive eyes moved over her, taking in her face, her uncombed hair, her yard work attire, and her grubby knees.<br><br>"You recognized me." He shot the sentence at her like a missile.<br><br>"Anybody who watches TV or reads a newspaper would recognize you. You're the most popular astronaut since John Glenn."<br><br>"And therefore I'm a visible target for every nutcase who comes down the pike."<br><br>"I am not a nutcase!"<br><br>"Then why the hell have you been sending me those letters? That's not even an original idea, you know. I get several dozen a day."<br><br>"Congratulations."<br><br>"They're not all fan letters. Some are hate mail from the religious crazies who believe we're going where God never intended man to go. Some credit God with the Challenger accident--His punishment for our tampering with heaven or nonsense to that effect. I've had proposals of marriage and of other assorted liaisons of a prurient and/or perverted nature," he said dryly.<br><br>"How nice for you."<br><br>Ignoring her snide remark, he continued. "But your letters had a stroke of originality. You were the first one to claim that I was the father of your child."<br><br>"Don't you listen? I told you I've never had a child. How could you possibly be the father?"<br><br>"My point exactly, Miss Hibbs!" he shouted.<br><br>Marnie stood. So did he. He tracked her when she moved to her drafting table and needle...</p><h2>The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2019 New-York Historical Society Barbara and David Zalaznick Book Prize in American History</b><br> <b>Winner of the 2018 American Academy of Diplomacy Douglas Dillon Award</b><br> <b>Shortlisted for the 2018 Duff Cooper Prize in Literary Nonfiction</b><br> <b>Honorable Mention (runner-up) for the 2019 ASEEES Marshall D.

Marshall set out to reconstruct western Europe as a bulwark against communist authoritarianism. Their massive, costly, and ambitious undertaking would confront Europeans and Americans alike with a vision at odds with their history and self-conceptions. In the process, they would drive the creation of NATO, the European Union, and a Western identity that continues to shape world events.<br> <br> Focusing on the critical years 1947 to 1949, Benn Steil&#x2019;s thrilling account brings to life the seminal episodes marking the collapse of postwar US-Soviet relations&#x2014;the Prague coup, the Berlin blockade, and the division of Germany. In each case, we see and understand like never before Stalin&#x2019;s determination to crush the Marshall Plan and undermine American power in Europe.<br> <br> Given current echoes of the Cold War, as Putin&#x2019;s Russia rattles the world order, the tenuous balance of power and uncertain order of the late 1940s is as relevant as ever. <i>The Marshall Plan</i> provides critical context into understanding today&#x2019;s international landscape. Bringing to bear fascinating new material from American, Russian, German, and other European archives, Steil&#x2019;s account will forever change how we see the Marshall Plan and the birth of the Cold War.

They think precautions are being taken, but never check to see if they are. A key intelligence officer wants more warnings sent, but he is on the losing end of a bureaucratic battle and can&#x2019;t get the message out. American sleuths have pierced Japan&#x2019;s most vital diplomatic code, and Washington believes it has a window on the enemy&#x2019;s soul&#x2014;but it does not.<br> <br>In a small office at Pearl Harbor, overlooking the battleships at the heart of America&#x2019;s seafaring power, the Commander of the Pacific Fleet tries to figure out how much danger he really faces. His intelligence unit has lost track of Japan&#x2019;s biggest aircraft carriers, but assumes they are resting in a port far away. The admiral thinks Pearl is too shallow for torpedoes, so he never puts up a barrier. As he frets, a Japanese spy is counting the warships in the harbor and reporting to Tokyo.<br> <br>There were false assumptions, and racist ones: The Japanese aren&#x2019;t very good aviators and they don&#x2019;t have the nerve or the skill to attempt a strike so far from their home. There were misunderstandings, conflicting desires, painful choices. And there was a naval officer who, on his very first mission as captain of his very first ship, did exactly the right thing. His warning could have averted disaster, but his superiors reacted too leisurely. Japanese planes arrived moments later.<br> <br>Twomey&#x2019;s telescoping of the twelve days leading to the attack unravels the crucial characters and moments, and produces an edge-of-your seat drama with fascinating details about America at this moment in its history. By the end, the reader understands how assumption is the root of disaster, and how sometimes a gamble pays off.</p><p>Steve Twomey began his career in journalism as a copyboy at the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> when he was in high school.

Every battleship in the fleet bore the name of one, as if its species embodied the very Union itself. The officers snapped salutes to the Stars and Stripes at the Pennsylvania&#x2019;s stern, 608 feet from her bow. By now, each of the sixteen American battleships was older than most members of her crew and not exactly gazelle-like, lugging armor plating, crowded magazines, big guns, small guns, antiaircraft guns. But they remained tough and still occupied the rung of highest naval prestige, which was to sink the enemy&#x2019;s big ships so America could rule the waves of commerce and impose its will, should that seem desirable.<br> <br>To witness a broadside from their main batteries was to see an angry Zeus hurl tons of explosives a dozen miles or more. A radioman aboard the California would recall the 35,000-ton ship&#x2019;s &#x201c;convulsive lurch&#x201d; as blasts from the fourteen-inch guns slammed her in the opposite direction, &#x201c;sideways in the water.&#x201d; There would be &#x201c;mighty thunderclaps of sound,&#x201d; and flames, and smoke that &#x201c;smelled as if it had just come from the nether regions.&#x201d; Hanson W. Baldwin, the military-affairs reporter for the New York Times, found it &#x201c;frightening&#x201d; to be aboard a battleship and &#x201c;have a sixteen-inch gun go off at full load and high elevation, because you get an awful whump in the stomach and ears, and everywhere else!&#x201d; In a few months, the program of the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia would feature a photo of the Arizona crashing bow-on through formidable seas, seemingly unsinkable and certainly intimidating. Battleships had panache, and people loved the sight of them.<br> <br>Arriving from throughout Pearl Harbor, the guests in white uniform eddied aft and formed into a square, its center left empty, beyond the last of the Pennsylvania&#x2019;s four main turrets, whose three barrels had been elevated slightly to make more room for the capped heads beneath. Above, on the turret&#x2019;s roof, stood announcers of the Columbia Broadcasting System. One microphone for the outgoing admiral had been placed in the middle of the human square, another for the admiral ascending. Two thousand ninety-one nautical miles to the northeast, on the mainland, it was Saturday afternoon.<br> <br>&#x201c;The ceremony is about to get under way,&#x201d; CBS&#x2019;s Victor Eckland said, &#x201c;and as we take a sweeping glance from one side of this giant battleship to the other, we see an array of manhood in naval officialdom of which every American can be justly proud.&#x201d; The navy did seem to inflate the national pride. More than the army and the marines&#x2014;there was no separate air force yet&#x2014;it wore a halo of glamour, sailing the country&#x2019;s two flanking oceans, slicing protective wakes. As was often and simply put by press and politicians alike, America had invincible warships. Visiting Hawaii the previous September, the secretary of the navy, Frank Knox, had let himself positively roar: &#x201c;The greatest, most powerful and the most effective fleet on the high seas anywhere in the world.&#x201d; He would utter similar claims during the coming months, including one that would be published on the front page of the New York Times edition that would be delivered to doorsteps on the first Sunday morning of December, the seventh. Some officers on Oahu wished Knox would be less enthusiastic. They knew the navy was not ready to fight. The public might get the wrong idea.<br> <br>That day&#x2019;s change of command would be less celebratory than was traditional during peacetime, not because America was at war, but because it was rapidly approaching one and was rearming as fast as it could, faster than at any time in its history, racing against an emptying hourglass. Since 1939, the Nazis had overrun much of Europe and had besieged Great Britain, and since 1937, the Japanese had consumed much of China and had swarmed into Indochina. Full-dress attire would not be in order aboard the Pennsylvania. Guns would not boom in salute. Air fleets would not dapple the sky in review. Nor would the harbor pause in respect. &#x201c;We hear the hum of work&#x2014;riveters, steel workers, ship fitters, boilermakers, and all of the other men and machines that are being kept busy here at Pearl Harbor,&#x201d; Eckland went on.<br> <br>The geologic miracle that was the harbor was a substantial reason the United States had decided it ought to own Hawaii, having egged on political unrest&#x2014;minority whites versus the indigenous&#x2014;that opened the door to annexation. The islands had been an independent kingdom, blessed&#x2014;or maybe cursed&#x2014;with a huge lagoon stamped into the southern coastline of Oahu. Its name, Pearl, may have arisen from its oyster beds. Its shape evoked an alluvial fan. Or maybe a clover: a narrow stem leading from the sea to three watery petals, west, middle, east. Echoing a Scotland that was nowhere within nine thousand sea miles, the petals had come to be called &#x201c;lochs,&#x201d; Gaelic for &#x201c;lakes.&#x201d;<br> <br>During annexation hearings in 1898, General John McAllister Schofield, who had explored Hawaii extensively, told the US House of Representatives that Oahu&#x2019;s clover lagoon would be ideal for a modern navy&#x2014;meaning a late-nineteenth-century one, which had no worries about being trapped in a confined harbor and riddled by airplanes, for there were none of those yet. Pearl&#x2019;s narrow mouth and channel could easily be guarded against an incursion by hostile warships. Any shells fired from offshore could not reach warships tethered inside. The lochs and surrounding land could support dozens of warships, as well as docks, maintenance shops, and coal stocks for ship boilers. If we don&#x2019;t take Pearl Harbor and Hawaii, General Schofield testified, the Spanish might. The Japanese might. Imperial lust had triumphed. On August 12, 1898, in a ceremony in Honolulu, the flag of the United States had risen above its newest acquisition, probably against the wishes of most Hawaiians.<br> <br>At ten a.m., the two highest-ranking participants in the Pennsylvania&#x2019;s formalities emerged from its innards. &#x201c;With the dignity of their rank and surrounded by their fellow officers and men who share with them the tradition of 165 years of U.S. naval history,&#x201d; the announcer said, &#x201c;Admiral James O. Richardson and Admiral Husband E. Kimmel make their appearance on deck. Admiral Richardson steps from the port hatch to the quarterdeck, and Admiral Kimmel steps from the starboard hatch to the quarterdeck. They approach Columbia&#x2019;s microphones together.&#x201d;<br> <br>For Richardson, who was sixty-two, the moment overflowed with humiliation. He had risen out of the backwater of Paris, Texas, to the navy&#x2019;s best job, commander of the Pacific Fleet, only to have it yanked away after a dozen months, not the minimum eighteen, let alone the twenty-four that most fleet commanders actually served. &#x201c;My God, they can&#x2019;t do that to me,&#x201d; he had said upon reading the message an aide delivered to him on an Oahu golf course on January 5. The public removal of a man considered smart, witty, and competent dumbfounded many serving under him who, using the initials of his first and middle names&#x2014;J and O&#x2014;called him Uncle Joe. The victim professed he hadn&#x2019;t foreseen his demise, either, but that was more fib than fact. Richardson was a font of negativity and a know-it-all. &#x201c;Unfortunately,&#x201d; he said later, &#x201c;I am definite in most of my opinions.&#x201d;<br> <br>Attending the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1934, for example, he had simply declined to write his thesis on the assigned topic, the relationship in naval warfare among strategy, tactics, and command. Too broad for one paper, he had told his instructors. With sarcastic understatement, he had written that the assignment left him &#x201c;confused by the multiplicity of tasks and by the realization that an industrious and gifted writer&#x201d;&#x2014;presumably him&#x2014;&#x201c;might, somewhat inadequately, cover the subject [only] in a lifetime.&#x201d; So he would not try. He framed his own topic and proceeded to discuss that.<br> <br>Rising, nonetheless, to commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet in early January 1940, he began to question the strategy and acumen of his ultimate superior, Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom he had known a long time and had worked closely with as head of the Navy Department&#x2019;s personnel division. He did not care for him. The president had two hobbies, Richardson would say later, &#x201c;stamp collecting and playing with the Navy,&#x201d; and he was accurate on both counts. Roosevelt, the assistant secretary of the navy during the Great War, did love ships. The proof dotted his second-floor study at the White House: glass cases sheltering ship models, and walls dotted with oil paintings of ships under sail, in one spot stacked four high. His fondness for things nautical was so well-known that citizens wrote with offers to sell or give him ship logs, models, and prints. His secretary, Grace Tully, once had to decline a miniature of the French liner Normandie, telling the owner, &#x201c;He already has a model of this steamship.&#x201d;<br> <br>The president did not merely collect knickknacks of the sea. He took the title of commander in chief to mean naval expert. Ten days from then, on February 10, for example, he would write the Navy Department that he would &#x201c;hate&#x201d; to see it go through with plans to sell a couple of old ships. &#x201c;Let me see the bids for their sale when they come in,&#x201d; he would write, apparently hoping he would find them insufficiently high to warrant a sale. About the same time, he would ask if catapults to launch planes could be installed on two warships. In yet another query, he would wonder about &#x201c;the use of 70- and 77-foot sea sleds with pompom and Y gun.&#x201d; And on April 23, he would write to Navy Secretary Knox, &#x201c;Please speak to me about the possibility of a patrol on Hudson Bay this summer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Richardson regarded Roosevelt as a meddling amateur, a dangerous one. As relations with Japan deteriorated, the admiral feared that the president did not appreciate just how undermanned and untrained his navy was, even as Roosevelt counted on it to scare the Japanese into staying in line. &#x201c;If you do not tell the boss what you really know and feel about the possible cost and duration in an Orange war, NOBODY WILL,&#x201d; he had written the department on January 26, 1940, using the euphemism for Japan employed in American war games. It was deeply misguided to think the Pacific Fleet had the manpower, the guns, the supply system, and the training to back up the tough statements and strategies of the civilian leadership, Uncle Joe felt, and Japan knew it.<br> <br>Traditionally, the fleet had lived on the West Coast, in the ports of San Diego and Long Beach, visiting Pearl only on maneuvers. The harbor&#x2019;s lochs had been more of a forward outpost with a small permanent flotilla, and it lacked much of the infrastructure of a major base. But on April 29, 1940, a few months after Richardson had taken command, Roosevelt ordered the entire fleet to take up station in the embracing arms of Pearl until he said differently. With France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands diverted by the brutal struggle against Germany, he had reasoned that their Far East colonies would tempt the Japanese, which indeed they did. A fleet sitting so much nearer would deter them, the president thought. But to Richardson, FDR&#x2019;s move smacked of bluff, given how unready the fleet was, all for the sake of a part of the world, the Far East, that he thought should not mean that much to the United States anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel that any move west [to Pearl] means hostilities,&#x201d; Richardson had written to Washington on May 13, 1940. &#x201c;I feel that at this time it would be a grave mistake to become involved in the [Far East] where our interests, although important, are not vital.&#x201d; In a September 12 memo, he told Secretary Knox that the president&#x2019;s policies were &#x201c;aggressive.&#x201d; The memo had wondered whether anybody in the capital had given careful thought to anything. Not only was the navy not ready for war with Japan, neither was the public, Richardson believed, because Roosevelt had not been straight about the threat, not wishing to upset voters so near the 1940 election.<br> <br>Nor did Richardson confine himself to questioning grand strategy and national policy. In the same memo, the admiral gave Knox all the practical reasons Roosevelt had erred in moving the fleet to Pearl. Morale among crews had dropped because their families remained in California; every single necessity&#x2014;oil, munitions, replacement personnel, oceangoing targets for gunnery practice&#x2014;had to be brought from the mainland. Oahu&#x2019;s recreation and training facilities could not absorb thousands upon thousands of newly arrived officers and enlisted men. The sheer volume of ships clogged even spacious Pearl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Americans are perfectly willing to go anywhere, stay anywhere, do anything when there is a job to be done and they can see the reason for their being there,&#x201d; Richardson said later, &#x201c;but to keep the fleet&#x2014;during what the men considered normal peacetimes&#x2014;away from the coast and away from their families, away from recreation, rendered it difficult to maintain a high state of morale that is essential to successful training.&#x201d;<br> <br>These were excellent, almost undeniable points. Putting the fleet at Pearl was disruptive. But by complaining so loudly, Richardson came across as uncooperative, pessimistic, defeatist. And those were unwelcome qualities in a military commander in a dangerous global environment. Summoned to the capital, the admiral sat down with the president on October 8, 1940, and promptly removed any doubt about how long he ought to serve. &#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I feel that I must tell you that the senior officers of the Navy do not have the trust and confidence in the civilian leadership of this country that is essential for the successful prosecution of a war in the Pacific.&#x201d; Richardson was not unburdening himself spontaneously. He had planned exactly what he would say. &#x201c;I thought that the President could be shocked into either changing his policies, or providing adequate implementation of them,&#x201d; he said, by beefing up the fleet, especially by bringing ship companies up to full complement. In Richardson&#x2019;s view, a misguided civilian needed a healthy face slap of reality from a career officer. &#x201c;I can state with complete accuracy that when the President heard my statement, he looked and acted completely crushed.&#x201d; Well, of course he did. The navy, the object of Roosevelt&#x2019;s lifelong affection, had just spurned his love.<br> <br>After he was fired a few months later, Richardson told Knox, &#x201c;I have never known a commander in chief to be detached in such a summary manner as I have been, and I feel that I owe it to myself to inquire as to the reason for my preemptory detachment.&#x201d; Knox must have been amused at the presumption of innocence. &#x201c;Why Richardson,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;when you were in Washington last October, you hurt the President&#x2019;s feelings by what you said to him.&#x201d; At least the admiral would savor a morsel of grim satisfaction. Ten months after the chang...</p><h2>Case of the Late Pig</h2><p>Called to a quiet English country town to investigate a murder, Albert Campion finds that his old school chum Pig Peters is dead--again--and embarks on a quest to learn the truth about Pig&#39;s strange double life</p><p><p>Margery Allingham was born in Ealing, London in 1904 to a family immersed in literature. Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p>Margery Allingham would surely have adored the Albert Campion portrayed here. This is the seventeenth mystery featuring the unassuming detective that is narrated by Francis Matthews. In the village of Kepesake, an accident or murder has claimed the life of Pig Peters, whose funeral Campion attended several months before. This case, like the others, is perfect for Matthews&#39;s affinity for characterizations. He excels with eccentric country gentlemen, society ladies, ingenues or a hapless vicar and revels in the outrageous characters Allingham conjured up. Perhaps Matthews&#39;s crowning achievement is Lug, Campion&#39;s incomparable manservant. Irreverent and unpredictable, Lug and Campion make exceptional listening through the voice of Francis Matthews. R.F.W.

The proud owner of a spanking-new medical degree and little else in the way of worldly possessions, Barry jumps at the chance to secure a position as an assistant in a small rural practice.</p><p>At least until he meets Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly.</p><p>The older physician, whose motto is to never let the patients get the upper hand, has his own way of doing things. At first, Barry can't decide if the pugnacious O'Reilly is the biggest charlatan he has ever met, or the best teacher he could ever hope for. Through O'Reilly Barry soon gets to know all of the village's colorful and endearing residents, including:</p><p>A malingering Major and his equally hypochondriacal wife;</p><p>An unwed servant girl, who refuses to divulge the father of her upcoming baby;</p><p>A slightly daft old couple unable to marry for lack of a roof;</p><p>And a host of other eccentric characters who make every day an education for the inexperienced young doctor.</p><p>Ballybucklebo is long way from Belfast, and Barry is quick to discover that he still has a lot to learn about the quirks and traditions of country life. But with pluck and compassion and only the slightest touch of blarney, he will find out more about life--and love--than he ever imagined back in medical school.</p><p><i>An Irish Country Doctor</i> is a charming and engrossing tale that will captivate readers from the very first page--and leave them yearning to visit the Irish countryside of days gone by.</p></p><p><p>Patrick Taylor, M.D., is the author of the Irish Country books, including <i>An Irish Country Village</i>, <i>An Irish Country Christmas</i>, <i>An Irish Country Girl</i>, and <i>An Irish Country Courtship</i>.

He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p><p>Author&#x2019;s NoteDoctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly and the denizens of Ballybucklebo first appeared in 1995 in my monthly column in Stitches: The Journal of Medical Humour. It was suggested to me that these characters might form the foundation for a novel.I had just finished Pray for Us Sinners, and hesitating to delve once more into the misery of the Ulster Troubles, I found the idea of something lighter to be appealing. An Irish Country Doctor began to take shape.Like Only Wounded and Pray for Us Sinners, the book is set in the northeast corner of Ireland, but unlike its predecessors, which I strove to make historically accurate, this story has taken some liberties with geography and time.The setting is a fictional village, the name of which came from my high-school French teacher who, enraged by my inability to conjugate irregular verbs, yelled, &#x201c;Taylor, you&#x2019;re stupid enough to come from Ballybucklebo.&#x201d; Those of an etymological bent may wish to know what the name means. Bally (Irish, baile) is a townland&#x2014;a mediaeval geographic term encompassing a small village and the surrounding farms, Buachaill means &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and b� is a cow. In Bailebuchaillb�, or Ballybucklebo&#x2014;the townland of the boy&#x2019;s cow&#x2014;time and place are as skewed as they are in Brigadoon.Little Irish is spoken in the North, but I have been at pains to use the Ulster dialect. It is rich and colourful, but often incomprehensible to one not from that part of the world. For those who may have some difficulty, I have taken the liberty of appending a glossary (page 345).My attention to the spoken idiom is as accurate as I can make it; however, the purist will note that in 1964, the Twelfth of July fell on a Sunday, not a Thursday, and Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s first book of poetry was not published until 1966. No salmon river called the Bucklebo flows through north County Down. The nearest is the Shimna River in the Mourne Mountains. But everything else is as accurate as extensive reading and memory permit.The rural Ulster that I have portrayed has vanished. The farms and villages still look much as they did, but the simplicity of rural life has been banished by the Troubles and the all-pervasive influence of television. The automatic respect for their learning shown to those at the top of the village hierarchy&#x2014;doctor, teacher, minister, and priest&#x2014;is a thing of the past, but men like O&#x2019;Reilly were common when I was a very junior doctor. And on that subject, may I please lay to rest a question I am frequently asked by readers of my column in Stitches? Barry Laverty and Patrick Taylor are not one and the same. Doctor F. F. O&#x2019;Reilly is a figment of my troubled mind, despite the efforts of some of my expatriate Ulster friends to see in him a respected&#x2014;if unorthodox&#x2014;medical practitioner of the time. Lady Macbeth does owe her being to our demoniacally possessed cat, Minnie, and Arthur Guinness owes his to a black Labrador, now long gone but who had an insatiable thirst for Foster&#x2019;s lager. All the other characters are composites, drawn from my imagination and from my experiences as a rural GP.Patrick Taylor1You Can&#x2019;t Get There from HereBarry Laverty&#x2014;Doctor Barry Laverty&#x2014;his houseman&#x2019;s year just finished, ink barely dry on his degree, pulled his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle to the side of the road and peered at a map lying on the passenger seat. Six Road Ends was clearly marked. He stared through the car&#x2019;s insect-splattered windscreen. Judging by the maze of narrow country roads that ran one into the other just up ahead, somewhere at the end of one of those blackthorn-hedged byways lay the village of Ballybucklebo. But which road should he take? And, he reminded himself, there was more to that question than simple geography.Most of his graduating classmates from the medical school of the Queen&#x2019;s University of Belfast had clear plans for their careers. But he hadn&#x2019;t a clue. General practice? Specialize? And if so, which speciality? Barry shrugged. He was twenty-four, single, no responsibilities. He knew he had all the time in the world to think about his medical future, but his immediate prospects might not be bright if he were late for his five o&#x2019;clock appointment, and though finding a direction for his life might be important, his most pressing need was to earn enough to pay off the loan on the car.He scowled at the map and retraced the road he had travelled from Belfast, but the Six Road Ends lay near the margin of the paper. No Ballybucklebo in sight. What to do?He looked up, and as he did he glimpsed himself in the rearview mirror. Blue eyes looked back at him from a clean-shaven oval face. His tie was askew. No matter how carefully he tied the thing, the knot always managed to wander off under one collar tip. He understood the importance of first impressions and did not want to look scruffy. He tugged the tie back into place, then tried to smooth down the cowlick on the crown of his fair hair, but up it popped. He shrugged. It would just have to stay that way. He wasn&#x2019;t going to a beauty contest&#x2014;it was his medical credentials that would be scrutinized. At least his hair was cut short, not like the style affected by that new musical group, the Beatles.One last glance at the map confirmed that it would be of no help in finding his destination. Perhaps, he thought, there would be a signpost at the junction. He got out of the vehicle, and the springs creaked. Brunhilde, as he called his car, was protesting about the weight of his worldly goods: two suitcases, one with his meagre wardrobe, the other crammed with medical texts; a doctor&#x2019;s medical bag tucked under the bonnet; and a fly rod, creel, and hip waders lying in the backseat. Not much to show for someone possessing a medical degree, he thought, but with any luck his finances would soon take a turn for the better&#x2014;if he could just find Ballybucklebo.He leant against the car door, conscious that his five-foot-eight, slightly built frame barely gave him enough height to peer over Brunhilde&#x2019;s domed roof, and even standing on tiptoe he could see no evidence of a signpost. Perhaps it was hidden behind the hedges.He walked to the junction and looked around to find a grave deficiency of signposts. Maybe Ballybucklebo&#x2019;s like Brigadoon, he thought, and only appears every hundred years. I&#x2019;d better start humming &#x201c;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&#x201d; and hope to God one of the little people shows up to give me directions.He walked back to the car in the warmth of the Ulster afternoon, breathing in the gorse&#x2019;s perfume from the little fields at either side of the road. He heard the liquid notes of a blackbird hiding in the fuchsia that grew wild in the hedgerow, the flowers drooping purple and scarlet in the summer air. Somewhere a cow lowed in basso counterpoint to the blackbird&#x2019;s treble.Barry savoured the moment. He might be unclear about what his future held, but one thing was certain. Nothing could ever persuade him that there was anywhere, anywhere at all, he would choose to live other than here in Northern Ireland.No map, no signpost, and no little people, he thought as he approached the car. I&#x2019;ll just have to pick a road and... He was pleasantly surprised to see a figure mounted on a bicycle crest the low hill and pedal sedately along the road.&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Barry stepped into the path of the oncoming cyclist. &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; The cyclist wobbled, braked, and stood, one foot on the ground and the other on a pedal. For a moment Barry wondered if his hopes of meeting a leprechaun had been fulfilled. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; he said.He was addressing a gangly youth, innocent face half hidden under a Paddy hat, but not hidden well enough to disguise a set of buckteeth that Barry decided would be the envy of every hare in the Six Counties. He carried a pitchfork over one shoulder and wore a black worsted waistcoat over a collarless shirt. His tweed trousers were tied at the knees with leather thongs that the locals called &#x201c;nicky tams.&#x201d;&#x201c;Grand day,&#x201d; he remarked.&#x201c;It is.&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye. Grand. Hay&#x2019;s coming along fine, so it is.&#x201d; The youth picked his nose.&#x201c;I wonder if you could help me?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye?&#x201d; The cyclist lifted his hat and scratched his ginger hair. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Ballybucklebo.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; His brow knitted, and the head scratching increased.&#x201c;Can you tell me how to get there?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; He pursed his lips. &#x201c;Boys-a-boys, thon&#x2019;s a grand wee place, so it is.&#x201d;Barry tried not to let his growing exasperation show. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is, but I have to get there by five.&#x201d;&#x201c;Five? Today, like?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Barry bit back the words &#x201c;No. In the year 2000.&#x201d; He waited.The youth fumbled in the fob pocket of his waistcoat, produced a pocketwatch, and consulted it, frowning and muttering to himself. He looked at Barry. &#x201c;Five? You&#x2019;ve no much time left.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know that. If you could just&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d;&#x201c;Please?&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye.&#x201d; He pointed to the road that lay straight ahead. &#x201c;Take that road.&#x201d;&#x201c;That one?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye. Follow your nose &#x2019;til you come to Willy John McCoubrey&#x2019;s red barn.&#x201d;&#x201c;Red barn. Right.&#x201d;&#x201c;Now you don&#x2019;t turn there.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not at all. Keep right on. You&#x2019;ll see a black-and-white cow in a field&#x2014;unless Willy John has her in the red barn for milking. Now go past her, and take the road to your right.&#x201d; As he spoke, the youth pointed to the left side of the road.Barry felt a mite confused. &#x201c;First right past the black-and-white cow?&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; he said, continuing to point to the left. &#x201c;From there on, it&#x2019;s only a wee doddle. Mind you, sir...&#x201d; He started to mount his rusty machine.

Whether it&#x2019;s the use of <i>literally</i> to mean &#x201c;figuratively&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;by the letter,&#x201d; or the way young people use <i>LOL</i> and <i>like</i>, or business jargon like <i>What&#x2019;s the ask?</i> -- it often seems as if the language is deteriorating before our eyes.</p><p> But the truth is different and a lot less scary, as John McWhorter shows in this delightful and eye-opening exploration of how English has always been in motion and continues to evolve today. Drawing examples from everyday life and employing a generous helping of humor, he shows that these shifts are a natural process common to all languages, and that we should embrace and appreciate these changes, not condemn them.</p><p> <i>Words on the Move</i> opens our eyes to the surprising backstories to the words and expressions we use every day. Did you know that <i>silly</i> once meant &#x201c;blessed&#x201d;? Or that <i>ought</i> was the original past tense of <i>owe</i>? Or that the suffix <i>-ly</i> in adverbs is actually a remnant of the word <i>like</i>? And have you ever wondered why some people from New Orleans sound as if they come from Brooklyn?</p><p> McWhorter encourages us to marvel at the dynamism and resilience of the English language, and his book offers a lively journey through which we discover that words are ever on the move and our lives are all the richer for it.</p></p><p><b>John McWhorter</b> is an associate professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and is the author of more than fifteen books, including <i>The Language Hoax</i>, <i>The Power of Babel</i>, and <i>Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue</i>. He writes for <i>TIME</i>, CNN, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and his articles have also appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, the<i> Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> The Washington Post</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>,<i> </i>and The Daily Beast.<p>&#x201c;John McWhorter&#x2019;s <i>Words on the Move</i> has a deeper point than most language books: it&#x2019;s focused on the ordinary words which do most of the grunt work of communicating, but which we rarely give much thought to. It&#x2019;s full of little puzzles and surprises that stop us in our tracks and make us aware of the gentle breezes that are always blowing our words hither and yon. McWhorter is awfully good at listening to words and at explaining what he hears there, and his book is so brimming with insights that even as a linguist, I found myself stopping every couple of pages to say to myself, &#x2018;Huh&#x2015;I never thought of that.&#x2019; So will you.&#x201d; <br><b>--Geoffrey Nunberg, linguist on NPR&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fresh Air&#x201d; and author of <i>Going Nucular</i> and <i>Ascent of the A-Word</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;If you want to hate on new developments in English, you should at least understand why. With a combination of linguistic erudition and ready wit, John McWhorter takes us on a tour of a thousand years of the history of English, showing how language change is natural, unavoidable, and fascinating.

For a moment it was like being on a roller coaster when you&#x2019;re racing down from the very top. It lasted only two seconds, but that was long enough for me to dump a plateful of mashed potatoes and gravy all over my school uniform. I managed to catch the plate just in time, as my knife and fork clattered to the floor.<br>&#x201c;This stuff tastes like it&#x2019;s been scraped off the floor anyway,&#x201d; said my friend Lesley while I mopped up the damage as well as I could. Of course everyone was looking at me. &#x201c;You can have mine too, if you fancy spreading some more on your blouse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d; As it happens, the blouse of the St. Lennox High School uniform was pretty much the color of mashed potatoes anyway, but you still couldn&#x2019;t miss seeing the remaining globs of my lunch. I buttoned up my dark blue blazer over it.<br>&#x201c;There goes Gwenny, playing with her food again!&#x201d; said Cynthia Dale. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you sit next to me, you mucky pup.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As if I&#x2019;d ever sit next to you of my own free will, Cyn.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a fact, I&#x2019;m afraid, that I did quite often have little accidents with school lunches. Only last week my pudding had hopped out of its dish and landed a few feet away, right in a Year Seven boy&#x2019;s spaghetti carbonara. The week before that I&#x2019;d knocked my cranberry juice over, and everyone at our table was splashed. They looked as if they had measles. And I really couldn&#x2019;t count the number of times the stupid tie that&#x2019;s part of our school uniform had been drenched in sauce, juice, or milk.<br>Only I&#x2019;d never felt dizzy at the same time before.<br>But I was probably just imagining it. There&#x2019;d been too much talk at home recently about dizzy feelings.<br>Not mine, though: my cousin Charlotte&#x2019;s dizzy spells. Charlotte, beautiful and immaculate as ever, was sitting right there next to Cynthia, gracefully scooping mashed potatoes into her delicate mouth.<br>The entire family was on tenterhooks, waiting for Charlotte to have a dizzy fit. On most days, my grandmother, Lady Arista, asked Charlotte how she was feeling every ten minutes. My aunt Glenda, Charlotte&#x2019;s mother, filled the ten-minute gap by asking the same thing in between Lady Arista&#x2019;s interrogations.<br>And whenever Charlotte said that she didn&#x2019;t feel dizzy, Lady Arista&#x2019;s lips tightened and Aunt Glenda sighed. Or sometimes the other way around.<br>The rest of us&#x2014;my mum, my sister Caroline, my brother Nick, and Great-aunt Maddy&#x2014;rolled our eyes. Of course it was exciting to have someone with a time-travel gene in the family, but as the days went by, the excitement kind of wore off. Sometimes we felt that all the fuss being made over Charlotte was just too much.<br>Charlotte herself usually hid her feelings behind a mysterious Mona Lisa smile. In her place, I wouldn&#x2019;t have known whether to be excited or worried if dizzy feelings failed to show up. Well, to be honest, I&#x2019;d probably have been pleased. I was more the timid sort. I liked peace and quiet.<br>&#x201c;Something will happen sooner or later,&#x201d; Lady Arista said every day. &#x201c;And we must be ready.&#x201d;<br>Sure enough, something did happen after lunch, in Mr. Whitman&#x2019;s history class. I&#x2019;d left the canteen feeling hungry. I&#x2019;d found a black hair in my dessert&#x2014;apple crumble with custard&#x2014;and I couldn&#x2019;t be sure if it was one of my own hairs or a lunch lady&#x2019;s. Anyway, I didn&#x2019;t fancy the crumble after that.<br>Mr. Whitman gave us back the history test we&#x2019;d taken last week. &#x201c;You obviously prepared well for it. Especially Charlotte. An A-plus for you, Charlotte.&#x201d;<br>Charlotte stroked a strand of her glossy red hair back from her face and said, &#x201c;Oh, my!&#x201d; as if the result came as a surprise to her. Even though she always had top marks in everything.<br>But Lesley and I were pleased with our own grades this time, too. We each had an A-minus, although our &#x201c;preparation&#x201d; had consisted of eating crisps and ice cream while we watched Cate Blanchett in&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth</i>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>&nbsp;on DVD. We did pay attention in history class, though, which I&#x2019;m afraid couldn&#x2019;t be said for all our other courses.<br>Mr. Whitman&#x2019;s classes were so intriguing that you couldn&#x2019;t help listening. Mr. Whitman himself was also very interesting. Most of the girls were secretly&#x2014;or not so secretly&#x2014;in love with him. So was our geography teacher, Mrs. Counter. She went bright red whenever Mr. Whitman passed her. And he&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;terribly good-looking. All the girls thought so, except Lesley. She thought Mr. Whitman looked like a cartoon squirrel.<br>&#x201c;Whenever he looks at me with those big brown eyes, I feel like giving him a nut,&#x201d; she said. She even started calling the squirrels running around in the park Mr. Whitmans. The silly thing is that somehow it was infectious, and now, whenever a squirrel scuttled past me, I always said, &#x201c;Oh, look at that cute, fat little Mr. Whitman!&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;m sure it was the squirrel business that made Lesley and me the only girls in the class who weren&#x2019;t crazy about Mr. Whitman. I kept trying to fall in love with him (if only because the boys in our class were all somehow totally childish), but it was no good. The squirrel comparison had lodged itself in my mind and wouldn&#x2019;t go away. I mean, how can you feel romantic about a squirrel?<br>Cynthia had started the rumor that when he was studying, Mr. Whitman had worked as a male model on the side. By way of evidence, she&#x2019;d cut an ad out of a glossy magazine, with a picture showing a man not unlike Mr. Whitman lathering himself with shower gel.<br>Apart from Cynthia, however, no one thought Mr. Whitman was the man in the shower-gel ad. The model had a dimple in his chin, and Mr. Whitman didn&#x2019;t.<br>The boys in our class didn&#x2019;t think Mr. Whitman was so great. Gordon Gelderman, in particular, couldn&#x2019;t stand him. Because before Mr. Whitman came to teach in our school, all the girls in our class were in love with Gordon. Including me, I have to admit, but I was only eleven at the time and Gordon was still quite cute. Now, at sixteen, he was just stupid. And his voice had been in a permanent state of breaking for the last two years. Unfortunately, the mixture of squealing and growling still didn&#x2019;t keep him from spewing nonsense all the time.<br>He got very upset about getting an F on the history test. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s discrimination, Mr. Whitman. I deserve a B at least. You can&#x2019;t give me bad marks just because I&#x2019;m a boy.&#x201d;<br>Mr. Whitman took Gordon&#x2019;s test back from him, turned a page, and read out, &#x201c;Elizabeth I was so ugly that she couldn&#x2019;t get a husband. So everyone called her the Ugly Virgin.&#x201d;<br>The class giggled.<br>&#x201c;Well? I&#x2019;m right, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; Gordon defended himself. &#x201c;I mean, look at her pop-eyes and her thin lips and that weird hairstyle.&#x201d;<br>We&#x2019;d gone to study the pictures of the Tudors in the National Portrait Gallery, and in those paintings, sure enough, Queen Elizabeth I didn&#x2019;t look much like Cate Blanchett. But first, maybe people in those days thought thin lips and big noses were the last word in chic, and second, her clothes were really wonderful. Third, no, Elizabeth I didn&#x2019;t have a husband, but she had a lot of affairs, among them one with Sir&nbsp;... oh, what was his name? Anyway, Clive Owen played him in the second film with Cate Blanchett.<br>&#x201c;She was known as the Virgin Queen,&#x201d; Mr. Whitman told Gordon, &#x201c;because...&#x201d; He paused and looked anxiously at Charlotte. &#x201c;Are you feeling all right, Charlotte? Do you have a headache?&#x201d;<br>Everyone looked at Charlotte, who had her head in her hands. &#x201c;I feel&nbsp;... I just feel dizzy,&#x201d; she said, looking at me. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s going round and round.&#x201d;<br>I took a deep breath. So here we go, I thought. Lady Arista and Aunt Glenda would be over the moon.<br>&#x201c;Wow, cool,&#x201d; whispered Lesley. &#x201c;Is she going to turn all transparent now?&#x201d; Although Lady Arista had repeatedly told us that under no circumstances were we ever to tell any outsider what was special about our family, I&#x2019;d decided to ignore the ban when it came to Lesley. After all, she was my very best friend, and best friends don&#x2019;t have secrets from each other.<br>Since I&#x2019;d known Charlotte (which in fact was all my life), she&#x2019;d always seemed somewhat helpless. But I knew what to do. Goodness knows Aunt Glenda had told me often enough.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take Charlotte home,&#x201d; I told Mr. Whitman, as I stood up. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br>Mr. Whitman&#x2019;s gaze was fixed on Charlotte. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a good idea, Gwyneth,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope you feel better soon, Charlotte.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Charlotte. On the way to the door, she swayed slightly. &#x201c;Coming, Gwenny?&#x201d;<br>I grabbed her arm. For the first time I felt quite important to Charlotte. It was a nice feeling to be needed for a change.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget to phone and tell me all about it,&#x201d; Lesley whispered as we passed her.<br>Feeling slightly better outside the classroom, Charlotte wanted to fetch some things from her locker, but I held her firmly by the sleeve. &#x201c;Not now, Charlotte! We have to get home as fast as possible. Lady Arista says&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone again,&#x201d; said Charlotte.<br>&#x201c;So? It could come back any moment.&#x201d; Charlotte let me steer her the other way. &#x201c;Where did I put that chalk?&#x201d; As we walked on, I searched my jacket pocket. &#x201c;Oh, good, here it is. And my mobile. Shall I call home? Are you scared? Silly question, sorry. I&#x2019;m so excited.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay...</p><h2>Torch-Fired Enamel Jewelry: A Workshop in Painting with Fire</h2><p><p><i>Torch-Fired Enamel Jewelry</i> combines beading and wire-working techniques with the intense beauty of torch-fired enameled beads.

In this outing, not only is Miss Julia questioning the validity of her wedding chapel marriage, but she's also assisting Hazel Marie, her late husband's mistress, with a beauty contest for Miss Abbot County Sheriff's Department. The usual luscious ingredients of Southern manners, sex, and modern and traditional values collide with human foibles, causing hilarious results. Darlow is splendid as she personifies Little Lloyd (a 9-year-old white boy), Miss Lillian and Leticia (Julia's African-American maid and her granddaughter), Mr. Pickens (Hazel Marie's detective/beau), and Sam (Miss Julia's intended) plus the young, unformed beauty pageant contestants. Darlow's skill lies in each character being splendid without overdoing the accent. One of Ross's best for old--and new--fans. S.G.B.

He also attributes it to Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P�rigord (1754-1838), who was perhaps the first professional civil servant.

He lives in New York City.1<br><br>One June day in the mid-fifties Tom Pasmore, a ten-year-old boy with skin as golden as if he had been born with a good fourth-day suntan, jumped down from a milk cart and found himself in a part of Mill Walk he had never seen before. A sense of urgency, of impendingness, had awakened him with the screams that came from his mother's bedroom and clung to him during the whole anxious, jittery day, and when he waved his thanks to the driver, this feeling intensified like a bright light directed into his eyes. He thought of hopping back on the milk cart, but it was already jingling away down Calle Burleigh. Tom squinted into the bright dusty haze through which passed a steady double stream of bicycles, horse carts, and automobiles. It was late afternoon, and the light had a molten, faintly reddish cast that suddenly reminded him of panels from comic books: fires and explosions and men falling through the air.<br><br>In the next moment this busy scene seemed to suppress beneath it another, more essential scene, every particle of which overflowed with an intense, unbearable beauty. It was as if great engines had kicked into life beneath the surface of what he could see. For a moment Tom could not move. Nature itself seemed to have awakened, overflowing with being.<br><br>Tom stood transfixed in the heavy, slanting reddish light and the dust rising from the roadway.<br><br>He was used to the quieter, narrower streets of the island's far east end, and his glimpse of a mysterious glory might have been no more than a product of the change from Eastern Shore Road. What he was looking at was another world, one he had never seen before. He had no exact idea of how to get back to the far east end and the great houses of Eastern Shore Road, and less idea of why he was searching for a certain address. A bicycle bell gave a rasping cry like the chirp of a cricket, a horse's ironclad hoof struck the packed dirt of Calle Burleigh, and all the sounds of the wide avenue reached Tom once again. He realized that he had been holding his breath, and that his eyes were blurry with tears. Already far down the avenue, the milk driver tilted toward the sun and the sturdy brown cob that pulled his cart. The ching-ching-ching of the bottles had melted into the general hum. Tom wiped moisture from his face. He was not at all sure of what had just happened-another world? Be�neath this world?<br><br>Tom continued to melt back into the scene before him, won�dering if this experience, still present as a kind of weightlessness about his heart, was what had been impending all during the day. He had been pushed-pushed right out of his frame. For an elastically long second or two-for as long as the world had trembled and overflowed with being-he had been in the other world, the one beneath. <br><br>Now he smiled, distracted by this notion from Jules Verne or Robert Heinlein. He stepped back on the sidewalk and looked east. Both sides of the wide avenue were filled with horses and vehicles, at least half of which were bicycles. This varied crowd moved through the haze of light and dust and extended as far as Tom could see.<br><br>It seemed to Tom that he had never really known what the phrase "rush hour" meant. On Eastern Shore Road, rush hour consisted of a car or two honking at children to get out of the street. Once Tom had seen a servant ride a bicycle straight into the bicycle of another servant, spilling clean white laundry all over the warm red brick of the road-that was rush hour. Of course Tom had been in his father's office in the business district; he had seen the midday traffic on Calle Hoffmann; and he had gone to the harbor, Mill Key, with his parents and passed be�neath rows of palms in the company of jitneys and cabs and broughams; and at Mill Key he had seen the conveyances drawn up to take the new arrivals downtown to their hotels, the Pforz�heimer or the St. Alwyn. (Strictly speaking, Mill Walk had no tourist hotels. The Pforzheimer took in bankers and moneymen, and the St. Alwyn catered to drummers, traveling musicians like Glenroy Breakstone and the wondrous Targets, gamblers, that class of person.) He had never been in the business district at the close of a workday, and he had never seen anything like the sweep and the variety of the traffic moving east and west, primarily west, toward Shurz Bay and Elm Cove, on Calle Bur�leigh. It looked as though everyone on the island had simulta�neously decided to dash off to the island's other side. For a moment of panic that seemed oddly connected to the wonderful experience he had just undergone, Tom wondered if he would ever be able to find his way back again.<br><br>But he did not want to go home, not until he had found a certain house, and he imagined that when the time came he would find someone as accommodating as the milk driver, who in spite of the NO PASSENGERS ALLOWED sign at the front of the cart had invited him to hop on board and then quizzed him about girlfriends all during the long trip west-Tom was big for his age, and with his blond hair and dark eyes and eyebrows he looked more like thirteen than ten. This thing had been nagging at him all day, making it impossible to read more than a page or two at a time, driving him from his bedroom to the living room to the white wicker furniture on the porch, until at last he had resorted to walking back and forth on the big front lawn, wondering vaguely if Mrs. Thielman's Sam might run into Mrs. Langenheim's Jenny again, or if a crazy drunk might wander into the street and start yelling and throwing rocks, as had happened two days before.<br><br>The funny thing was that though the feeling of glory, over�flowing being, had passed, the other feeling did not fade with it but lingered, as powerful as ever. <br><br>He was being pushed, being moved.<br><br>Tom turned around to get a better fix on this strange area, and found himself looking between two sturdy wooden houses, each placed atop its own narrow slanting lawn like a nut on a cupcake, at another row of houses set behind them on the next street. Tall elms arched over this second street, which seemed as quiet as Eastern Shore Road. The houses beneath the elms were one notch less impressive than those on Calle Burleigh. Tom instantly understood that this second street was forbidden territory. This information was not ambiguous. The little street might as well have had a chain-link fence around it and a sign commanding him to KEEP OUT: a spear of lightning would sizzle right down out of the sky and impale him if he entered that street. <br><br>The imaginary light that shone on his face became stronger and hotter. He had been right to come all this way. He stepped sideways, and a little two-story wooden house painted a very dark brown on the top story and a bright buttery yellow on the bottom came into view on the forbidden street.<br><br>Two days earlier, Tom had been lying on the striped yellow chaise in the living room reading Jules Verne, inside the imag�inary but total safety of words on a page organized into sentences and paragraphs-a world both fixed and flowing, always the same and always moving and always open to him. This was escape. It was safety. Then a loud noise, the sound of something striking the side of the house, had pulled him up on the yellow chaise as roughly as a hand shaking him from sleep. A moment later Tom heard a blurry voice shouting obscenities in the street. "Bastard! Shithead!" Another rock crashed against the side of the house. Tom had jumped from the chaise and moved to the front window, unconsciously keeping his place in the book with his index finger. A middle-aged man with a thick waist and short, thinning brown hair was weaving back and forth on the sidewalk beside a slumped canvas bag from which a few large stones had spilled. The man held a baseball-sized rock in each hand. "Do me like this!" he yelled. "Think you can treat Wendell Hasek like he's some kind of jerk!" He turned all the way around and nearly fell down. Then he rounded his shoulders like an ape and squinted furiously at the two houses-each with great columns, round turrets, and twin parapets-across the street. One of these, the Jacobs house, was empty because Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs had gone to the mainland for the summer; the other was inhab�ited by Lamont von Heilitz, a fantastic and sour old man who lived in the shadows and echoes of some vague ancient scandal. Mr. von Heilitz always wore gloves, pale grey or lemon yellow, changed clothes five or six times a day, had never worked a single day in his whole life, and darted out on his porch to yell at children who threatened to step on his lawn. The chaos-man hurled one of his rocks toward the von Heilitz house. The rock banged against the rough stone side ofthe house, missing a large leaded window by only a few inches. Tom had wondered if Mr. von Heilitz would materialize on his front porch shaking a fist in a smooth grey glove. Then the man twitched his head as if to dislodge a fly, staggered back a few steps, and bent down for another rock, either forgetting the spare in his left hand or feeling that one rock was simply not enough. He thrust his hand into the canvas sack and began rooting around, presumably for a rock of the proper dimensions. He wore wash pants and a khaki shirt unbuttoned half of the way down the bulge of his stomach. His suntan ended at an abrupt line just below his neck-the protruding stomach was a stark, unhealthy white. The chaos-man lost his balance as he leaned down deeper into the bag and toppled over on his face. When he got himself up on his knees again, blood covered the lower half of his face. He was squinting now at Tom's house, and Tom stepped back from the window.<br><br>Then Tom's grandfather, Glendenning Upshaw, the most imposing figure in his life, came heavily down the stairs in his black suit, passed his grandson without acknowledging him, and slammed the front door behind him. Tom instinctively knew that the chaos-man had come for his grandfather and no one else, and that only his grandfather could deal with him. Soon his grandfather appeared, making his way down the walkway to�ward the sidewalk, thumping the tip of his unfurled umbrella against the pavement. The intruder shouted at Tom's grand�father, but Tom's grandfather did not shout back. The intruder fired a rock into Gloria Pasmore's roses. He fell down again as soon as Tom's grandfather reached the sidewalk. To Tom's as�tonishment, his grandfather picked the man up, taking care not to bloody his suit, and shook him like a broken toy. Tom's mother began yelling incoherently from an upstairs window and then abruptly stopped, as if she had just taken in that the whole neighborhood could hear her. Tom's father, Victor Pasmore, came down and joined Tom at the window, staring out with a careful neutrality that excluded Tom. Tom slipped out of the living room, index finger still inserted between pages 153 and 154 of Journey to the Center of the Earth, moved through the empty hall, and continued on out through the open door. He feared that his grandfather had killed the chaos-man with the Uncle Henry knife he always carried in his trouser pocket. The heat was the muscular heat of the Caribbean in June, a steady downpouring ninety degrees. Tom went down the path to the sidewalk, and for a moment both the chaos-man and his grand�father stared at him. His grandfather waved him off and turned away, but the other man, Wendell Hasek, hunched his shoulders again and continued to stare fixedly at Tom. His grandfather pushed him backwards, and Hasek jerked away. "You know me," he said. "Are you gonna pretend you don't?" His grand�father marched the man to the end of the block and disappeared. Tom looked back at his house and saw his father shaking his head at him. His grandfather came trudging back around the corner of Eastern Shore Road and An Die Blumen, chewing his lip as he walked. The determination in his slow step suggested that he had pitched the chaos-man off the edge of the world. He glanced up and saw Tom, frowned, looked down at the sparkling sidewalk.<br><br>When he got back in the house he went wordlessly upstairs with Tom's father. Tom watched him go, and when both his father and grandfather had closed his mother's bedroom door behind them, he went into the study and pulled the Mill Walk telephone book onto his lap and turned the pages until he came to Wendell Hasek's name. Loud voices floated down the stairs. His grandfather said "our" or "hour."</p><h2>Lily and the Octopus</h2><p><b>&#x201c;<i>Lily and the Octopus</i> is the dog book you must read this summer...a profound experience.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <br>Combining the emotional depth of <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i> with the magical spirit of <i>The Life of Pi</i>, <i>Lily and the Octopus </i>is an epic adventure of the heart.<br><br>When you sit down with <i>Lily and the Octopus</i>, you will be taken on an unforgettable ride.<br> <br>The magic of this novel is in the read, and we don&#x2019;t want to spoil it by giving away too many details.<br> <br>We can tell you that this is a story about that special someone: the one you trust, the one you can&#x2019;t live without.<br> <br>For Ted Flask, that someone special is his aging companion Lily, who happens to be a dog.<br> <br><i>Lily and the Octopus </i>reminds us how it feels to love fiercely, how difficult it can be to let go, and how the fight for those we love is the greatest fight of all.<br> <br>Remember the last book you told someone they <i>had </i>to read?<br> <br><i>Lily and the Octopus</i> is the next one.</p><p>Steven Rowley has worked as a freelance writer, newspaper columnist, and screenwriter.

Follow him on social media @MrStevenRowley.Lily and the Octopus <br>It&#x2019;s Thursday the first time I see it. I know that it&#x2019;s Thursday because Thursday nights are the nights my dog, Lily, and I set aside to talk about boys we think are cute. She&#x2019;s twelve in actual years, which is eighty-four in dog years. I&#x2019;m forty-two, which is two hundred and ninety-four in dog years&#x2014;but like a really young two hundred and ninety-four, because I&#x2019;m in pretty good shape and a lot of people tell me I could pass for two hundred and thirty-eight, which is actually thirty-four. I say this about our ages because we&#x2019;re both a little immature and tend to like younger guys. We get into long debates over the Ryans. I&#x2019;m a Gosling man, whereas she&#x2019;s a Reynolds gal, even though she can&#x2019;t name a single movie of his that she would ever watch twice. (We dropped Phillipe years ago over a disagreement as to how to pronounce his name. FILL-a-pea? Fill-AH-pay? Also because he doesn&#x2019;t work that much anymore.) Then there&#x2019;s the Matts and the Toms. We go back and forth between Bomer and Damon and Brady and Hardy depending on what kind of week it has been. And finally the Bradleys, Cooper and Milton, the latter of whom is technically way older and long dead and I&#x2019;m not sure why my dog keeps bringing him up other than she loves board games, which we usually play on Fridays.<br> <br>Anyhow, this particular Thursday we are discussing the Chrises: Hemsworth and Evans and Pine. It&#x2019;s when Lily suggests offhandedly we also include Chris Pratt that I notice the octopus. It&#x2019;s not often you see an octopus up close, let alone in your living room, let alone perched on your dog&#x2019;s head like a birthday party hat, so I&#x2019;m immediately taken aback. I have a good view of it, as Lily and I are sitting on opposite sides of the couch, each with a pillow, me sitting Indian style, her perched more like the MGM lion.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lily!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to include Chris Pratt, it was just a suggestion,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;what&#x2019;s that on your head?&#x201d; I ask. Two of the octopus&#x2019;s arms hang down her face like chin straps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, where? There. Over your temple on the right side.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lily pauses. She looks at me for a moment, our eyes locked on each other. She breaks my gaze only to glance upward at the octopus. &#x201c;Oh. That.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I immediately lean in and grab her snout, the way I used to when she was a pup and would bark too much, so excited by the very existence of each new thing encountered that she had to sing her enthusiasm with sharp, staccato notes: LOOK! AT! THIS! IT! IS! THE! MOST! AMAZING! THING! I&#x2019;VE! EVER! SEEN! IT&#x2019;S! A! GREAT! TIME! TO! BE! ALIVE! Once, when we first lived together, in the time it took me to shower she managed to relocate all of my size-thirteen shoes to the top of the staircase three rooms away. When I asked her why, her reply was pure conviction: THESE! THINGS! YOU! PUT! ON! FEET! SHOULD! BE! CLOSER! TO! THE! STAIRS! So full of ebullience and ideas.<br> <br>I pull her closer to me and turn her head to the side so I can get a good, long look. She gives me the most side-eye she can muster in annoyance, disgusted with both the molestation and unwanted attention, and my gaucheness as a big, stupid human man.<br> <br>The octopus has a good grip and clings tightly over her eye. It takes me a minute, but I gather my nerve and poke it. It&#x2019;s harder than I would have imagined. Less like a water balloon, more like . . . bone. It feels subcutaneous, yet there it is, out in the open for all to see. I count its arms, turning Lily&#x2019;s head around to the back, and sure enough, there are eight. The octopus looks angry as much as out of place. Aggressive perhaps is a better word. Like it is announcing itself and would like the room. I&#x2019;m not going to lie. It&#x2019;s as frightening as it is confounding. I saw a video somewhere, sometime, of an octopus that camouflaged itself so perfectly along the ocean floor that it was completely undetectable until some unfortunate whelk or crab or snail came along and it emerged, striking with deadly precision. I remember going back and watching the video again and again, trying to locate the octopus in hiding. After countless viewings I could acknowledge its presence, sense its energy, its lurking, its intent to pounce, even if I couldn&#x2019;t entirely make it out in form. Once you had seen it, you couldn&#x2019;t really unsee it&#x2014;even as you remained impressed with its ability to hide so perfectly in plain sight.<br> <br>This is like that.<br> <br>Now that I&#x2019;ve seen it, I can&#x2019;t unsee it, and the octopus transforms Lily&#x2019;s entire face. A face that has always been so handsome to me, a noble and classic dog profile, betrayed only slightly by a dachshund&#x2019;s ridiculous body. Still, that face! Perfect in its symmetry. When you pulled her ears back it was like a small bowling pin covered in the softest mahogany fur. But now she looks less like a bowling pin in shape and more like a worn-down bowling pin in occupation; her head sports a lump as if it had actually been the number-one pin in a ten-pin formation.<br> <br>Lily snorts at me twice with flared nostrils and I realize I&#x2019;m still holding her snout. I let go of her, knowing she is seething at the indignity of it all.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it,&#x201d; she says, tucking her head to gnaw at an itch on her stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I do want to talk about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mostly I want to talk about how it could be possible that I&#x2019;ve never seen it before. How I could be responsible for every aspect of her daily life and well-being&#x2014;food, water, exercise, toys, chews, inside, outside, medication, elimination, entertainment, snuggling, affection, love&#x2014;and not notice that one side of her head sports an octopus, alarmingly increasing it in size. The octopus is a master of disguise, I remind myself; its intent is to stay hidden. But even as I say this silently in my head I wonder why I&#x2019;m letting myself so easily off the hook.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a sigh. An exhale. When Lily was younger, in her sleep she would make a similar noise, usually right before her legs would start racing, the preamble to a beautiful dream about chasing squirrels or birds or pounding the warm sand on an endless golden beach. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I think of Ethan Hawke answering the standard questionnaire inspired by Bernard Pivot that ended every episode of Inside the Actors Studio:<br> <br>&#x201c;What sound or noise do you love?&#x201d;<br> <br>Puppies sighing, Ethan had said.<br> <br>Yes! Such a wonderful juxtaposition, sighing puppies. As if warm, sleeping puppies felt anything lamentable or had weariness or exasperations to sigh over. And yet they sighed all the time! Exhalations of sweet, innocent breath. But this sigh is different. Subtly. To the untrained ear it might not be noticeable, but I know Lily about as well as I think it&#x2019;s possible to know another living thing, so I notice it. There&#x2019;s a heaviness to it. A creakiness. There are cares in her world; there is weight on her shoulders.<br> <br>I ask her again. &#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her answer comes slowly, after great pause and consideration. &#x201c;Sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>The very best thing about dogs is how they just know when you need them most, and they&#x2019;ll drop everything that they&#x2019;re doing to sit with you awhile. I don&#x2019;t need to press Lily further. I can do what she has done for me countless times, through heartbreak and illness and depression and days of general uneasiness and malaise. I can sit with her quietly, our bodies touching just enough to generate warmth, to share the vibrating energy of all living things, until our breathing slows and falls into the parallel rhythm it always does when we have our quietest sits.<br> <br>I pinch the skin on the back of her neck as I imagine her mother once did to carry her when she was a pup.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a wind coming,&#x201d; I tell her. Staring down the octopus as much as I dare, I fear there&#x2019;s more truth to that statement than I&#x2019;d like. Mostly I am setting Lily up to deliver her favorite line from Elizabeth: The Golden Age. Neither of us has actually seen the film, but they played this exchange endlessly in the commercials back when it was in theaters and we both would collapse in fits of laughter at the sound of Cate Blanchett bellowing and carrying on as the Virgin Queen. My dog does the best Cate Blanchett impression.<br> <br>Lily perks up just a bit and delivers her response on cue: &#x201c;I, too, can command the wind, sir! I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me! Let them come with the armies of hell; they will not pass!&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a good effort, one she makes for me. But if I&#x2019;m being honest, it isn&#x2019;t her best. Instinctually she probably already knows what is fast becoming clear to me: she is the whelk; she is the crab; she is the snail.<br> <br>The octopus is hungry.<br> <br>And it is going to have her.</p><h2>Putinism: Russia and Its Future with the West</h2><p><p>There is no question that tensions between Russia and America are on the rise. The forced annexation of Crimea, the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, and the Russian government's treatment of homosexuals have created diplomatic standoffs and led to a volley of economic sanctions. In America, much of the blame for Russia's recent hostility has fallen on steely-eyed President Vladimir Putin and many have begun to wonder if they we are witnessing the rebirth of Cold War-style dictatorship.</p><p>Not so fast, argues veteran historian Walter Laqueur.<br>For two decades, Laqueur has been ahead of the curve, predicting events in post-Soviet Russia with uncanny accuracy. In <i>Putinism</i>, he deftly demonstrates how three long-standing pillars of Russian ideology-a strong belief in the Orthodox Church, a sense of Eurasian "manifest destiny," and a fear of foreign enemies-continue to exert a powerful influence on the Russian populous. In fact, today's Russians have more in common with their counterparts from 1904 than 1954 and Putin is much more a servant of his people than we might think.<br>Topical and provocative, <i>Putinism</i> contains much more than historical analysis. Looking to the future, Laqueur explains how America's tendency to see Russia as a Cold War relic is dangerous and premature. Russia can and will challenge the West and it is in our best interest to figure out exactly who we are facing-and what they want-before it is too late.</p></p><p>WALTER LAQUEUR was the director of the Institute of Contemporary History in London for 30 years. Concurrently, he served as chairman of the International Research Council of CSIS in Washington, DC. He was also a professor at Georgetown University and is the author of more than 25 books including <i>After the Fall </i>(2012) and <i>The Last Days of Europe </i>(2007). He has had articles published in <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, </i>and countless other newspapers worldwide.<p>&#x201c;An aptly timed and much needed look at the mercurial master of the Kremlin&#x201d; &#x2015;Peter Baker, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;An erudite and unsettling but convincing argument that the new Russia is a dictatorship 'approved by the majority as long as the going is good,' and if Putin were to vanish today, his successor would make few changes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Laqueur is grimly convincing in lowering expectations that Russia will become genuinely democratic any time soon. This thorough examination of all aspects of modern Russian society and culture makes an excellent addition to recent literature on Putin-era Russia.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Big-picture analysis is always good, and Walter Laqueur, dean of American Russia watchers, excels at it.&#x201d; &#x2015;James S.

The work narrates a linear history of pre-Saxon Britain, from its founding by Trojan exiles to the loss of native British (Celtic) sovereignty in the face of Germanic invaders. Along the way, Geoffrey introduces readers to such familiar figures as King Lear, Cymbeline, Vortigern, the prophet Merlin, and a host of others. Most importantly, he provides the first birth-to-death account of the life of King Arthur. His focus on that king&#x2019;s reign sparked the vogue for Arthurian romance throughout medieval Europe that has continued into the twenty-first century. </p> <p> This new translation is the first in over forty years and the first to be based on the Bern manuscript, now considered the authoritative Latin text. It is accompanied by an introduction that highlights the significance of Geoffrey&#x2019;s work in his own day and focuses in particular on the ambiguous status of the text between history and fiction. Appendices include historical sources, early responses to the <em>History</em>, and other medieval writings on King Arthur and Merlin. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Michael A.

Michael A. Faletra accompanies his smooth, modern translation with an intelligent selection of supporting primary material from the Latin and Welsh traditions. The decision to include a complete translation of Geoffrey&#x2019;s <em>Life of Merlin</em> makes the book particularly attractive.

Faletra&#x2019;s work will be of service to the scholar, the teacher, and the general reader. The book&#x2019;s four appendices contain fresh translations by Faletra of the major sources and analogues to Geoffrey&#x2019;s history, including Geoffrey&#x2019;s own <em>Life of Merlin</em>. Faletra&#x2019;s up-to-date introduction, notes, and bibliography enable the reader to follow recent scholarly discussion and debate surrounding one of the most influential, and controversial authors of the Middle Ages.&#x201d; &#x2015; Michael J. Curley, University of Puget Sound </p> <p> &#x201c;This book is a treasure-trove for teachers and students of the King Arthur legend. A fresh, up-to-date translation of Geoffrey&#x2019;s masterpiece is nice to have, but better yet is a good version of the Vita Merlini (harder to find) and Faletra&#x2019;s choice of excerpts from Gildas, the <em>Historia Brittonum</em>, some Welsh Arthur and Merlin verses, and early comments on Geoffrey&#x2019;s enterprise. For anyone who wants to teach the origins of the Arthur story, it is immensely useful to have all this between two covers.&#x201d; &#x2015; Judith P.

Lewis</h2><p>A journey through the ecclesiastical year with Christianity&#x2019;s most eloquent and inspiring spokesman. <br>&#x201c;A potent anthology&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times). <br>Edited and with a Preface by Walter Hooper.<br></p><p>"A potent anthology."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i> "C.S. Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the good man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way."--Anthony Burgess, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> &nbsp; The church year, as described by C.S. Lewis's infamous devil, Screwtape, is always "The Same Old Thing." In answer to this, Father Walter Hooper, editor of this edition, draws from the rich canon of Lewis's work and presents these eloquent, clear readings as meditations appropriate for every day of the Christian year. Each entry, other than those for saints' days and holy days, is given a title to set the theme, such as "Half-Hearted Creatures," "Two Kinds of Good and Bad," and "The Humblest Love." Hooper illuminates his belief that C.S. Lewis was "one of the most realistic Christians we are ever likely to meet" by choosing readings that explore faith and morality together with joy, which, as Lewis wrote, "is the serious business of heaven." &nbsp; "The point about reading C.S. Lewis is that he makes you sure, whatever you believe, that religion accepted or rejected means something extremely serious, demanding the entire energy of the mind."--<i>Harper's</i> &nbsp; C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) gained international renown for an impressive array of beloved works both popular and scholarly: literary criticism, children's literature, fantasy literature, and numerous books on theology.

Deep grief takes him away from all he knows on a directionless trek along the Cornish coast. Ragged and dirty after six weeks of traveling, Lynley discovers the body of a young climber at the bottom of a cliff. With flair and style Charles Keating voices Lynley and the large number of Cornish locals, from police to the mind-boggling numbers of suspects. However, there are so many characters and subplots, so many strands to weave together, that Keating&#39;s precise interpretations and intelligent narration would have been better served by an unabridged production.

In this Library of America volume are presented the first two novels and a little-known collection of biographical sketches by the man about whom H. L. Mencken said, &#x201c;American writing, before and after his time, differed almost as much as biology before and after Darwin.&#x201d;<br><br>Dreiser grew up poor in a series of small Indiana towns, in a large German Catholic family dominated by his father&#x2019;s religious fervor. At seventeen he moved to Chicago and eventually became a newspaper reporter there and in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and New York. Reaction to his first book,&nbsp;<i>Sister Carrie</i>&nbsp;(1900), was not encouraging, and after suffering a nervous breakdown, he went on to a successful career editing magazines. In 1910 he resumed writing, and over the next fifteen years published fourteen volumes of fiction, drama, travel, autobiography, and essays.<br><br>&#x201c;Dreiser&#x2019;s first great novel,&nbsp;<i>Sister Carrie . . .&nbsp;</i>came to housebound and airless America like a great free Western wind, and to our stuffy domesticity gave us the first fresh air since Mark Twain and Whitman,&#x201d; Sinclair Lewis declared in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1930. Carrie Meeber, an eighteen-year-old small-town girl drawn to bustling Chicago, becomes the passionless mistress of a good-humored traveling salesman and then of an infatuated saloon manager who leaves his family and elopes with her to New York. Dreiser&#x2019;s brilliant, panoramic rendering of the two cities&#x2019; fashionable theaters and restaurants, luxurious hotels and houses of commerce, alongside their unemployment, labor violence, homelessness, degradation, and despair makes this the first urban novel on a grand scale.<br><br>In a 1911 review, H. L. Mencken wrote, &#x201c;<i>Jennie Gerhardt</i>&nbsp;is the best American novel I have ever read, with the lonesome but Himalayan exception of&nbsp;<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.&#x201d; Beautiful, vital, generous, but morally na�ve and unconscious of social conventions, Jennie is a working-class woman who emerges superior to the succession of men who exploit her. There are no villains in this novel; in Dreiser&#x2019;s view, everyone is victimized by the desires that the world excites but can never satisfy.<br><br>Dreiser&#x2019;s embracing compassion is felt in&nbsp;<i>Twelve Men</i>&nbsp;(1919), a collection of portraits of men he knew and admired. They range from &#x201c;My Brother Paul&#x201d; (Paul Dresser, vaudeville musical comedian and composer of &#x201c;On the Banks of the Wabash&#x201d; and &#x201c;My Gal Sal&#x201d;) to &#x201c;Culhane, the Solid Man,&#x201d; a sanatorium owner and former wrestler.

After a poor and difficult childhood, Dreiser broke into newspaper work in Chicago in 1892. A successful career as a magazine writer in New York during the late 1890s was followed by his first novel, <b>Sister Carrie</b> (1900). When this work made little impact, Dreiser published no fiction until <b>Jennie Gerhardt</b> in 1911. There then followed a decade and a half of major work in a number of literary forms, which was capped in 1925 by <b>An American Tragedy</b>, a novel that brought him universal acclaim.

"There is an unaccountable solace that fierce landscapes offer to the soul. They heal, as well as mirror, the brokeness we find within." It is this apparent paradox that lies at the heart of this remarkable book: that inhuman landscapes should be the source of spiritual comfort. Lane shows that the very indifference of the wilderness can release us from the demands of the endlessly anxious ego, teach us to ignore the inessential in our own lives, and enable us to transcend the "false self" that is ever-obsessed with managing impressions. Drawing upon the wisdom of St. John of the Cross, Meister Eckhardt, Simone Weil, Edward Abbey, and many other Christian and non-Christian writers, Lane also demonstrates how those of us cut off from the wilderness might "make some desert" in our lives.<br> Written with vivid intelligence, narrative ease, and a gracefulness that is itself a comfort, <em>The Solace of Fierce Landscapes</em> gives us not only a description but a "performance" of an ancient and increasingly relevant spiritual tradition.</p><p>The great religions of the world were nourished in mountains, nearly all of them born in the deserts but raised in the cool highland air. Belden Lane, a professor of theological studies, explores the role of these "fierce landscapes" in the development of the human spirit, and he travels firsthand to many of them, notably Mount Sinai and the deserts of the American Southwest, where seekers holy and profane have traveled before. "Desert and mountain places," he writes, "located on the margins of society, are locations of choice in luring God's people to a deeper understanding of who they are." Just so, and this modest book yields a deeper understanding of wild lands. <i>--Greg McNamee</i><br><strong>Belden C.

Campbell's career reached its zenith in the early 1970s, when he had his own TV show born of <i>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</i>. The parent show, of course, went down for political reasons, which Campbell--and coauthor Carter, a straightforward stylist--talk about with some clarity. Campbell's own downward spiral late in the 1970s followed an unfortunately predictable pattern: alcohol and cocaine abuse. Those dark hours, however, give us the one affecting moment in Campbell's book, during which, with unknowing and ironic desperation, he snorts cocaine and reads his Bible with a kind of furious resolve to do better. Nowadays, Campbell is a sober Christian who tours, plays golf, and takes care of his family. His tone is tedious at times, particularly when he carps about the press, and the reader may long to know more about Buck Owens, Roy Clark, Bobbie Gentry, Roger Miller, and Merle Haggard than Campbell wishes to tell. A lot of good country people were moved by Campbell's recordings of Jimmy Webb songs such as "Wichita Lineman," however, and his book is a sure hit. <i>John Mort</i>Campbell's autobiography shows the pop and country/western singer, guitarist and composer making it to the top, sinking and rising again as he overcame troubles with alcohol, drugs and three marriages--and found religion. Writing with Carter, who also collaborated with Ronnie Milsap and Ralph Emery on their books, Campbell recalls the grinding poverty he underwent as one of 12 children of an Arkansas sharecropper, the career he established playing backup for Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross, and his joining the Beach Boys at the height of their popularity, all before he made it on his own. As interesting as Campbell's story is, his book is disappointing, for his fundamentalism turns him to sermonizing against abortion, the banning of school prayer and the liberal press.

He owned the beast now. Its flesh was his. Muscular magic in a compact four-legged frame, perfectly designed for running, stalking, and killing.</p><p> </p><p>He had taken on the name &#x201c;Jix&#x201d;&#x2014;one of the many Mayan words for &#x201c;jaguar&#x201d;&#x2014;due to his inclination toward great cats, and he furjacked one every chance he got. He preferred wild jaguars, living in the jungles of Mexico&#x2019;s Yucatan Peninsula&#x2014;creatures that hadn&#x2019;t lost their will to hunt.</p><p> </p><p>Reconnaissance was Jix&#x2019;s specialty: tracking and spying on Afterlights who His Excellency the King believed to be a threat. Afterlights such as the Eastern Witch&#x2014;the one they called Mary Hightower.</p><p> </p><p>His Excellency had created a barrier of wind upon the Mississippi River to keep her and other intruders out, but the Eastern Witch was shrewd and relentless. With the help of her own skinjackers, she had destroyed a living-world bridge, causing it to cross into Everlost. Then with a train full of followers and slaves, she rode a powerful locomotive across the river.</p><p> </p><p>At least that was the story.</p><p> </p><p>Others said that she never made the journey herself&#x2014;that something strange and mysterious happened to her, but no one could agree as to what it was. She flew off into the sky. She melted. She turned to stone. She turned to flesh. Each rumor was more outlandish than the last, and no one knew for sure if any of them were true.</p><p> </p><p>Jix was called in for closer surveillance. Discover their numbers, discover their intent, then report back to the king. If these trespassing Afterlights were truly a threat, they would be dealt with quickly, and would never see the light of day again. It all depended on Jix&#x2019;s report.</p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;You should skinjack the pilot of a flying machine,&#x201d; His Excellency had suggested to Jix, &#x201c;for speed in this matter would greatly please us.&#x201d;</p><p> </p><p>Jix, however, had resisted. &#x201c;But sir, my skill to stalk comes from the jaguar gods. If I make my journey impure, they will be angered, and take the skill away.&#x201d;</p><p> </p><p>His Excellency had then waved his hand dismissively. &#x201c;Do as you will&#x2014;as long as you bring us the results We require.&#x201d; The king always said &#x201c;us&#x201d; and &#x201c;we,&#x201d; even when there was no one else but him in the room.</p><p> </p><p>So, on a bright autumn day, Jix set out in the borrowed body of a jaguar, and within that speedy beast, he forged over mountains and rivers, resting when he had to, but never for long. When he came near human villages he heard many languages. Remnants of ancient tongues, Spanish, and finally English. Once he heard English, and saw signs written in that language, he knew he was getting close, yet never once was he spotted, for he had the best of both species now: the keen senses of the jaguar, and the full faculties of a human mind.</p><p> </p><p>The ghost train had crossed the bridge in Memphis, so this was his destination. He was certain to pick up a scent of the supernatural there, and track them down. As he drew nearer, he could feel the thrill of the hunt filling him.

The trip, celebrated in Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test ( LJ 8/68), has become part of the counterculture legend. These two copiously illustrated works commemorate the silver anniversary of that historic journey. Both cover the same key events and prominently feature Neal Cassady, but their approaches are very different. Perry and Babbs have compiled a montage of photos, reminiscences, interviews, and historical commentary that documents the change in consciousness that took place in the United States between 1964 and 1972. The book provides a thumbnail history of the development of LSD, a flavor of the short-lived but influential hippie movement, and a glimpse into some of the most creative lives of the time, including Allen Ginsberg, Larry McMurtry, and Jerry Garcia. Kesey's work is a surreal script in which Cassady's ghost is brought to trial. Witnesses testify to Cassady's deeds, re-creating the bus trip for the court. The script is clever and entertaining but it will only be fully appreciated by those knowledgeable about Cassady's life. Such background can be found in Carolyn Cassady's Off the Road ( LJ 6/15/90) and William Plummer's The Holy Goof ( LJ 10/15/81). Photographs are a major part of each book, but there is little overlap. The Smithsonian's recent attempts to acquire the bus may spark reader interest. Highly recommended.

His angular melodies and dissonant harmonies shook the jazz world to its foundations, ushering in the birth of "bebop" and establishing Monk as one of America's greatest composers. Yet throughout much of his life, his musical contribution took a backseat to tales of his reputed behavior. Writers tended to obsess over Monk's hats or his proclivity to dance on stage. To his fans, he was the ultimate hipster; to his detractors, he was temperamental, eccentric, taciturn, or childlike. But these labels tell us little about the man or his music.<p>In the first book on Thelonious Monk based on exclusive access to the Monk family papers and private recordings, as well as on a decade of prodigious research, prize-winning historian Robin D. G. Kelley brings to light a startlingly different Thelonious Monk -- witty, intelligent, generous, politically engaged, brutally honest, and a devoted father and husband. Indeed, <i>Thelonious Monk</i> is essentially a love story. It is a story of familial love, beginning with Monk's enslaved ancestors from whom Thelonious inherited an appreciation for community, freedom, and black traditions of sacred and secular song. It is about a doting mother who scrubbed floors to pay for piano lessons and encouraged her son to follow his dream. It is the story of romance, from Monk's initial heartbreaks to his lifelong commitment to his muse, the extraordinary Nellie Monk. And it is about his unique friendship with the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter, a scion of the famous Rothschild family whose relationship with Monk and other jazz musicians has long been the subject of speculation and rumor. Nellie, Nica, and various friends and family sustained Monk during the long periods of joblessness, bipolar episodes, incarceration, health crises, and other tragic and difficult moments.</p><p>Above all, <i>Thelonious Monk</i> is the gripping saga of an artist's struggle to "make it" without compromising his musical vision. It is a story that, like its subject, reflects the tidal ebbs and flows of American history in the twentieth century. Elegantly written and rich with humor and pathos, <i>Thelonious Monk</i> is the definitive work on modern jazz's most original composer.</p></p><p><b>Robin D.G. Kelley</b> is Professor of History and American Studies at the University of Southern California.&nbsp; He has written widely on American culture, politics, and African American history.&nbsp; His books include, <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i>, <i>Race Rebels: Culture, Politics, and the Black Working Class</i>,&nbsp; <i>Yo' Mama's DisFunktional!: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America</i>, and the forthcoming <i>Going Home: Jazz and the Making of Modern Africa</i>, to be published by Harvard University Press.ϻ�<p> <b>PRELUDE</b> <br> <br> </p><blockquote> <i>I have a choice here between writing about Monk as he is, or as he seems to be, and is generally thought to be. There isn't any great difficulty about it, because both sides are fertile ground; the stories merely differ in plausibility.</i><br> Critic Paul Bacon, 1949 </blockquote> <br> <br> <p> Benetta Smith -- known affectionately as "Teeny" -- loved to visit her Aunt Nellie and Uncle Thelonious. For a kid growing up in the late '50s and early '60s, the Monks' tiny ground-floor apartment at 243 West 63rd Street, must have seemed almost carnivalesque. Uncle Thelonious sat at the piano turning Christmas carols into Monk originals, or holding forth with a string of friendly put-downs or challenging questions about the ways of the world. Aunt Nellie chatted away, sometimes entertaining the kids with wild and wonderful stories, sometimes cursing booking agents, managers, and anyone else who took advantage of her dear husband, sometimes gently scolding one of her nieces not to "bang" on the piano. Their two children, "Toot" (Thelonious, Jr.) and "Boo Boo" (Barbara), added to the drama and the fun; they were full of energy, and their parents encouraged them to express themselves freely. The apartment and the neighborhood became a playground for Teeny's six siblings, as well as her cousins and their family friends. Uncle "Baby," Thelonious's younger brother Thomas, lived a couple of doors down, so his four children were always in the mix. </p><p> Like all his nieces and nephews, Teeny treated her uncle as an uncle -- not as some eccentric genius or celebrity. During one of her many visits in 1959 or '60, when she was about twelve years old, Teeny noticed a book of compositions by Chopin perched on her uncle's rented Steinway baby grand piano. Monk's piano was notorious for its clutter. It occupied a significant portion of the kitchen and extended into the front room. The lid remained closed, since it doubled as a temporary storage space for music, miscellaneous papers, magazines, folded laundry, dishes, and any number of stray kitchen items. </p><p> Teeny thumbed through the pages of the Chopin book, then turned to her uncle and asked, "What are you doing with that on the piano? I thought you couldn't read music? You can read that?" The challenge was on. In response, Monk sat down at the piano, turned to a very difficult piece, and started playing it at breakneck speed. </p><p> "His hands were a blur," she recalled decades later. "Then after he was through, he jumped up from the piano and just started grinning. So then I said, 'You didn't play that right.'" </p><p> "Whaaaa? What are you talking about? I played it ten times faster than anyone could!" </p><p> Teeny sassed back, "It is supposed to be played adagio and you played it allegro." </p><p> Monk loved that kind of one-upmanship, the playful banter, challenges from those who weren't afraid to engage him. And he was proud of his family, including Teeny's burgeoning knowledge of music. </p><p> For well over half a century, the press and the critics have portrayed Monk as "eccentric," "mad," "childlike," "brooding," "na�ve," "intuitive," "primitive," even "taciturn." As Nat Hentoff, one of the few critics who got to know Monk, observed: "Monk...became a stock cartoon figure for writers of Sunday-supplement pieces about the exotica of jazz. Pictures of Monk in dark glasses and goatee would usually be captioned 'Mad Monk' or 'The High Priest of Bop.' Exaggerated stories of his personal life were the 'substance' of the articles. There was no attempt to discuss the nature or seriousness of his musical intentions." Journalist Lewis Lapham's sympathetic portrait of Monk for the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> is typical of much of the writing about Monk. He described Thelonious as an "emotional and intuitive man, possessing a child's vision of the world, Monk talks, sleeps, eats, laughs, walks or dances as the spirit moves him." He was said to be uncommunicative, and music was the only way he could communicate. He supposedly lived in his own little world, exiled from reality, and had no interest in anything except his music and himself. The only music that interested him was his own, or the pop tunes and old standards that he transformed into his own idiom. </p><p> Even his fans and defenders made authoritative statements about Monk's lack of interest and/or knowledge of other musical genres -- especially classical music. In what was intended to be a genuine compliment, French critic Andr� Hodeir insisted that this "true jazzman" had no interest in "serious music." He assured his readers that "no twelve-tone sirens have lured Monk away from jazz. He probably doesn't even know that such music exists. I can safely say that the gradual development of his language has been the result of intuition and intuition alone." Pianist, critic, and educator John Mehegan said much the same thing in a 1963 essay. "The entire body of resources of Western man," he mused, "relating to the playing of the piano, which dates back to the sixteenth century, remains unknown to Thelonious Sphere Monk for the simple reason that Monk is not Western man. He is a Black man." Even fellow jazz pianist Bill Evans famously stated that Monk's "unique and astoundingly pure music" can be explained by his lack of "exposure to the Western classical music tradition or, for that matter, comprehensive exposure to any music other than jazz and American popular music." Quincy Jones extended the myth of pure genius to Monk's entire interaction with the world, as if he were a sealed fermentation vat: "He is not familiar with many classical works, or with much life outside himself, and I think because of this he did not create on a contrived or inhibited basis." </p><p> The myth is as attractive as it is absurd. The truth is, Thelonious Monk possessed an impressive knowledge of, and appreciation for, Western classical music, not to mention an encyclopedic knowledge of hymns and gospel music, American popular songs, and a variety of obscure art songs that defy easy categorization. For him, it was all music. Once in 1966, a phalanx of reporters in Helsinki pressed Monk about his thoughts on classical music and whether or not jazz and classical can come together. His drummer, Ben Riley, watched the conversation unfold: "Everyone wanted him to answer, give some type of definition between classical music and jazz...So he says, 'Two is one,' and that stopped the whole room. No one else said anything else." Two is one, indeed. Monk loved Fr�d�ric Chopin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Beethoven, and Bach, and like many of his peers of the bebop generation, he took an interest in Igor Stravinsky. And his life was no more monastic than any other urban jazzman's. Indeed, it was far more colorful and interesting than a true monk's. The myths surrounding Monk have gotten in the way of the truth, and the truth about his life and music is fascinating and complicated -- and no less original or creative than the myth. </p><p> Monk wasn't born with some kind of natural musical knowledge and ability, nor was he entirely self-taught (though he did have perfect pitch). He received a formidable music education and worked very hard to achieve his distinctive sound. Nor did he withdraw into an isolated musical meditation, away from the world. It took a village to raise Monk: a village populated by formal music teachers, local musicians from the San Juan Hill neighborhood of New York in which he grew up; an itinerant preacher, a range of friends and collaborators who helped facilitate his own musical studies and exploration; and a very large, extended family willing to pitch in and sacrifice a great deal so that Thelonious could pursue a life of uncompromising creativity. He drew inspiration, ideas, and lessons from family members, daily experience, joys and hardships, and the city itself -- its sounds, its colors, its drama. Hence this book is not just about him, or his music; rather, it is an intimate story about the folks who shaped him -- his hardworking and devoted mother, Barbara, his wife, Nellie, and her entire family, their children, his brother and sister and their kids, his musical kith and kin, his patron saint and friend the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter, his childhood friends and first crushes, the people of the local community center, his ancestors and the legacy they bestowed upon him; not to mention the agents, managers, producers, critics, judges, cops, attorneys, and others whose actions and decisions directly affected Monk's livelihood. </p><p> Thelonious Monk was very much of the world, at least until mental and physical illness finally caused him to withdraw, making his world seem much smaller, self-contained, and at times impenetrable. For most of his life he remained engaged and fascinated with his surroundings. Politics, art, commerce, nature, architecture, history were not beyond his ken, and Monk was the kind of man who loved a good debate, despite stories of his inability to communicate. Fortunately, many of his close friends and family members have been willing to share their stories, most of which have never been told before in print. They reveal a startlingly different Thelonious Monk -- witty, incredibly generous, intensely family-oriented, curious, critical, and brutally honest. In addition, Monk himself was frequently captured on tape telling stories, debating, or just shooting the breeze. The tapes were made by his friend and supporter the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter, the photographer W. Eugene Smith (at whose loft Monk's big band often rehearsed), or by his wife, Nellie. Such tapes are a biographer's dream, for they capture impromptu conversations and ideas unmediated by interviewers or media outlets. </p><p> One of those recordings, made by W. Eugene Smith during a big-band rehearsal in June of 1964, caught Monk in a funny conversation about the power of porpoises. Overhearing soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy talk about his friend, trombonist Roswell Rudd, getting a job at the Library of Congress working for Alan Lomax organizing recorded music from around the world, Monk's ear...</p></p><h2>A Short History Of Nearly Everything</h2><p>history of nearly everything</p><p>From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>One of the world's most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer. <br>In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world's most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything" is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>The Broom of the System</h2><p>The publication of his virtuoso novel Infinite Jest confirmed David Foster Wallace as "one of the big talents of his generation" <i> (The New York Times).</i> Readers who hunger for more will be richly satisfied by his first novel, <i>The Broom of the System,</i> a bracingly funny and fiercely original story.<p>The mysterious disappearance of her great-grandmother and twenty-five other elderly residents from a Shaker Heights nursing home has left Lenore Stonecipher Beadsman emotionally stranded on the edge of the Great Ohio Desert.

They're long and thin and splay toed, with buttons of yellow callus on the little toes and a thick stair-step of it on the back of the heel, and a few long black hairs are curling out of the skin at the tops of the feet, and the red nail polish is cracking and peeling in curls and candy-striped with decay. Lenore only notices because Mindy's bent over in the chair by the fridge picking at some of the polish on her toes; her bathrobe's opening a little, so there's some cleavage visible and everything, a lot more than Lenore's got, and the thick white towel wrapped around Mindy's wet washed shampooed head is coming undone and a wisp of dark shiny hair has slithered out of a crack in the folds and curled down all demurely past the side of Mindy's face and under her chin. It smells like Flex shampoo in the room, and also pot, since Clarice and Sue Shaw are smoking a big thick j-bird Lenore got from Ed Creamer back at Shaker School and brought up with some other stuff for Clarice, here at school.</p><p>What's going on is that Lenore Beadsman, who's fifteen, has just come all the way from home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, right near Cleveland, to visit her big sister, Clarice Beadsman, who's a fresh man at this women's college, called Mount Holyoke; and Lenore's staying with her sleeping bag in this room on the second floor of Rumpus Hall that Clarice shares with her roommates, Mindy Metal man and Sue Shaw. Lenore's also come to sort of check out this college, a little bit. This is because even though she's just fifteen she's supposedly quite intelligent and thus acceleratedand already a junior at Shaker School and thus thinking about college, application-wise, for next year. So she's visiting. Right now it's a Friday night in March.</p><p>Sue Shaw, who's not nearly as pretty as Mindy or Clarice, is bringing the joint over here to Mindy and Lenore, and Mindy takes it and lets her toe alone for a second and sucks the bird really hard, so it glows bright and a seed snaps loudly and bits of paper ash go flying and floating, which Clarice and Sue find super funny and start laughing at really hard, whooping and clutching at each other, and Mindy breathes it in really deep and holds it in and passes the bird to Lenore, but Lenore says no thank you.</p><p>"No thank you," says Lenore.</p><p>"Go ahead, you brought it, why not . . . ," croaks Mindy Metal man, talking the way people talk without breathing, holding on to the smoke.</p><p>"I know, but it's track season at school and I'm on the team and I don't smoke during the season, I can't, it kills me," Lenore says.</p><p>So Mindy shrugs and finally lets out a big breath of pale used-up smoke and coughs a deep little cough and gets up with the bird and takes it over across the room to Clarice and Sue Shaw, who are by a big wooden stereo speaker listening to this song, again, by Cat Stevens, for like the tenth time tonight. Mindy's robe's more or less open, now, and Lenore can see some pretty amazing stuff, but Mindy just walks across the room. Lenore can at this point divide all the girls she's known neatly into girls who think deep down they're pretty and girls who deep down think they're really not. Girls who think they're pretty don't care much about their bathrobes being undone and are good at makeup and like to walk when people are watching, and they act different when there are boys around; and girls like Lenore, who don't think they're too pretty, tend not to wear makeup, and run track, and wear black Converse sneakers, and keep their bathrobes pretty well fastened at all times. Mindy sure is pretty, though, except for her feet.</p><p>The Cat Stevens song is over again, and the needle goes up by itself, and obviously none of these three feel like moving all the way to start it again, so they're just sitting back in their hard wood desk chairs, Mindy in her faded pink terry robe with one shiny smooth leg all bare and sticking out; Clarice in her Desert boots and her dark blue jeans that Lenore calls her shoe-horn jeans, and that white western shirt she'd wore at the state fair the time she'd had her purse stolen, and her blond hair flooding all over the shirt, and her eyes very blue right now; Sue Shaw with her red hair and a green sweater and green tartan skirt and fat white legs with a bright red pimple just over one knee, legs crossed with one foot jiggling one of those boat shoes, with the sick white soles--Lenore dislikes that kind of shoe a lot.Clarice after a quiet bit lets out a long sigh and says, in whispers, "Cat . . . is . . . God," giggling a little at the end. The other two giggle too.</p><p>"God? How can Cat be God? Cat exists." Mindy's eyes are all red.</p><p>"That's offensive and completely blasphemous," says Sue Shaw, eyes wide and puffed and indignant.</p><p>"Blasphemous?" Clarice dies, looks at Lenore. "Blasphemous," she says. Her eyes aren't all that bad, really, just unusually cheerful, as if she's got a joke she's not telling.</p><p>"Blissphemous," says Mindy.<br>"Blossphemous. "<br>"Blousephemous. "<br>"Bluesphemous. "<br>"Boisterous. "<br>"Boisteronahalfshell. "<br>"Bucephalus. "<br>"Bamey Rubble."<br>"Baba Yaga."<br>"Bolshevik. "<br>"Blaphemous!"</p><p>They're dying, doubled over, and Lenore's laughing that weird sympathetic laugh you laugh when everybody else is laughing so hard they make you laugh too. The noise of the big party downstairs is coming through the floor and vibrating in Lenore's black sneakers and the arms of the chair. Now Mindy slides out of her desk chair all limp and shlomps down on Lenore's sleeping bag on the floor next to Clarice's pretend-Persian ruglet from Mooradian's in Cleveland, and Mindy modestly covers her crotch with a comer of her robe, but Lenore still can't help but see the way her breasts swell up into the worn pink towel cloth of the robe, all full and stuff, even lying down on her back, there, on the floor. Lenore unconsciously looks down a little at her own chest, under her flannel shirt.</p><p>"Hunger," Sue Shaw says after a minute. "Massive, immense, uncontrollable, consuming, uncontrollable, hunger."</p><p>"This is so," says Mindy.</p><p>"We will wait"--Clarice looks at her watch on the underside of her wrist--"one, that is one hour, before eating anything what soentirelyever."</p><p>"No we can't possibly possibly do that."</p><p>"But do it we shall. As per room discussions of not one week ago, when we explicitly agreed that we shall not gorge when utterly flapped, lest we get fat and repulsive, like Mindy, over there, you poor midge."</p><p>"Fart-blossom," Mindy says absently, she's not fat and she knows it, Lenore knows it, they all know it.</p><p>"A lady at all times, that Metalman," Clarice says. Then a minute, "Speaking of which, you might just maybe either fix your robe or get dressed or get up off your back in Lenore's stuff, I'm not really all up for giving you a gynecological exam, which is sort of what you're making us do, here, O Lesbia of Thebes."</p><p>"Stuff and bother," says Mindy, or rather, "Stuth and bozzer"; and she gets up swaying and reaching for solid things, goes over to the door that goes into her little single bedroom off the bathroom. She got there first in September and took it, Clarice had said in a letter, this Playboy-Playmatish JAP from Scarsdale, and she's shedding what's left of her bathrobe, battered into submission, leaving it all wet in Lenore's lap in the chair by the door, and going through the door with her long legs, deliberate steps. Shuts the door.</p></p><h2>The Adventures of a South Pole Pig: A Novel of Snow and Courage</h2><p><p>Flora the pig was born for adventure: &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s unexplored and needs to get dug up, call me.

Probably his most famous stories are those of `Father Brown&#39;, but he wrote much about every conceivable subject under or beyond the sun. The best accounts of his life are to be found in his own Autobiography, published soon after his death in 1936, and in Miss Maisie Ward&#39;s Life of him.

Zorba, a Greek working man, is a larger-than-life character, energetic and unpredictable. He accompanies the unnamed narrator to Crete to work in the narrator&#x2019;s lignite mine, and the pair develops a singular relationship. The two men couldn&#x2019;t be further apart: The narrator is cerebral, modest, and reserved; Zorba is unfettered, spirited, and beyond the reins of civility. Over the course of their journey, he becomes the narrator&#x2019;s greatest friend and inspiration and helps him to appreciate the joy of living.<br><br> Zorba has been acclaimed as one of the most remarkable figures in literature; he is a character in the great tradition of Sinbad the Sailor, Falstaff, and Sancho Panza. He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he&#x2019;s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love. <i>Zorba the Greek</i> explores the beauty and pain of existence, inviting readers to reevaluate the most important aspects of their lives and live to the fullest.</p><p>Nikos Kazantzakis was born in Crete in 1883. He studied literature and art in Germany and Italy, philosophy under Henri Bergson in Paris and received his law degree from the University of Athens. The Greek Minster of Education in 1945, Kazantzakis was also a dramatist, translator, poet, and travel writer. Among his most famous works are, <i>The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, The Last Temptation of Christ,</i> and <i>Saviors of God</i>.&nbsp; He died in October 1957.Zorba the Greek PROLOGUE<p></p> <br><br> <br>I often wished to write &#x201c;The Saint&#x2019;s Life of Alexis Zorba,&#x201d; a laborer of advanced age whom I exceedingly loved.<br> <br>The great benefactors in my life have been journeys and dreams. Very few people, dead or alive, have helped me in my struggles; yet if I wished to single out those individuals who did engrave their traces most deeply upon my soul, I would presumably designate these four: Homer, Bergson, Nietzsche, and Zorba.<br> <br>The first was a serene, all-bright eye for me like the sun&#x2019;s disk, illuminating everything with redemptive brightness. Bergson released me from insoluble philosophical anguishes that had tormented my early youth. Nietzsche enriched me with new anguishes and showed me how to transform misfortune, sorrow, and uncertainty into pride. Zorba taught me to love life and not to fear death.<br> <br>If today I were to choose a spiritual guide from the whole wide world&#x2014;a &#x201c;guru,&#x201d; as they say in India, a &#x201c;venerable father&#x201d; as the monks say at Mount Athos&#x2014;the one I would choose without fail would be Zorba. He possessed precisely what a pen pusher needs for deliverance: the primitive glance that snatches nourishment lovingly from on high; the creative artlessness, renewed at each daybreak, that views everything unceasingly as though for the first time, bequeathing virginity to the everlastingly quotidian elements of wind, sea, fire, women, and bread; the sureness of hand, the freshness of heart, the gallant stalwart&#x2019;s ability to poke fun at his own soul for seeming to harbor a power higher than the soul; finally, that wild, throaty laugh welling up from a source deeper than a man&#x2019;s inner depths, a laugh that erupted redemptively at crucial moments from Zorba&#x2019;s elderly chest, exploding with sufficient power to demolish (and did demolish) all the barricades&#x2014;morality, religion, nationalism&#x2014;erected around themselves by wretched, lily-livered humans to let them hobble securely through their diminished mini-lives.<br> <br>I can hardly endure my rage and sorrow when I consider what nourishment my famished soul was fed by books and teachers for so many years, and then compare this to the leonine brainpower that Zorba fed me for just a few months. My life was fated to be ruined because I encountered this &#x201c;venerable father&#x201d; too late, when the portion of my inner self still capable of being saved was minimal. The great alteration&#x2014;the definitive change of front, the &#x201c;conflagration&#x201d; and &#x201c;renewal&#x201d;&#x2014;did not take place. The time was already too late. Thus Zorba, instead of becoming an exalted, authoritative model for my life, was sadly debased into a literary subject causing me to fill numerous sheets of paper with splotches!<br> <br>The doleful privilege of turning life into art leads many flesh-eating souls to disaster because ardent passion departs the breast when it finds an outlet of this sort. In such a case the soul experiences relief. It no longer fumes with rage, no longer needs to fight breast to breast, to intervene directly in life or action. Instead, it is pleased to admire its ardent passion as it ascends like smoke rings in the breeze and fades away. The soul not only takes pleasure in this relief; it also grows proud, for it believes that it is accomplishing something grand by supposedly eternalizing the irreplaceable temporary moment, which alone possesses flesh and blood in limitless time. This is how Zorba, so full of flesh and bone, degenerated in my hands into paper and ink. Years ago, the Zorba story, without my wishing it to do so, and, indeed, wishing the opposite, began to crystallize within me. The mystic rites began deep inside me, a musical turbulence at first, a feverish delight and malaise, as though my organism, a foreign body having entered the bloodstream, were struggling to control and annihilate this story through assimilation. Words then began to speed around the nucleus, to encircle and nourish it like an embryo. Blurry memories became clear, sunken joys and sorrows rose to the surface, life was transposed into finer air&#x2014;and Zorba became a tall tale.<br> <br>I still lacked a clear notion of what form to give this tall Zorbatic tale: novel, poem, complex make-believe narrative from the Thousand and One Nights, or something matter-of-fact, dry, reproducing the conversations we had on the Cretan shoreline where we lived and were supposedly digging to find lignite. Both of us well knew that this practical purpose was just a smokescreen for the eyes of outside observers. Neither of us could wait for the sun to set, the workmen to leave, the two of us to stretch out on the sand, eat our delicious village food, drink our dry Cretan wine, and begin to talk.<br> <br>Most of the time I said nothing. What could an intellectual say to an ogre? I would listen to him speak about his village near Mount Olympus, about snow, wolves, terrorists during the Balkan Wars, Hagia Sophia, lignite, magnesite, women, God, patriotism, death. Then, suddenly, when he was choking and no longer able to find room for words, he would leap up onto the beach&#x2019;s rough shingle and start to dance.<br> <br>An old man, erect and bony, his head thrown back, his fully round eyes as tiny as a bird&#x2019;s, he would dance and shriek, stamping his callused soles on the shoreline, his face spattered with seawater.<br> <br>If I had listened to his voice&#x2014;not his voice, his outcry&#x2014;my life would have become worthwhile. I would have experienced with blood, flesh, and bone what I now ponder like a hashish smoker and effectuate with paper and ink.<br> <br>But I did not dare. I would see Zorba dancing at midnight with horse-like whinnies, bellowing at me to slip out of my comfortable shell of prudent habit and to flee with him on great journeys. But I remained motionless, shuddering.<br> <br>Many times in my life I have been ashamed because I caught my soul not daring to do what supreme folly&#x2014;life&#x2019;s essence&#x2014;was calling me to do. But never did I feel so ashamed of my soul as I did when in the presence of Zorba.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>One morning we parted at daybreak. I headed abroad once again, suffering from the incurable Faustian disease of learning. He went north and settled near Skopia, in Serbia, where he apparently unearthed a rich vein of magnesite in a mountainside. He hooked a few investors, purchased tools, recruited workmen, and began once again to open up galleries in the earth. He dynamited boulders, constructed roads, brought water, built a house, and married&#x2014;the lusty old codger!&#x2014;married Lyuba, a frisky, good-looking widow, fathering a child with her.<br> <br>One day when I was in Berlin I received a telegram: &#x201c;FOUND MOST BEAUTIFUL GREEN STONE. COME IMMEDIATELY. ZORBA.&#x201d;<br> <br>Germany was then suffering from intense famine. The Papiermark had fallen so low that you carried sackfuls with millions in them to make a small purchase, and when you went to a restaurant to eat you opened your napkin, which was overfilled with paper currency, and emptied it onto the table in order to pay. The day came when ten billion Papiermarks were required for a postage stamp.<br> <br>Hunger, cold, frayed jackets, tattered shoe soles, red German cheeks turned yellow. An autumn wind blew, and people fell in the streets like leaves. Infants were given a bit of rubber to gnaw as a ruse so they wouldn&#x2019;t cry. Police patrolled the bridges over the river to prevent mothers from jumping in at night to save themselves by drowning.<br> <br>It was winter, snowing. A German professor of Chinese in the room next to mine, in order to keep warm, clasped his long brush and attempted to copy some ancient Chinese poem or a Confucian maxim using the incommodious method of the Far East, by which the tip of the brush, the scholar&#x2019;s delicately elevated elbow, and his heart were required to form a triangle. &#x201c;After a few moments,&#x201d; he used to tell me with pleasure, &#x201c;sweat runs from my armpits and thus I feel warm.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was during those bitter-cold days that I received Zorba&#x2019;s telegram. At first I was annoyed. Millions of people were humiliated and forced to their knees because they lacked a slice of bread to support their spirits and bones, and here comes a telegram telling me to travel a thousand miles to go see a beautiful green stone! &#x201c;Curses on beauty!&#x201d; I said to myself. &#x201c;It is heartless, unable to sympathize with human suffering.&#x201d; But suddenly I was frightened. My annoyance had already dissipated. I felt with horror that Zorba&#x2019;s inhumane outcry was answering another inhumane outcry within myself. A savage vulture in me spread its wings, ready for departure.<br> <br>But I did not depart. Once again, I did not dare. I did not board a train, did not obey the divinely ferocious internal outcry, did not perform a gallant, irrational deed. Following the sensible, frigid, human voice of reason, I took up my pen, wrote to Zorba, and explained.<br> <br>He answered me: &#x201c;Forgive me for saying this, Boss, but you are a pen pusher. You poor creep, you had the chance of a lifetime to see a beautiful green stone, and you didn&#x2019;t see it. By God, sometimes when I have no work to do, I sit down and ask myself, &#x2018;Is there a hell or isn&#x2019;t there?&#x2019; But yesterday, when I received your letter, I said to myself, &#x2018;There sure is a hell for certain pen pushers!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Memories have begun to flow. They are jostling each other, hurrying. The time has come to put things in order, to start &#x201c;The Saint&#x2019;s Life of Alexis Zorba&#x201d; from the beginning. Even the most insignificant events related to him gleam clearly, preciously, in my mind at this moment, darting swiftly like multicolored fish in summer&#x2019;s diaphanous seawater. Nothing of his has been lost to me; everything Zorba touched seems to have become immortal. Yet these days I am suddenly worried. It has been two years since I received a letter from him. He is more than seventy years old; he may be in danger. Yes, he most certainly must be in danger; otherwise I cannot explain why I am governed by an abrupt need to reassemble whatever was his: to remember what he said to me and what he did, immobilizing everything on paper to prevent its disappearance&#x2014;as though I wished to exorcise death, his death. I fear that what I am writing is not a book; it is a memorial.<br> <br>Looking at it now, I realize that it contains all the characteristics of a memorial. The tray with its boiled wheat, the kollyva, is embellished with a thick sprinkling of sugar and the name &#x201c;ALEXIS ZORBA&#x201d; written on top with cinnamon and almonds. I look at this name and all at once the indigo-blue sea of Crete rises up, flooding my mind. Words, laughter, dancing, carousing, concerns, muted conversations at twilight, full, round eyes focused upon me forever with tender disdain as though welcoming me at every moment and also bidding me farewell at every moment.<br> <br>Just as, when we view a decorated memorial tray, disparate memories hang like bunched-up bats in the cave of our heart, so Zorba&#x2019;s ghost, without my desiring this, was complicated from the very start by another much-loved shade, Stassinakis, and behind it unexpectedly by still another, that of a fallen woman, Madame Hortense, kissed a thousand times, her hair dyed a thousand times, whom Zorba and I had met on a sandy Cretan beach by the Libyan Sea.<br> <br>The human heart must surely be a grave that is closed and filled with blood. If it opens, all the inconsolable specters that continually multiply around us, darkening the air, run to it in order to drink, quench their thirst, and return to life. They run to drink our heart blood, knowing that no other resurrection exists.<br> <br>In front of all the rest of them today runs Zorba with gigantic strides, pushing aside the other specters because he knows that the memorial taking place on this day is his own.<br> <br>Let us therefore grant him our blood so that he may be revived.<br> <br>Let us do our best to allow this amazing guzzler, swiller, workhorse, womanizer, and scalawag to remain alive just a little longer&#x2014;the broadest soul, surest body,<br> <br>freest outcry that I ever knew.</p><h2>Fiend Folio (Dungeons &amp; Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)</h2><p><b>Vanquish Terrible Evil</b><br><br>The noblest heroes must contend with the foulest monsters.

His vision is bold, but strikingly unpretentious: many of the dishes in <i>A Great American Cook</i>&#x2014;like the Shrimp BLT, Crispy Chicken and Goat Cheese Burritos, and Gingerbread with Brandied Plums&#x2014;are free-spirited plays on classics, and his &#x201c;less is more&#x201d; philosophy animates suppers like flash-seared scallops on caramelized onions and chicken cooked under a brick with a sauce of ros� wine, bacon, and peas. From a versatile vegetable dish that goes with nearly every main course to handmade pastas with delicate sauces to a foolproof way to cook salmon, Waxman gives you all the techniques and recipes you need for simple, sophisticated cooking at home.</p></p><p>Can a great chef's cookbook feel loose, almost laid-back? It can if its author is Jonathan Waxman, a "founding chef" at Alice Water's Chez Panisse and proprietor of Jams and Barbuto in Manhattan. His <i>A Great American Cook</i>--a collection of 100-plus recipes for the likes of Sea Scallop Fettuccine, Pork Shoulder with Mole Sauce, and Curried Catfish with Apple-Corn Fritters--shows a master in top form, blending global cooking traditions to produce uniquely American food, homey yet refined. His dishes are accessible to all cooks willing to cull the necessary (sometimes pricey) ingredients and spend a bit of time in the kitchen. <p> Following an idiosyncratic take on ingredients and techniques (on bacon: "OK--I love bacon--and yeah, I'm from a Jewish household") the book explores, in addition to the usual course stops, sandwiches like Shrimp BLT and pizzas, as well as desserts, including Angel Food Cake with Toffee Crunch and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Tart. Of top interest are Waxman's grilling how-to's and other technical insights (for example, to dress a salad properly, add the vinegar first). Seafood, and salmon in particular, receives expert attention. Here is one man's soul cooking of a high yet relaxed order that readers will happily embrace. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>No Bio</p><h2>Breakout Churches: Discover How To Make The Leap</h2><p><p>Breakout Churches Can Your Church Become One?

Their missions were dangerous and never-ending. One bombardier in the wing was a young New Yorker named Joseph Heller, who would later turn his experience into the classic 1961 war novel <i>Catch-22</i>. Now aviation historian Thomas McKelvey Cleaver takes a closer look at the real-life men of the 57th, whose camaraderie in the face of death inspired the raucous cast of heroes and antiheros in <i>Catch-22</i>.</p><p><br><br><b>The true story behind <i>Catch-22</i></b><br><br>Joseph Heller&#x2019;s classic novel turns on the impossible dilemma that trapped the World War II aviators flying bombing missions over Europe: Anyone would be crazy to keep defying enemy guns and deadly flak day after day. But if you asked to be grounded you were obviously sane, and so you had to keep flying. Thus Joseph Heller and his fellow aviators were forced to pile suicide mission on top of suicide mission as the number of total required flights was continually upped, and the promised release back home receded perpetually into the future. <br><br>Now, veteran aviation historian Thomas McKelvey Cleaver exposes the true story behind the iconic novel, digging into contemporary letters, war diaries, and other hitherto-unseen primary sources from the unit Joseph Heller himself flew with. In his fresh research, Cleaver uncovered the gripping stories of young men who daily challenged death in their fragile flying machines and the missing explanation of how Heller himself escaped from the nightmare that his fellow airmen remained mired in. <i>The Bridgebusters </i> reveals:<br><br> How an entire crew that had racked up 70 missions and been awarded the promised orders to return home was forced to fly one last time to their deaths<br> The many ways to die in the air: flak hits, fuel fires, faulty parachutes, mangled landing gear<br> How shot-down aviators managed to survive in hostile territory<br> How one courageous pilot handled orders to drop his bombs on friendly Italian civilians<br> Why "road block" missions were so hated by the crews of the Mitchell Bombers<br> Why Joseph Heller was sent home with a total of only 60 missions under his belt when the required number was 70<br> Why Heller was "the angriest guy I ever knew," according to a screenwriter who collaborated with him on the Catch-22 movie<br><br>Cleaver&#x2019;s electrifying account of the daring exploits of American aircrews and the moral dilemmas they faced is not to be missed.<br>Thomas McKelvey Cleaver, screenwriter and military historian, is a contributing editor of <i>Flight Journal</i> and the author of <i>Aces of the 78th Fighter Group, Air Combat Annals,</i> and <i>Fabled Fifteen: The Pacific War Saga of Carrier Air Group 15</i>.

In a unique way, the art and architecture of Aztec, Inca and Guaran� civilizations blended with those of Europe, North Africa and the Far East. In particular, the Spanish and Portuguese empires in Central and South America created the climate for a flourishing, diverse and distinct version of Renaissance and Baroque culture, produced under utterly different social and geographic conditions from those found in Europe. The products of this unique culture include some of the most lavish and visually arresting works of art and architecture in the world.<br> In this lively overview of the tremendously rich and varied artistic output of the area from southern Chile to northern California, Gauvin Alexander Bailey discusses viceregal and missionary as well as civic and rural architecture, alongside religious and secular painting, sculpture, metalwork, textiles and ceramics. But he also looks back to pre-colonial influences and concludes with an examination of how twentieth-century artists such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo interpreted their artistic heritage. Even today, the art of the colonial period remains at the centre of Latin American society, culture and identity. The result is a book that provides a new and comprehensive understanding of all the influences that led to one of the most cosmopolitan artistic outpourings in the whole history of art.</p><p>Gauvin Alexander Bailey is Associate Professor of Art History at Clark University, Massachusetts."Wide-ranging and handsomely illustrated...

In an effort to know one of her favorite writers better. Janet Malcolm -- who has brought light to the dark and complicated corners of psychoanalysis and has exposed the treacheries inherent within journalism--traveled to Russia and the places where Chekhov lived and worked. Out of her encounters with modern-day Russians she builds bridges backward in time to Chekhov and to the characters and ideas in his unexampled short stories and plays. The chapters are like pools of thought that coalesce into a profound, unified vision of one of Western literary culture's most important figures. For example, Chekhov's self-effacement prompts a consideration of his characters' odd un-pin-down-ability and then a discussion of limitations in writing biography.<br><br>One need not know Chekhov's writing to enjoy and be enlightened by <b>Reading Chekhov</b> (though anyone who does will find it doubly edifying). It is a work in which as we watch one outstanding mind try to understand another, we learn more about ourselves--our own ways of reading, thinking, and behaving: generally, what it means to be human.</p><p>&#x201c;One of the most gratifying things about <i>Reading Chekhov</i> is its quiet, vigorous defense of the prerogatives of criticism against the imperial banality of biography.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;[A] thoughtful and sensitive study . . .

No telling what might happen."<br>-- Michael Dirda, The Washington Post Book World<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Thomas Perry is the author of many critically acclaimed novels, including the Edgar Award-winning The Butcher&#39;s Boy and the national bestsellers Death Benefits and Pursuit.Since his Edgar-winning debut with Butcher's Boy (1982), Perry has inked a series of bold seriocomic thrillers (Metzger's Dog, Big Fish, Island) with ever more guffaws than grit. Here, though, he resurrects the anonymous hit-man hero of Butcher's Boy and sends him on a brawny, bloody vendetta whose rare humor is determinedly dark, even dour. In the decade since he fled to England after killing 20 mobsters in revenge for a double-cross, the ``Butcher's Boy'' has been living a life of cautious ease. One day at the races, though, he's spotted by a young American mafiosi who decides to bag the still-hunted assassin--leading to the would-be capo's instant death and soon to a pitch-black comedy of errors as the killer flies to America to settle with the mobsters he thinks are hot on his trail. A virtual juggernaut of vengeance, he lands in New York, buys a gun, and kills the young mafiosi's boss. He then jets to L.A., where, deplaning, he spots a gunman he assumes is another mafiosi- -and so he zooms on to Santa Fe and kills the head of the West Coast mob. The Butcher Boy then flies to Buffalo to buy a new I.D. but is spotted by yet another mobster, resulting in further carnage. All this gore-giddy mayhem is tethered by rich details of hit-man procedure and by flashbacks of the Butcher Boy's apprentice days, and is spun into unexpected twists by one big plot joke: The man in L.A. was not a mobster but a federal agent put on the killer's tail by his old nemesis, Justice Dept. star Elizabeth Waring. When the Butcher Boy realizes this, he decides to kill Waring--leading to lots more deaths and a tense climax that promises yet another sequel. Tough and energetic, but suffering from a moral black hole at the center: the Butcher Boy himself, a finally unsympathetic antihero whose nonstop killing makes him little more than a thinking person's Terminator. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

MacDonald&#39;s Travis McGee novels. We were giving him a brand-new, beautiful look; ingeniously, we used a deep blue color for THE DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY, a gold color for A DEADLY SHADE OF GOLD, a lavender hue for THE LONG LAVENDER LOOK, etc. But as I worked on the actual stories themselves, I realized that as colorful as these books now are on the outside, they&#39;re even more colorful on the inside. In order to prepare these books, we had to have them retyped from scratch; some of these books are so old that the plates had died, so we had nothing to print from. So all the books had to be proofread as if they were new books, and what a joy it was working on them. I unexpectedly rediscovered an author and character I knew very little about. Travis McGee is one of the great characters in crime fiction, and John D. MacDonald a fascinating storyteller. You never know what either is going to do next, or say next; what is going on in their minds is as important, if not more so, then what is going on outside Travis&#39;s boat.

The sole survivor of that mission, a priest named Emilio Sandoz, returned a beaten and broken man, having suffered rape and mutilation at the hands of enigmatic aliens. Now the Jesuits want to go back to Rakhat, and they want Sandoz aboard the new mission. But Sandoz has renounced his priesthood and even found a measure of happiness with his new wife and stepdaughter. Meanwhile, on Rakhat, contact with the humans has thrown the local culture into turmoil, precipitating a war between Rakhat's two sentient races. As forces conspire to send Emilio back to Rakhat--and toward a possible reconciliation with God--the planet verges on genocidal destruction. <i>Children of God</i> is a more polished novel than <i>The Sparrow</i>, and the story is equally compelling.Praise for The Sparrow<br><br>"A startling, engrossing and moral work of fiction."<br>--Colleen McCullough, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"The Sparrow tackles a difficult subject with grace and intelligence."<br>--Alix Madrigal, San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Important novels leave deep cracks in our beliefs, our prejudices, and our blinders.

In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected Siberia or translating his research into bestselling publications that changed science and thinking. Among Humboldt&#x2019;s most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone. <br><br> Now Andrea Wulf brings the man and his achievements back into focus: his daring expeditions and investigation of wild environments around the world and his discoveries of similarities between climate and vegetation zones on different continents. She also discusses his prediction of human-induced climate change, his remarkable ability to fashion poetic narrative out of scientific observation, and his relationships with iconic figures such as Sim�n Bol�var and Thomas Jefferson. Wulf examines how Humboldt&#x2019;s writings inspired other naturalists and poets such as Darwin, Wordsworth, and Goethe, and she makes the compelling case that it was Humboldt&#x2019;s influence that led John Muir to his ideas of natural preservation and that shaped Thoreau&#x2019;s <i>Walden</i>.<br><br> With this brilliantly researched and compellingly written book, Andrea Wulf shows the myriad fundamental ways in which Humboldt created our understanding of the natural world, and she champions a renewed interest in this vital and lost player in environmental history and science.</p><p><b>ANDREA WULF</b>&nbsp;was born in India and moved to Germany as a child.

He still intended to travel to Lima, even though Captain Baudin wouldn&#x2019;t be there. From Lima Humboldt hoped to find passage to Mexico, which he also wanted to explore. First, though, he was going to climb Chimborazo &#x2013; the crown of his obsession. This majestic inactive volcano &#x2013; a &#x2018;monstrous colossus&#x2019; as Humboldt described it &#x2013; was about one hundred miles to the south-west of Quito and rose to almost 21,000 feet.[7]7&nbsp; <br><br>As Humboldt, Bonpland, Mont�far and Jos� rode towards the volcano, they passed thick tropical vegetation. In the valleys they admired daturas with their large trumpet-shaped orange blossoms and bright red fuchsias with their almost unreal-looking sculptural petals. Then, as the men slowly ascended, these voluptuous blooms were replaced by open grass plains where herds of small llama-like vicu�as grazed. Then Chimborazo appeared on the horizon, standing alone on a high plateau, like a majestic dome. For several days as they approached, the mountain stood out against the vibrant blue of the sky with no cloud smudging its imposing outline. Whenever they stopped, an excited Humboldt took out his telescope. He saw a blanket of snow on the slopes and the landscape around Chimborazo appeared barren and desolate. Thousands of boulders and rocks covered the ground, as far as he could see. It was an otherworldly scenery. By now Humboldt had climbed so many volcanoes that he was the most experienced mountaineer in the world but Chimborazo was a daunting prospect even to him. But what appeared unreachable, Humboldt later explained, &#x2018;exerts a mysterious pull&#x2019;. <br><br>On 22 June they arrived at the foot of the volcano where they spent a fitful night in a small village. Early the next morning, Humboldt&#x2019;s team began the ascent together with a group of local porters. They crossed the grassy plains and slopes on mules until they reached an altitude of 13,500 feet. As the rocks became steeper, they left the animals behind and continued on foot. The weather was turning against them. It had snowed during the night and the air was cold. Unlike the previous days, the summit of Chimborazo was shrouded in fog. Once in a while the fog lifted, granting them a brief yet tantalizing glimpse of the peak. It would be a long day.<br><br>At 15,600 feet their porters refused to go on. Humboldt, Bonpland, Mont�far and Jos� divided the instruments between them and continued on their own. The fog held Chimborazo&#x2019;s summit in its embrace. Soon they were crawling on all fours along a high ridge that narrowed to a dangerous two inches with steep cliffs falling away to their left and right &#x2013; fittingly the Spanish called this ridge the <i>cuchilla</i>, or &#x2018;knife edge&#x2019;. Humboldt looked determinedly ahead. It didn&#x2019;t help that the cold had numbed their hands and feet, nor that the foot that he had injured during a previous climb had become infected. Every step was leaden at this height. Nauseous and dizzy with altitude sickness, their eyes bloodshot and their gums bleeding, they suffered from a constant vertigo which, Humboldt later admitted, &#x2018;was very dangerous, given the situation we were in&#x2019;. On Pichincha Humboldt&#x2019;s altitude sickness had been so severe that he had fainted. Here on the <i>cuchilla</i>, it could be fatal.<br><br>Despite these difficulties, Humboldt still had the energy to set up his instruments every few hundred feet as they ascended. The icy wind had chilled the brass instruments and handling the delicate screws and levers with half-frozen hands was almost impossible. He plunged his thermometer into the ground, read the barometer and collected air samples to analyse its chemical components. He measured humidity and tested the boiling point of water at different altitudes. They also kicked boulders down the precipitous slopes to test how far they would roll.<br><br>After an hour of treacherous climbing, the ridge became a little less steep but now sharp rocks tore their shoes and their feet began to bleed. Then, suddenly, the fog lifted, revealing Chimborazo&#x2019;s white peak glinting in the sun, a little over 1,000 feet above them &#x2013; but they also saw that their narrow ridge had ended. Instead, they were confronted by the mouth of a huge crevasse which opened in front of them. To get around it would have involved walking across a field of deep snow but by now it was 1 p.m. and the sun had melted the icy crust that covered the snow. When Mont�far gingerly tried to tread on it, he sank so deeply that he completely disappeared. There was no way to cross. As they paused, Humboldt took out the barometer again and measured their altitude at 19,413 feet. Though they wouldn&#x2019;t make it to the summit, it still felt like being on the top of the world. No one had ever come this high &#x2013; not even the early balloonists.<br><br>Looking down Chimborazo&#x2019;s slopes and the mountain ranges in the distance, everything that Humboldt had seen in the previous years came together. His brother Wilhelm had long believed that Alexander&#x2019;s mind was made &#x2018;to connect ideas, to detect chains of things&#x2019;. As he stood that day on Chimborazo, Humboldt absorbed what lay in front of him while his mind reached back to all the plants, rock formations and measurements that he had seen and taken on the slopes of the Alps, the Pyrenees and in Tenerife. Everything that he had ever observed fell into place. Nature, Humboldt realized, was a web of life and a global force. He was, a colleague later said, the first to understand that everything was interwoven as with &#x2018;a thousand threads&#x2019;. This new idea of nature was to change the way people understood the world.<br><br>Humboldt was struck by this &#x2018;resemblance which we trace in climates the most distant from each other&#x2019;. Here in the Andes, for example, grew a moss that reminded him of a species from the forests in northern Germany, thousands of miles away. On the mountains near Caracas he had examined rhododendron-like plants &#x2013; alpine rose trees, as he called them &#x2013; which were like those from the Swiss Alps. Later, in Mexico, he would find pines, cypresses and oaks that were similar to those that grew in Canada. Alpine plants could be found on the mountains of Switzerland, in Lapland and here in the Andes. Everything was connected.<br><br>For Humboldt, the days they had spent travelling from Quito and then climbing up Chimborazo had been like a botanical journey that moved from the Equator towards the poles &#x2013; with the whole plant world seemingly layered one on top of the other as one ascended the mountains. The vegetation zones ranged from the tropical plants down in the valleys to the lichens that he had encountered near the snow line. Towards the end of his life, Humboldt often talked about understanding nature from &#x2018;a higher point of view&#x2019; from which those connections could be seen; the moment when he had realized this was here, on Chimborazo. With &#x2018;a single glance&#x2019;, he suddenly saw the whole of nature laid out before him. <br><br>When they returned from Chimborazo, Humboldt was ready to formulate his new vision of nature. In the Andean foothills, he began to sketch his so-called <i>Naturgem�lde</i>, an untranslatable German term that can mean a &#x2018;painting of nature&#x2019; but it also implies a sense of unity or wholeness. It was, as Humboldt later explained, a &#x2018;microcosm on one page&#x2019;. Unlike the scientists who had previously classified the natural world into tight taxonomic units along a strict hierarchy, filling endless tables with categories, Humboldt now produced a drawing. <br><br>&#x2018;Nature was a living whole,&#x2019; he later said, not a &#x2018;dead aggregate&#x2019;. One single life, he said, had been poured over stones, plants, animals and mankind. It was this &#x2018;universal profusion with which life is everywhere distributed&#x2019; that most impressed Humboldt. Even the atmosphere carried the kernels of future life &#x2013; pollen, insect eggs and seeds. Life was everywhere and those &#x2018;organic powers are incessantly at work&#x2019;, he wrote. Humboldt was not so much interested in finding new isolated facts but in connecting them. Individual phenomena were only important &#x2018;in their relation to the whole&#x2019;, he explained. They were the parts that made the whole. <br><br>Depicting Chimborazo in cross-section, the <i>Naturgem�lde</i> strikingly illustrated nature as a web in which everything was connected. On it, Humboldt showed plants distributed according to their altitudes, ranging from subterranean mushroom species to the lichens that grew just below the snow line. At the foot of the mountain was the tropical zone of palms and, further up, the oaks and fern-like shrubs that preferred a more temperate climate. Every plant was placed on the mountain precisely where Humboldt had found them. <br><br>Humboldt produced his first sketch of the <i>Naturgem�lde</i> in South America and then published it later as a beautiful three-foot by two-foot drawing. To the left and right of the mountain he placed several columns that provided related details and information. By picking a particular height of the mountain (as given in metres in the first left- and right-hand column), one could trace connections across the table and the drawing of the mountain to learn about gravity, say, or the blueness of the sky, humidity, atmospheric pressure, temperature, chemical composition of the air, as well as what species of animals and plants could be found at different altitudes. Humboldt showed eleven zones of plants, along with details of how they were linked to changes in altitude, temperature and so on. All this information could then be linked to the other major mountains across the world, which were listed according to their height in the fourth column to the left. <br><br>This variety and richness, but also the simplicity of the scientific information depicted, was unprecedented. Humboldt was the first scientist to present such data visually. The <i>Naturgem�lde</i> showed for the first time that nature was a global force with corresponding climate zones across continents. Humboldt saw &#x2018;unity in variety&#x2019;. Instead of placing plants in their taxonomic categories, he saw vegetation through the lens of climate and location: a radically new idea that still shapes our understanding of ecosystems today.<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>The Invention of Nature </b>by Andrea Wulf.

Clarke), is best known for his Robot, Galactic Empire, and Foundation series.<br><br>Michael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning critic for <i>The Washington Post </i>and the author of the memoir <i>An Open Book </i>and of four collections of essays: <i>Readings, Bound to Please, Book by Book, </i>and <i>Classics for Pleasure.<br></i>From the Introduction by Michael Dirda<br><br>It is late summer, 1941. A young Jewish intellectual, an admirer of Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, suddenly finds himself musing about historical determinism, individual initiative and the ideal society. Why did Rome fall? Was the Christian religion a means of preserving ancient culture? What forms of government and economic system are best for mankind? Democratic representation with capitalistic competition? Enlightened despotism? A meritocracy of the best and the brightest?<br><br>Having come of age in 1930s' New York, the young intellectual would have heard fervent Trotskyites on street corners proclaim that history advances through class struggle and through the conflict between evolving political and economic ideologies. He already knew that Arnold Toynbee, in <i>A Study of History</i>, contended that civilizations have their seasons &#x2014; they rise, grow stagnant without sufficient challenges, eventually decay and fall. Still other thinkers, among them H.G. Wells, were convinced that the world should be governed by scientists, with rational benevolence. Wasn't that the theme of the recent movie, <i>Things to Come</i> (1936), with its vision of a perfectly ordered, chrome-bright "world of tomorrow"?<br><br>Still, all these systems and theories made historical change seem a cut-and-dried affair, quite logical, utterly inevitable. Yet where was the individual in these grand schemes of Marx and Toynbee and Wells? If only impersonal forces determined the course of events, how did one account for a Hitler?&nbsp; An upstart from nowhere, he had manipulated the German people with a mesmerist's power, promulgated a manifest destiny for his chosen elite, declared a Thousand-Year Reich. Clearly, the so-called F�hrer viewed himself as a Great Man, able to reshape his time as did Alexander and Napoleon before him. Such overreachers truly make history, don't they?<br><br>So Isaac Asimov, a twenty-one-year-old Columbia graduate, must have thought and wondered when he sat down at his typewriter that summer of 1941. However, what the young writer eventually produced was neither a turgid sociological tract nor a summa of world history. Instead, through a series of stories, Asimov tracked the breakdown of a smug conspicuously rich and stultified civilization, while also portraying the efforts of a highly committed group of activists to hasten the birth of a new and more glorious future society. In effect, he took the central myth of the 1930s and '40s &#x2014; lived out and believed in by Communists, Fascists, the International Brigade and New Deal Democrats alike &#x2014; and re-imagined it, with spaceships, in a galaxy far, far away. Science fiction is, after all, the art of extrapolation.<br><br>By the time Asimov brought his much loved series to a halt in 1949, he had written eight stories and novellas depicting the collapse of a Galactic Empire, the war-torn feudal period that followed, and the mysterious Foundation established to preserve civilization in a time of barbarism. Gathered together into book form &#x2014; what SF fans call a "fix-up" &#x2014; the stories required three volumes: <i>Foundation </i>(1951), <i>Foundation and Empire</i> (1952) and&nbsp; <i>Second Foundation </i>(1953). At the 1955 World Science Fiction Convention this trilogy was enthusiastically voted "the greatest all-time science-fiction series." Period. In the view of many, the assembled sequence also represents a watershed in literary history. A noted SF editor Donald Wollheim quickly realized: "Stores published before <i>Foundation</i> belong to the old line, the stories published after belong to 'modern' science fiction."<br><br>*<br><br>Isaac Asimov (1920-92) grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. Something of a whiz kid, he graduated early from high school and attended Columbia University, first as an undergraduate and later as a biochemistry graduate student. After earning his Ph. D., he taught for many years at Boston University before giving up the academic life in 1958 to become a full-time writer.<br><br>As a teenager, Asimov had been a devoted reader of the pulp magazines at his father's candy store: <i>Wonder Stories</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. In their pages one could follow the galactic adventures of E. E. "Doc" Smith's "Skylark of Space," shudder at "The Human Pets of Mars" and fight alongside "Tumithak of the Corridors." Before long, the teenaged Asimov begun to crank out his own short stories; the first to be published "Marooned on Vest," appearing in <i>Amazing</i> in 1939. After many rejections, he shortly thereafter broke into <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; the premier magazine in the field &#x2014; with "Trends" (originally titled, with a&nbsp; kind of clairvoyance, "Ad Astra" &#x2014; i.e., "to the stars"). That "yarn" appeared in the same July 1939 issue as A. E. van Vogt's first story ("Black Destroyer," almost certainly a partial inspiration for the film <i>Alien</i>) and only a month before Robert A. Heinlein's first story, "Lifeline." thus began the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which would last until roughly 1950.<br><br>Asimov developed quickly as a writer. He sold "Robbie," his first robot story, to <i>Super Science Stories</i> in 1940 (where its title was changed to "Strange Playfellow"), and his later ones to <i>Astounding</i>. Asimov always claimed it was John. W. Campbell, Jr., that magazine's legendary editor, who devised the central "Three Laws of Robotics" during a conversation at the end of 1940:<br><br>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br><br>By 1941, Asimov was ready for what would prove his <i>annus mirabilis</i>. On March 17, when this still very young writer was visiting the <i>Astounding</i> offices, Campbell unexpectedly quoted a passage from Emerson: "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God . . ." What, the magazine editor wondered, would happen to people who suddenly saw stars for the first time? Asimov said he didn't know. Campbell answered: "I think they would go mad. I want you to write a story about that."<br><br>According to the first volume of his autobiography, <i>In Memory Yet Green</i>, Asimov began the story on March 18, 1941 and finished it on April 8. "Nightfall," as he called it, was then published as the cover story for the September issue of <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; along with the conclusion of Robert Heinlein's short novel <i>Methuselah's Children</i> and in the company of Alfred Bester's now classic "Adam and No Eve." Since that day, "Nightfall" has been judged, over and over again, to be the greatest science-fiction story ever written. Happily neither Heinlein nor Bester would ever complain about this, since the former quickly established himself as the best science-fiction writer of all time and the latter's 1956 novel, <i>The Stars My Destination</i>, is widely and rightly, viewed as the best single SF novel ever written.<br><br>Having formulated the Laws of Robotics and then written "Nightfall," one might assume that young Asimov would devote the rest of his time to his studies. Hardly. That fall <i>Astounding</i> also brought out the first two Foundation stories. Years later, Asimov recalled the genesis of the series:<br><br><i>On August 1, 1941, I took the subway to Campbell's office after class was over. On the way down I racked my brain for a story idea. Failing, I tried a device I sometimes used. I opened a book at random and then tried free association, beginning with whatever I first saw. <br><br>The book I had with me was a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays. I opened it to </i>Iolanthe <i>&#x2014; to the picture of the Fairy Queen throwing herself at the feet of Private Willis, the sentry. Thinking of sentries, I thought of soldiers, of military empires, of the Roman Empire &#x2014; of the Galactic Empire &#x2014; aha! . . ."<br><br>Why should I not write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and the return of feudalism, written from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? I thought I knew how to do it for I had read Edward Gibbon's </i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire<i> from first page to last at least twice, and I had only to make use of that.<br><br>I was bubbling over by the time I got to Campbell's, and my enthusiasm was catching. It was perhaps too catching for Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do. <br><br>"That's too large a theme for a short story," he said.<br><br>"I was thinking of a novelette," I said, quickly, adjusting my thoughts.<br><br>"Or a novelette. It will have to be an open-ended series of short stories."<br><br>"What?" I said, weakly.<br><br>"Short stories, novelettes, serials, all fitting into a particular future history, involving the fall of the First Galactic Empire, the period of feudalism that follows and the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.<br><br>"What?" I said, even more weakly. <br><br>"Yes, I want you to write an outline for the future history. Go home and write an outline."<br><br>There Campbell had made a mistake. Robert Heinlein was writing what he called the "Future History Series." He was writing various stories that fitted into one niche or another of the series, and he wasn't writing them in order. Therefore he had prepared a Future History outline that was very detailed and complicated, so that he would keep everything straight. Now Campbell wanted me to do the same.<br><br>Heinlein, however, was Heinlein &#x2014;and Asimov was not Heinlein.<br><br>I went home dutifully, and began preparing an outline that got longer and longer and stupider and stupider until I finally tore it up. It was quite plain that I couldn't work with an outline. (To this day I cannot &#x2014; for any of my stories, articles, or books, whether fiction or nonfiction.)<br><br>On August 11, therefore, I started the story I had originally intended to write (with modifications that resulted from my discussions with Campbell), and the heck with possible future stories. I'd worry about them when the time came &#x2014; and </i>if<i> the time came.<br><br>Since the First Galactic Empire was breaking down (in my story), certain scientists had set up a Foundation on a world at the rim of the Galaxy, purportedly to prepare a vast encyclopedia of human knowledge, but actually to cut down the period of feudalism and hasten the rise of the Second Empire. I called the story &#x2014; drum roll, please &#x2014; "Foundation." <br><br></i>Later in his autobiography, Asimov notes that he submitted "Foundation" on September 8 and on September 17 received a check for $126. From the on, Foundation stories appeared periodically, if irregularly, until the end of the 1940s. When they were collected, Asimov added one more to form a new introduction, and also changed most of the titles.</p><h2>Henry Babysits</h2><p>Henry the Duck has his hands full when all the neighbors bring their babies for him to watch one day.</p><p>Some time ago, Robert Quackenbush received a letter from a young reader who was puzzled by his name.

He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Columbia in 1925 and 1927 and went on to study medieval French and Sanskrit at the universities of Paris and Munich. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years.

Today there are three cats for every dog on the planet, and yet cats remain more mysterious, even to their most adoring owners. Unlike dogs, cats evolved as solitary hunters, and, while many have learned to live alongside humans and even feel affection for us, they still don't quite get us&#x201d; the way dogs do, and perhaps they never will. But cats have rich emotional lives that we need to respect and understand if they are to thrive in our company. <br><br>In <i>Cat Sense</i>, renowned anthrozoologist John Bradshaw takes us further into the mind of the domestic cat than ever before, using cutting-edge scientific research to dispel the myths and explain the true nature of our feline friends. Tracing the cat's evolution from lone predator to domesticated companion, Bradshaw shows that although cats and humans have been living together for at least eight thousand years, cats remain independent, predatory, and wary of contact with their own kind, qualities that often clash with our modern lifestyles. Cats still have three out of four paws firmly planted in the wild, and within only a few generations can easily revert back to the independent way of life that was the exclusive preserve of their predecessors some 10,000 years ago. Cats are astonishingly flexible, and given the right environment they can adapt to a life of domesticity with their owners but to continue do so, they will increasingly need our help. If we're to live in harmony with our cats, Bradshaw explains, we first need to understand their inherited quirks: understanding their body language, keeping their environments however small sufficiently interesting, and becoming more proactive in managing both their natural hunting instincts and their relationships with other cats.<br><br>A must-read for any cat lover, <i>Cat Sense</i> offers humane, penetrating insights about the domestic cat that challenge our most basic assumptions and promise to dramatically improve our pets' lives and ours.<br><br></p><p><b>John Bradshaw</b> is Foundation Director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol.

In this authoritative and engrossing full-scale biography, Walter Isaacson shows how the most fascinating of America&#39;s founders helped define our national character. In a sweeping narrative that follows Franklin&#39;s life from Boston to Philadelphia to London and Paris and back, Isaacson chronicles the adventures of the spunky runaway apprentice who became, during his 84-year life, America&#39;s best writer, inventor, media baron, scientist, diplomat, and business strategist, as well as one of its most practical and ingenious political leaders. He explores the wit behind Poor Richard&#39;s Almanac and the wisdom behind the Declaration of Independence, the new nation&#39;s alliance with France, the treaty that ended the Revolution, and the compromises that created a near-perfect Constitution. Above all, Isaacson shows how Franklin&#39;s unwavering faith in the wisdom of the common citizen and his instinctive appreciation for the possibilities of democracy helped to forge an American national identity based on the virtues and values of its middle class.</p><p></p><h2>Action Selling: How to Sell Like a Professional, Even If You Think You Are One</h2><p>&#34;Action Selling: How to Sell Like a Professional, Even if You Think You Are One&#34; is the first book in the Action Selling Book Series.

In the midst of it all, he reveals the adventure that accompanies carving out a place for yourself in a foreign country&#x2014;under baffling conditions&#x2014;while never losing sight of the magic that inspired him to move to the City of Light many years ago, and to truly make his home there.</p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ has been a professional cook and baker for most of his life; he spent nearly thirteen years at Berkeley's Chez Panisse until he left the restaurant business in 1999 to write books. He is the author of six books, including <i>My Paris Kitchen, The Perfect Scoop,&nbsp;</i>and <i>The Sweet Life in Paris</i>.&nbsp;David has been featured in <i>Bon App�tit</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, <i>Cook's Illustrated</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Saveur</i>, <i>Travel + Leisure</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and more. He moved to Paris in 2004 and turned davidlebovitz.com into one of the first phenomenally popular food and living blogs.<p>1</p><p>&#x201c;Pee in this cup.&#x201d;</p><p>The stern doctor sat behind the desk in her dim beige office, under-illuminated by a metal desk lamp fitted with a bulb that cast a dull glow over everything and seemed to have been last changed when De Gaulle was president. She handed me a paper receptacle that felt like it was made of newsprint and averted her eyes--somewhat.</p><p>It had been eight exasperating months since I&#x2019;d signed the first promesse de vente and finally, I was close to the day when I would sign the acte de vente, the deed to my apartment in Paris. Or as time-pressed Parisians shorten it: l&#x2019;appart.</p><p>And here I was. The last acte I had to do was . . . just . . . relax . . . Which, considering the circumstances--being vaguely scrutinized by a doctor while standing in the middle of her cabinet, anxiously trying to fill a paper cup that threatened to crumple in my free hand--is not an easy task.</p><p>Maybe if I&#x2019;d had a grand caf� cr�me beforehand . . . or better yet, a big glass of ros�, I thought, while she--and I--waited for me to breathe a shudder of relief, so she could go home and I could get the final approval on my bank loan. We were in the same position (well, not literally), waiting for the same thing. She&#x2019;d already taken a blood sample and rigorously checked my vital signs to make sure I was in the bonne sant� required by the French bank to approve my mortgage.</p><p>I&#x2019;d applied for a few mortgages before, in the United States, but a medical screening had never been part of the approval process. I was puzzled, until a banker explained it to me: &#x201c;Monsieur Lebovitz, we don&#x2019;t want you to die.&#x201d; Which was something I couldn&#x2019;t disagree with--they wanted confirmation that I would live long enough to pay for the place. (Later I learned that they had good reason to worry, because that almost didn&#x2019;t happen.) I urgently needed to complete this final task before they&#x2019;d release the funds for the loan and I could finally take possession of the apartment I&#x2019;d spent years looking for.</p><p>Ever since my arrival in Paris a decade earlier, I had been living in a charming chambre de bonne, one of the minuscule top-floor apartments tucked just under the curving roof of a blocky yet regal Haussmannian building in the Bastille quarter of Paris. Chambres de bonne are single rooms where the maids (les bonnes) once lived. Nowadays, they&#x2019;re sought after by Parisians because they are often the cheapest places to buy, especially the ones in buildings without elevators. (Which is why you rarely see Parisians needing to engage in the unsightly spectacle of le jogging--although I&#x2019;d recently spotted one woman running in the Tuileries, doing her laps in espadrilles.) Other advantages are the spectacular views, and best of all, there are no neighbors in heels clomping around above you.</p><p>In Paris, the more high-strung the woman, the higher the heels, which I know from firsthand experience. And not just from one of the many narrow misses I&#x2019;ve had with them playing the Parisian version of &#x201c;chicken&#x201d; (not sure if they call it poulet . . .) on the sidewalks to see who will move first. (I&#x2019;ve learned that holding a baguette and swinging it parallel to the ground, just below waist level, gets anyone you&#x2019;re up against to move first.) But because there was one living below me who was so hyperactive that I could hear her racing around at all hours--most often between one and four thirty in the morning, when her heels resonated so loudly that the noise woke me up a full floor above her.</p><p>Another thing that made it hard to sleep in that apartment was the weather, though I didn&#x2019;t mind staying awake, listening to the pounding thunderstorms that lash down on Paris. The pelting rain in the fall and winter drowned out the traffic noises on the busy boulevard below and would eventually soothe me to sleep. But come summer, sleeping--or doing anything else--became impossible, as the temperatures soared under the zinc roof (which I lived directly beneath) to as high as 110�F. The only upside was that I had a lot of premelted chocolate always on hand.</p><p>The chambres de bonne were built to house the help, so were intentionally Spartan. The apartments didn&#x2019;t have kitchens and some had separate back staircases so the domestics could discreetly slip into the family&#x2019;s apartment without having to pass through the front door. Bathrooms were shared Turkish toilets in the hallways. So next time you&#x2019;re in Paris and lusting over a rooftop apartment listed in a real estate agency window, check to see if there is a bathroom . . . and an elevator, unless you don&#x2019;t mind climbing up seven flights of stairs. More and more of the buildings do have elevators now, but many still share one bathroom with everyone else on the floor. (And speaking of floors, they&#x2019;re often Turkish toilets, which consist of a hole in the floor with two places to stand your ground.) Fortunately, my landlord had previously lived in the apartment, so I wasn&#x2019;t sharing any bathrooms, which was good for my neighbors considering the length of time it was taking for me to finalize my real estate transaction. Sure, the chambres de bonne are charming, or &#x201c;cozy,&#x201d; as they&#x2019;d say in American real estate lingo, but most are just a single room, 200 to 300 square feet (18 to 28 square meters), or roughly the size of an American kitchen.</p><p>I tried to buy the apartment I had been living in, because it was incredibly well situated. My place had been joined with another chambre next door, so I actually had two rooms, which made all my other friends who lived in a chambre de bonne (singular) jealous. It also had a phone booth&#x2013;size elevator that I took for granted--until it broke. I was crammed in there when it malfunctioned, and barely managed to crook my elbow to lift the emergency phone to my ear to call the elevator company. Eventually, someone picked up, but the woman on the other end told me to call back in two hours because all the repair people were at lunch. Then she hung up. I broke the door to get out, which I didn&#x2019;t get punished for, but walking up seven flights of stairs for the next four months was definitely punishment enough.</p><p>The apartment was in the Bastille, a lively neighborhood adjacent to the Marais and the Place des Vosges, and is a major m�tro hub with lots of connections so I could easily hop to anywhere in Paris. I was just steps from the largest outdoor market in the city. I could grab my market basket, which I kept next to my front door, and be perusing a spectacular selection of French cheeses, wines, p�t�s, fruits, and vegetables within minutes. But best of all, it was the unbeatable view of Paris that I didn&#x2019;t think I could ever leave. Each day I&#x2019;d wake up and unlatch the wooden shutters, and after I adjusted to the barrage of light, I was presented with a spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower and a collage of small and grand buildings in the foreground, with Sacr�-C&#x153;ur church off to the right and the Seine to the left; a spectacular mosaic of Paris that seemed like it was all mine. At night, just before closing the deteriorating shutters, which I was sure would one day blow off in one of the abrupt storms that whips through the city without notice (during one such storm, I almost lost an arm trying to close a shutter that wanted to play tug-of-war with me), I would take one final gaze at the twinkling lights before climbing into bed. If you&#x2019;ve seen the movie Ratatouille, I shared the same view that Chef Linguini&#x2019;s apartment had (people even say I resemble the movie&#x2019;s main character--the cook, not the rat). One night, I was lying in bed watching the film on my television, which was just next to that window, when I sat up in surprise--at that moment in the film, my doppelg�nger&#x2019;s Pixar-perfect view was an exact replica of my Paris panorama. How could I ever move?</p><p>One of the few concessions to modernity in the apartment was the dishwasher (which, to a cookbook author, is the most important concession), but with a little polish, the apartment would have been the perfect home for me in Paris. All it needed were new floors, paint, an updated bathroom and kitchen, and air-conditioning (my French friends chided me for being tr�s am�ricain when I broke down and bought a portable air conditioner after searing my fingertips on my computer keyboard during one of the withering summer heat waves). Alas, it wasn&#x2019;t to be: the landlord didn&#x2019;t want to sell, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him. So after seven or eight years of living life at the top of the most beautiful city in the world, it was time to get back down to earth. Unfortunately when you&#x2019;re at the top, there&#x2019;s only one way to go.</p><p>I&#x2019;d moved to Paris from San Francisco, which, like Paris, is a collection of neighborhoods, or little villages, surrounded by water. Paris is a clearly defined area outlined by the p�riph�rique, an always-clogged highway that circles the city where tempers flare as people seethe behind the wheel, heady from diesel fumes, lighting one cigarette off the stub of another as they inch forward, moving through the congested highway at the pace of an escargot. Le p�riph separates the city from the inner banlieues (suburbs), which are not to be confused with American suburbs, with their lush lawns, kids running through sprinklers, and minivans parked in driveways. These banlieues are notorious for their grim housing projects, inhabited by many immigrants and disenfranchised people, known as les banlieusards.</p><p>Parisians have never made it easy for outsiders to become part of their city, as all of us who have gone through the process of renewing our visas can attest. One year, the folder of documents that I&#x2019;d spent six months meticulously compiling and organizing to meet the unpredictable demands was folded in half and slid into the garbage can by a poker-faced bureaucrat without a second thought. (I swear I detected a bit of a smirk, though.) Being from California, I probably would have felt better if she had separated the paper clips from the pages and tossed them into their respective recycling bins.</p><p>I went through a lot to get to Paris, starting my life over again not just in a new city, but in a new country, plunging into another culture, with a language I didn&#x2019;t speak. (I could see my teacher at the Alliance Fran�aise, where I crammed for my move by taking a two-week intensive course before I left San Francisco, crying a little inside every time I tried to form a complete sentence in French.)</p><p>People have asked me repeatedly why I moved here, but I could never provide a more satisfying answer than &#x201c;For the croissants!&#x201d; But upon reflection, I&#x2019;d ended a nearly thirteen-year tenure at Chez Panisse in California, a restaurant strongly influenced by market-based French country cooking: la cuisine du march�. The climate and ingredients of Northern California were similar to those you&#x2019;d find in the south of France, whose residents are similarly smitten with the exuberant foods from their region--dewy goat cheeses (back in the &#x2019;80s, people in Berkeley assumed we were serving them rounds of tofu), olive oils that resonated with the terroir of their provenance in each glossy puddle, fresh herbs used liberally, robust wines, crates overflowing in the summer with pulpy, deep-red tomatoes, and a mutual love of aromatic garlic permeating everything, from a�oli to agneau. All those ingredients figured heavily into the cuisines of France and the San Francisco Bay Area, two places where people are obsessed with what&#x2019;s on their plate. The transition was natural for me.</p><p>Another obsession shared by both San Francisco and Paris is real estate: it&#x2019;s rare that you attend a party or gathering in either city and the subject doesn&#x2019;t eventually become a topic of discussion, with plenty of grousing about the rising prices of homes and apartments. Because of fixed boundaries, including oceans and p�riphs, which won&#x2019;t be changing anytime soon, prices in the highly desirable city of Paris will only go in one direction: up.</p><p>Decades in San Francisco made me realize that those who predicted prices were too high and would surely drop were setting themselves up for disappointment. It&#x2019;s wishful thinking, but people have convinced themselves it&#x2019;s going to happen, much like the communists who meet in their Paris offices under posters of tightly clustered workers marching in the streets alongside their comrades with raised fists, in the belief that France will move toward the ideal of communism. I don&#x2019;t want to burst anyone&#x2019;s bubble, but communism hasn&#x2019;t worked out quite as expected elsewhere in the world, and France will likely remain a capitalist country. Few are willing to give up the fashionable black coat they saw in the window of that boutique in the Marais which was un must because it looked so good on them, or give up their maisons secondaires, the vacation homes that every French family seems to have, where they retreat to every summer. With Paris being such a desirable place to live, rising housing prices are here to stay.</p><p>As I learned in San Francisco, if I was going to remain in Paris, the best assurance of staying for the long term was to own a place of my own.</p><p>So in spite of folder-folding bureaucrats, I decided to stay in Paris. I&#x2019;d acclimated to life here. I was on a first-name basis with the clerks in my local shops, especially the ones at the office supply store where I replenished the supply of paper and ink cartridges one plows through by photocopying the slew of paperwork that becomes a part-time job. I&#x2019;d also become friendly with the vendors at my local market, where my life revolved around my twice-weekly rounds of shopping for fruits, vegetables, sausages, p�t�s--whatever caught my eye--and stopping off at the bakery on the corner for a bien cuite (well-cooked) baguette (which to me are the only kind) on the way home.</p><p>The longer I lived in my neighborhood, the better I knew the vendors: Who had the strawberries that would be bright red all the way through when I cut into them later. Whose Comt� was aged longer, giving it a sharper, nuttier flavor. Who would give me a better price if I bought several kilos of apricots because I was testing recipes and needed an entire case. And most important of all, who would let me pick out my own fruits and vegetables in a country where picking out your own produce can trigger a blistering reprimand (or even a hand-slapping, as a friend in Provence found out). It&#x2019;s a good thing they retired the guillotine in 1977 before I arrived, because even though I know I&#x2019;m not supposed to, I can&#x2019;t resist touching and selecting fruit that I&#x2019;m buying. It&#x2019;s too frustrating for me to order fruit and vegetables by pointing and saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that one of those . . . and three of those, no . . . not that one, the lettuce on the left . . . and a few of those nectarines, oh . . . no, wait . . . I want smaller ones. Can you rifle around for some that are riper? Or ones that have a redder blush, for a photograph? . . . Okay, now that I&#x2019;ve asked you to do that, can I get four of those pears? I&#x2019;m testing a recipe and need pears that weigh 125 grams each . . . and two need to be ripe right now, and two that will be ripe for tomorrow. Sure, I can wait . . .&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Silva Mind Control Method: The Revolutionary Program by the Founder of the World&#39;s Most Famous Mind Control Course</h2><p>Since &#34;The Silva Mind Control Method&#34; was first published in hardcover, over one million people (including top celebrities) have graduated from Mind Control training to use their minds at a deeper and more effective level, even in their sleep!</p><p></p><h2>Facing Messy Stuff in the Church: Case Studies for Pastors and Congregations</h2><p>A collection of fourteen case studies that give church leaders practical and realistic preparation to handle tough issues like sexual harassment, pornography, divorce, and the effects of abortion.

Obsessed with themes of solitude, childhood, madness and death, Pizarnik explored the shifting valences of the self and the border between speech and silence. In her own words, she was drawn to "the suffering of Baudelaire, the suicide of Nerval, the premature silence of Rimbaud, the mysterious and fleeting presence of Lautr�amont,&#x201d; as well as to the &#x201c;unparalleled intensity&#x201d; of Artaud&#x2019;s &#x201c;physical and moral suffering.&#x201d;</p><p><p><strong>Alejandra Pizarnik</strong> (1936&#x2013;1972) was born in Argentina and educated in Spanish and Yiddish.

THE REPLACEMENT<br><br>The British Lines, Near Ypres, <br>Western Belgium&#x2013;Autumn 1915<br><br>The darkness was complete, a slow march into a black, wet hell. He was the last man in the short column, one part of a line of twenty men, guided by the low sounds in front of him, soft thumps, boots on the sagging duckboards. There were voices, hard whispers, and, close to him, a hissing growl from the sergeant: &#x201c;Keep together, you bloody laggards! No stopping!&#x201d;<br><br>No one answered, no protests. Each man held himself tightly inside, the words of the sergeant swept aside by the voices in their own minds, a tight screaming fear, the only response they could have to this march into the black unknown.<br><br>They had come as so many had come, crossing the Channel on small steamers, filing through the chaos of the seaports, and after a few days, they had boarded the trains. There was singing, bands playing along the way, the raucous enthusiasm of young recruits. They had stared curiously at the French and Belgian countryside, returning the smiles of the people who greeted them at every stop, and few noticed that as the trains moved farther inland, closer to the vast desolation of the Western Front, the villagers were quieter, the faces more grim. Then the trains stopped, and the men were ordered out onto roads that had seen too much use, repaired and repaired again. They would march now only at night, hidden from the eyes in the air, the aeroplanes that sought out targets for German artillery. If the roads were bad, the small trails and pathways were worse, men stumbling in tight files, moving closer still to the front. The fire in the recruits was dampened now, by the weather, the ever-present mud, the soggy lowlands of Flanders. Then came the first sounds, low rumbles, louder as they marched forward. Even in the darkness, both sides threw a nightly artillery barrage at the other, some firing blind, some relying on the memory of the daytime, a brief glimpse of movement on the road, convoys of trucks and horse-drawn carts. Some had the range, knew every foot of the road that stretched out behind the enemy&#x2019;s lines. Throughout the night, the targets might be unseen, but they were there, and every man at every big gun knew that in the darkness, each road, each small path might be hiding great long lines of men, new recruits, the replacements who marched quietly to the front.<br><br>His guts were a twisted knot, his arms pulled to his sides, one hand tightly curled around his rifle, his eyes straining at the unseen man in front of him. The soft wood beneath him was bouncing now, sagging low, and his knees buckled, trying to match the rhythm of the footing. There were more soft sounds, splashes, the duckboards spread across some chasm of black water. His mind tried to focus, one foot in front of the other, keeping his boots on the narrow wooden boards. He imagined a great pond, inky and deep, the duckboards some kind of bridge, but the image was not complete, his mind shouting at him, to the front, focus to the front. The man in front of him made a low grunt, water splashing, the man stepping hard, trying to catch himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Bloody hell!&#x201d;<br><br>He stumbled as well, his boots down in the water, the duckboards sagging too low, and he felt the man suddenly beneath him. He fought for his balance, falling now, one hand pushing down hard on the man&#x2019;s back.<br><br>&#x201c;Get off me, you bloody bastard!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up, Greenie! On your feet!&#x201d; It was the sergeant again, and rough hands grabbed his arm, jerking him upright. Beneath him, the other man pulled himself to his feet, both of them gripped hard by the sergeant.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay awake! Keep moving!&#x201d;<br><br>He wanted to whisper something to the man in front, an apology, but the march was on again, the rhythm of his boots blending with the others, soft sounds of water and wood. He felt the wetness in his socks now, the chill of the water adding to the cold hard stone in his chest.<br><br>The replacements had been called Greenies from their first moment on the march, green troops, sent forward to rebuild the front-line units, fill the gaping holes in the British regiments. Their training had been rapid, some said far too rapid, a nation scrambling to find new soldiers, more soldiers than anyone had thought they would need. They had been parceled out into small squads by a system none of them understood, led by unfamiliar sergeants, hard, angry men who had done this work before, the men who knew the trails, who could find their way in the dark.<br><br>He had joined with many of his friends from the village, a small farming town near the Scottish border. No one had thought the army would be away from home through Christmas, but the newspapers spoke of great battles, a new horror for the world, words and places that seemed foreign and fantastic. In the village, there had been talk of young men who would not come home, strangers mostly, sons of farmers barely known, word of families in mourning. His friends spoke of the adventure of it all, that if any of them missed it, or worse, avoided it, they would be called shirkers, traitors to the king. No matter the accounts in the newspapers, a massive and bloody war that had swallowed the whole of Europe, few who lived in the small village could resist the call, to march in song and parade to join a war the likes of which Britain had not seen since Napoleon.<br><br>He tried to adjust his massive backpack, the darkness broken by a small clink of metal, his canteen rattling against the trenching tool that hung down the side of his pack. He had become used to the weight, the clumsy mass just part of the rhythm of the march, bouncing with him on the duckboards.<br><br>The ground beneath him was hard now, the wood not moving, no water, and the boots were louder, echoes in the darkness. He heard voices to one side, a group of men, still unseen, and the voices hushed as they passed. He stared through the darkness, wondering, officers perhaps, speaking of plans and tactics. He glanced up, no stars, the night still thick and black. A soft breeze swept past him, a wave of sharp odor. He hunched his shoulders, fought off the smell, but it was all through him, burning his nose, then harder still, sharp and sickening. The man in front of him made a choking sound, others as well, hard coughs, curses.<br><br>&#x201c;Keep moving! That&#x2019;s just the roses, you bloody greenies! Plenty more to come!&#x201d;<br><br>The smell was settling dull in his mind, his brain numbing to it. The breeze seemed to stop, but the smells were still there, all around him, and the man in front of him said, &#x201c;A horse. A bloody horse!&#x201d;<br><br>He moved past the shape, could hear the hard buzz of flies, was grateful now for the dark. He squinted his eyes, fought through the worst of the smell, stared down for a long while. The march continued, more hard odor, different, unseen decay, and he focused on his footsteps, tried not to think of what lay rotting in the deep mud around him. He could see the faint outline of his boots, the motion steady, constant, realized he could see. He looked ahead of him, could see a shape, the man in front of him outlined <br>in a dark gray mist. He glanced to the side, more shapes, low hulks, movement. The duckboards began to sag again, more splashes, and he looked down, each step pushing the water out in low ripples. He stared ahead, past the shadow of the man, tried to see beyond, to see where they were going, what the land looked like. The sergeant moved past him now, another hard whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;The first trench line is just ahead. We&#x2019;ll be at the guard post in a minute. Step down easy. We&#x2019;re close. No talking. None! Old Fritz is just out there a ways!&#x201d;<br><br>He could hear something new, a slight quiver in the sergeant&#x2019;s voice. There was none of the profane anger, the mindless screaming at men who had done nothing wrong. He thought of the word, close. How close? Close enough that the sergeant is afraid? He felt his legs turning cold, the hard chill in his chest spreading. There was another low voice, unfamiliar, the words barely reaching him. He could see another man, a gray shape, an officer, speaking in low tones to the sergeant, the man&#x2019;s words finding him through the heavy mist.<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant Cower . . . you&#x2019;re late . . . daylight . . . heads low.&#x201d;<br><br>Behind the two men there was another low, fat hulk. But the soft dawn was spreading, and he could see a shape, a fat round barrel. His heart jumped, hard tightness&#x2013;of course, a cannon. A big one. The carriage was hidden, buried in the wet muddy ground, the barrel pointing out in the direction of the march. The sergeant was moving toward them again, waving his arm, a downward motion, words coming now, but there was a new sound, a hard whistle, ripping the air above them. The ground in front of him erupted, a mass of earth and men, and he felt himself pushed back, rolling down, his face hitting the mud, his backpack lurching up over his shoulders. There was another great scream, another shell landing a few yards to his left, the ground under him rising up in one great gasp, then settling back down. More dirt fell on him, heavy, a sharp punch into his backpack, nearly rolling him over. He gripped the ground, his hands clawing into the mud, but the sounds kept rolling over him, thunderous bursts, the ground still bouncing beneath him. He tried to breathe, blew a sharp breath out, his face buried in water, tried to raise his head, another great blast, lifting him up, dropping him again hard in the mud. He gasped for air, turned his face to the side, saw only smoke, no men, no great gun. He forced a breath, his throat seared by the heat. He looked for the sergeant, tried to shout, something, not words, fought for air, another scream above him, another great blast behind him, other sounds now, more screams. Men. The dirt settled on him again, and he thought of the sergeant, the man&#x2019;s words, trench line, close. He raised his head up, saw motion, a man running, then another blast, the man disappearing, swept away. He tried to stand, the backpack nearly falling over his head, the weight pulling him over. He tried to run, his legs useless, soft jelly, felt a hand now, a hard grip under his arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go! Move!&#x201d;<br><br>The hand released him, and he reached down for his rifle, saw only water, the voice again.<br><br>&#x201c;Move!&#x201d;<br><br>The man was running out ahead, and he followed, pumped his legs through the churned-up mud, the backpack bouncing wildly. He saw the man drop down, a large round hole, more black water, and he followed, stumbled down, splashed hard, water up to his waist.<br><br>&#x201c;Down!&#x201d;<br><br>He rolled to one side, the backpack sinking beneath him, could sit now, water to his chest, the muddy rim of the hole above him, protection. The shells still came over them, but fell farther back now, the impact jarring him in hard rumbles. He wiped at his eyes, but the mud on his hands made it worse, and he blew hard through his nose, dislodging mud and water. His hands were empty, a new burst of fear, so many days of drill, of screaming sergeants, the routine pounded hard into every man, the punishment. Never lose your rifle. . . .<br><br>&#x201c;My rifle . . . I dropped it! I have to go back. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The hand clamped hard on his shoulder again, and he saw the face of the sergeant.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay put! There&#x2019;s more rifles to be found. You wounded?&#x201d;<br><br>The question confused him, and he looked down, saw only water, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You better check, Greenie. But keep down.&#x201d;<br><br>He moved his hands along his sides, was suddenly terrified of what he would find. He felt for his legs, his hands probing slowly beneath the dark water, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>The sergeant did not laugh, said, &#x201c;Roll over. Let me have a look. You could bloody well have a hole somewhere. There&#x2019;s no pain, sometimes. Just a piece . . . goes missing.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned, the backpack rising up beneath him. Now there was a <br>short laugh, and the sergeant said, &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t appear you been hit. But the quartermaster&#x2019;s gonna be mighty ticked. You let Fritz blow the hell out of your pack.&#x201d;<br><br>He slid the pack off, moved it around, saw shreds of cloth, the contents, his clothes, food rations, ripped to small bits of cloth and metal. He stared at the useless mass, pushed it away from him, watched it disappear into the water.<br><br>&#x201c;Say a prayer, Greenie. Probably saved your neck.&#x201d;<br><br>He probed again, his hands feeling his chest, stomach, and the sergeant was serious now.<br><br>&#x201c;Naw, Greenie, you&#x2019;re fine. If I hadn&#x2019;t gotten you into this shell hole, you might have joined your mates. Direct hit . . .&#x201d; The sergeant paused, looked up into the thick gray sky. &#x201c;Shelling&#x2019;s stopped. For now. You best get moving. Trenches should be ahead, if there&#x2019;s still anything left. Chances are, those boys fared better than you greenies. Take a look. See if anyone&#x2019;s moving.&#x201d;<br><br>He slid to one side of the shell hole, adjusted his helmet, eased his head up slowly, and the sergeant said, &#x201c;Go on, there&#x2019;s nothing to fear now. Fritz can&#x2019;t see you back this far. If they start shelling again, you know where to find me.&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced up out of the hole, saw low drifting smoke, mounds of dirt, duckboards scattered, splintered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d; He turned, saw the sergeant staring at him, saw the man shivering, the water around him moving in low ripples.<br><br>&#x201c;You best go on. They&#x2019;re waiting for the greenies up ahead. You&#x2019;ll see the trenches, a hole bigger&#x2019;n this one, pile of sandbags. Tell the guards you&#x2019;re a replacement for B Company. They&#x2019;ll know where to put you.&#x201d; He paused, took a long breath, spit something out into the black water. &#x201c;Double-time it, though. Fritz could start his guns again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the way. I&#x2019;ll wait for the others. You have to lead the way!&#x201d;<br><br>He felt a small cold panic rising, stared at the sergeant, who said, &#x201c;Go! I&#x2019;ll be staying here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the others!&#x201d;<br><br>He was angry now, furious at this man, this bully, the big man with <br>the temper and the hard hands, quick to punish, quick in his abuse of the replacements. From the beginning of the march, the sergeant had been <br>on them, cursing them, finding fault with every step. He moved through the water, closer to the sergeant, said, &#x201c;Damn you! You cannot just order me. . . . I cannot just go alone! We must find the others!&#x201d;<br><br>The sergeant closed his eyes for a moment, said softly, &#x201c;Direct hit. The first shell . . . there are no others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re mad! Twenty men!&#x201d;<br><br>He scrambled to the edge of the shell hole, eased his head up, searched the dull gray. His heart was pounding again, the cold returning. He climbed up farther, pulled himself out of the hole, crawled slowly away. The smoke was mostly gone, the air now thick with wet mist, a light rain beginning to fall. He paused, listened, tried to hear voices, heard only the faint hiss of the rain. He glanced beyond the shell hole, toward the front lines, the place where the trenches were supposed to be. He raised his head up farther, felt suddenly naked, no rifle, nothing in his hands, no heavy mass on his back. He felt light, like an animal, stood up slowly, bent low, began to move back, followed the shattered trail of the duckboards. He could see the muddy ground broken into round patches of water, shell holes in every direction. He crouched low, saw a rifle, thought, mine . . . but the butt was missing, useless. He eased close to a shell hole, said in a low voice, &#x201c;Anyone . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>He peered over the edge, saw an arm in the water, fingers curled in a loose grip around a rifle. He fought the sickness rising inside him, reached down, pulled at the rifle, the hand giving way, the arm now rising slowly, the man&#x2019;s body pulled free of the mud below. He tried not to look, but the face turned up in the water, fam...</p><h2>The Cheese Board: Collective Works: Bread, Pastry, Cheese, Pizza [A Baking Book]</h2><p><b>From the enormously popular Berkeley cheese shop and bakery, a collection of 150 classic recipes along with a history of the store and&nbsp;a cheese primer, all accompanied by 50 photographs.</b><br><br><i><br>The Cheese Board was there, a hole in the wall with a line out the door, before Chez Panisse was so much as a gleam in my eye. When the restaurant was conceived, I wanted it to be in North Berkeley so the Cheese Board would be nearby, because I knew I would be among friends.</i><br>-Alice Waters, from the Foreword<br>When a tiny cheese shop opened in Berkeley, California, in 1967, there was little hint of what the store-and the neighborhood-would grow into over the next 30 years. The Cheese Board became a collective a few years later and Chez Panisse opened across the street, giving birth to one of the country's most vibrant food neighborhoods, the epicenter of California's culinary revolution. Equal parts bakery, cheese store, pizzeria, and gathering place, the Cheese Board is a patchwork of the local community, where a passion for good food runs deep. THE CHEESE BOARD presents over 100 recipes for the store's classic breads, pastries, and pizzas, along with a history of the collective and an extensive cheese primer.</p><p>THE CHEESE BOARD COLLECTIVE hailed as a paradigm of collective-run business. The Cheese Board shop is frequently cited in national food media &#34;best of&#34; lists and is a major food destination in Berkeley, California."The Cheese Board is the soul of my neighborhood in Berkeley. I go there probably three times a week-not only for cheese and the world-class bread and pizza, but also for the sheer sense of community that permeates the place. This fine book, long overdue, will now enable us groupies to bring even deeper shades of the inimitable Cheese Board spirit into our kitchens." -Mollie Katzen, author of <i>The Moosewood Cookbook</i>"What a treasure this book is-filled with recipes for Cheese Board specialties I'�?ve loved for years, plus the inside story on how this quirky business really runs. After reading it, I wanted to drop everything and join the collective." -Janet Fletcher, author of <i>The Cheese Course</i>"This book is important, first because it is a lively historical document of a truly amazing place, but also because the recipes are so wonderful. My pizza repertoire has been infused with a fabulous jolt of new ideas." -Peter Reinhart, author of <i>American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza and The Bread Baker'�?s Apprentice</i>"The Cheese Board has all of the best things: cheeses and olives; breads and pizzas; the most knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive staff ever. The collective'�?s policy of encouraging people to taste everything in the shop created a sensation, a destination, and an education. Now all of the Cheese Board'�?s expertise and excellent recipes are here to behold." -Michael Wild, chef-owner of BayWolf and author of <i>The BayWolf Restaurant Cookbook</i>"A real expression of the Cheese Board'�?s philosophy, this book speaks in the voices of the members of the collective, revealing how their work intersects with and pervades their lives.

But after years in professional basketball and as an executive for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Procter &amp; Gamble, he cashed in his retirement fund for a two-acre plot just outside Milwaukee's largest public housing project. The area was a food desert with only convenience stores and fast-food restaurants to serve the needs of locals. <br><br>Despite financial challenges and daunting odds, Allen built the country's preeminent urban farm-a food and educational center that now produces enough produce and fish year-round to feed thousands. Employing young people from the neighboring housing project and community, Growing Power shows how local food systems can help troubled youths, dismantle racism, create jobs, bring urban and rural communities closer together, and improve public health. Today, Allen's organization helps develop community food systems across the country. <br><br>An eco-classic in the making, <i>The Good Food Revolution</i> is the story of Will's personal journey, the lives he has touched, and a grassroots movement that is changing the way our nation eats.</p><p>After retiring from professional basketball and executive positions at Kentucky Fried Chicken and Procter &amp; Gamble, Will Allen became the CEO of Growing Power.

The election of an African American president has led many to argue that the color of a person&#x2019;s skin has become irrelevant, discrimination is a thing of the past, and we now live amid a post-racial culture. In my view, that&#x2019;s wishful thinking. A long list of contrary arguments can be made&#x2014;but the most useful, in this foreword, would be to mention how this country has, since its inception, produced its food. The history of agriculture in the United States is largely a history of racial exploitation. From the slavery that formed the rural economy of the South to the mistreatment of migrant farm workers that continues to this day, our food has too often been made possible by someone else&#x2019;s suffering. And that someone else tends not to be white.</p><p>Will Allen knows this history all too well. His family lived it. His parents escaped sharecropping, the form of servitude that replaced the plantation system after the Civil War, and like millions of other African Americans, they fled north. Their Great Migration was often an attempt not only to seek a better life in the city, but also to leave behind the rural customs and trappings and mindset associated with centuries of hardship and pain. The great tragedy for many African Americans, as Allen explains in this book, is that in losing touch with the land and with traditions handed down for generations, they also lost an important set of skills: how to grow and prepare healthy food. By heading north they frequently traded one set of problems for another.</p><p>It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the epidemic of diet-related illnesses now sweeping the country&#x2014;obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes&#x2014;are harming blacks the most. They are more likely to be poor, to live in communities without supermarkets, farmers markets, or produce stores. But their neighborhoods are crammed with fast food restaurants, liquor stores, and convenience stores selling junk food. These are toxic environments when it comes to finding healthy food. Industry apologists like to argue that our decisions about what to eat are the result of &#x201c;personal responsibility&#x201d; and &#x201c;freedom of choice.&#x201d; A recent study in Southern California contradicts that sort of argument. It found that a person&#x2019;s life expectancy can be predicted on the basis of his or her zip code. The wealthy in Beverly Hills are likely to live ten years longer than the poor in South Central Los Angeles. It&#x2019;s hard to place the blame solely on your personal choices, when life expectancy can be determined in large part by something that none of us can control: the neighborhood in which we were born.</p><p>Today the two leading causes of preventable death in the United States are smoking and eating too much unhealthy food. When both of those habits became unpopular among the white, well-educated, upper-middle class, the companies that sell cigarettes and junk food focused their marketing efforts on African Americans, people of color, and the urban poor. Long after smoking was linked to cancer and heart disease, the tobacco companies aggressively sought new customers in minority communities. An internal marketing memo by an executive at Brown&amp;Williamson, the company that once sold Kool cigarettes, explained the industry&#x2019;s thinking. &#x201c;Clearly the sole reason for B&amp;W&#x2019;s interest in the black and Hispanic communities is the actual and potential sales of B&amp;W products,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;This relatively small and tightly knit minority community can work to B&amp;W&#x2019;s marketing advantage, if exploited properly.&#x201d; Thanks to that sort of thinking, and the cigarette advertising that has flooded African American communities, the lung cancer rates among blacks are much higher than among whites. As the fast food chains pursue a similar strategy, disproportionately marketing their products to African Americans and fueling the obesity rate in low-income communities, the health disparity between blacks and whites continues to grow.</p><p>At Growing Power, the organization led by Will Allen, you will find a completely different sort of mentality. Instead of trying to earn profits by harming the poor, it hopes to create an alternative to the nation&#x2019;s centralized industrial food system. It&#x2019;s working to teach people how to grow food, cook food, and embrace a way of living that&#x2019;s sustainable. Allen has transformed a dilapidated set of greenhouses in downtown Milwaukee into the headquarters of an urban farming network that now operates in seven states. He has developed innovative methods of growing fruits and vegetables, of producing fish through aquaculture, and of using earthworms to transform waste products into fertilizer&#x2014;all in the heart of a major city. To say that Allen&#x2019;s thinking is unconventional would be an understatement. But that&#x2019;s what has made him a pioneer of urban agriculture and a leader in today&#x2019;s food movement. He understood, long before most, that America&#x2019;s food system is profoundly broken&#x2014;and that a new one, locally based and committed to social justice, must replace it.</p><p>The new farming techniques being perfected at Growing Power are not yet reliably profitable. This fact does not diminish their importance and must be viewed in a larger perspective. America&#x2019;s current agricultural system was hardly created by free market forces. Between 1995 and 2011, American farmers received about $277 billion in federal subsidies. And the wealthiest 10 percent of farmers received 75 percent of those subsidies. Almost two-thirds of American farmers didn&#x2019;t receive any subsidies at all. In addition to getting massive support from taxpayers, the current system is imposing enormous costs on society&#x2014;costs that aren&#x2019;t included on the balance sheets of the major fast food and agribusiness companies. Last year the revenues of the fast food industry were about $168 billion, an impressive sum. But estimates of the cost of foodborne illnesses in the United States and of the nation&#x2019;s obesity epidemic, as calculated by researchers at Georgetown and Cornell universities, are even higher. Those two costs alone add up to about $320 billion. By any rational measure, this industrial food system isn&#x2019;t profitable or self-sufficient. Although Growing Power receives foundation grants, it&#x2019;s creating a system that will be sustainable. And the good that Growing Power&#x2019;s doing in the communities it serves&#x2014;the heart attacks and strokes and hospital visits it helps people to avoid, the sense of empowerment it gives, the families it brings together&#x2014;represent a form of social profit that&#x2019;s impossible to quantify.</p><p>This book tells Will Allen&#x2019;s story and lays out his farming philosophy. Instead of running from the past or trying to deny it, Allen has confronted the dark legacy of slavery and sharecropping. He has tried to reconcile the rural and urban experiences of African Americans, imagining a future that can combine the best elements of the two. He has spent years working among the poor, preaching a message of compassion and self-reliance. I admire what Will Allen has achieved. And I hope others, many others, will soon follow in his path.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Willie Mae Kenner</i></p><p>ESCAPE</p><p>She held a one-way ticket.</p><p>In December of 1934, my mother, Willie Mae Kenner, stood in the waiting room for colored people at the train station in Batesburg, South Carolina. She was twenty-five years old. Her two young boys, my older brothers, were at her side. She was heading to Union Station in Washington, D.C. She was trying to escape our family&#x2019;s long history in agriculture.</p><p>I imagine her on this day. Willie Mae was known to be beautiful and headstrong. Many local men had called her &#x201c;fine&#x201d;&#x2014;she had strong legs, smooth skin, a round and lovely face, and thoughtful eyes. She also had dreams that were too big for her circumstances. She and her husband, and seven of her nine siblings, were sharecroppers: tenant farmers who gave up half of the crop they planted and harvested each season in exchange for the right to pick it. It was the only life that she had known.</p><p>My mother held different hopes in her heart, both for herself and her children. She had fought to obtain a teaching degree from Schofield Normal and Industrial School, a two-year college initially set up after the Civil War by Quakers, to educate free slaves. She wanted to be a teacher. Her family noticed that when she was required to pick cotton or asparagus, she did the work without complaint. Yet she wore a long, flowing dress on top of her work shirt and pants while in the fields. It was as if she wanted to find a way to give grace and dignity to work that often provided neither.</p><p>From the train station in Batesburg, Willie Mae was trying to escape asparagus and cotton. At the time, the South was still in the thrall of &#x201c;Jim Crow&#x201d;: the rigid set of laws set up after the Civil War to separate whites and blacks in almost every part of public life. The 1896 Supreme Court decision in <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>&#x2014;allowing &#x201c;separate but equal&#x201d; facilities for black people&#x2014;meant that my mother could not share the same train car with white passengers. She and her children could not even wait in the same area for the train to come. Her train car sat directly behind the coal car, where men shoveled the rocks into the roaring engine. The smoke of the engine blew through the car&#x2019;s windows and seeped into her clothes. She and her two boys would need to use a bathroom marked not &#x201c;Men&#x201d; or &#x201c;Women&#x201d; but &#x201c;C,&#x201d; for &#x201c;Colored.&#x201d;</p><p>Her journey was to take her to the nation&#x2019;s capital, where Willie Mae planned to reunite with her husband, James Kenner. His friends called him &#x201c;Major,&#x201d; for reasons I never understood. He had left South Carolina after falling into debt. During the Great Depression, the price for cotton had dropped to only 5 cents a pound&#x2014;down from 35 cents only a decade earlier. Major had found himself owing more to his landowner at the end of the planting season than when he began it. Sharecropping had begun to feel like slavery under another name.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no money here,&#x201d; he told my mother shortly before leaving.</p><p>Major found a small place to live in Ken Gar, an all-black neighborhood on the edge of Kensington, Maryland, ten miles from the White House. He sent word to my mother to come. Major was now building houses instead of planting crops. Willie Mae had never seen the place she was going to call home.</p><p>My mother left the South before I was born. I know from relatives that she decided against boarding her departing train at the nearest station, in Ridge Spring, likely out of concern that loca...</p></p><h2>Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World&#39;s Best Market</h2><p><b>The next bull market is here. It&#x2019;s not in stocks. It&#x2019;s not in bonds. It&#x2019;s in commodities &#x2013;and some smart investors will be riding that bull to record returns in the next decade.<br></b><br>Before Jim Rogers hit the road to write his bestselling books <i>Investment Biker </i>and<i> Adventure Capitalist,</i> he was one of the world&#x2019;s most successful investors. He cofounded the Quantum Fund and made so much money that he never needed to work again. Yet despite his success, Rogers has never written a book of practical investment advice&#x2013;until now. <br><br>In <i>Hot Commodities,</i> Rogers offers the lowdown on the most lucrative markets for today and tomorrow. In 1998, gliding under the radar, a bull market in commodities began. Rogers thinks it&#x2019;s going to continue for at least fifteen years&#x2013;and he&#x2019;s put his money where his mouth is: In 1998, he started his own commodities index fund. It&#x2019;s up 165% since then, with more than $200 million invested, and it&#x2019;s the single-best performing index fund in the world in any asset class. Less risky than stocks and less sluggish than bonds,, commodities are where the money is&#x2013;and will be in the years ahead. Rogers&#x2019;s strategies are simple and straightforward. You can start small&#x2013;a few thousand dollars will suffice. It&#x2019;s all about putting your money into stuff you understand, the basic materials of everyday life, like coal, sugar, cotton, corn, or crude oil. Once you recognize the cyclical and historical trading patterns outlined here, you&#x2019;ll be on your way.<br><br>In language that is both colorful and accessible, but Rogers explains why the world of commodity investing can be one of the simplest of all&#x2013;and how commodities are the bases by which investors can value companies, markets, and whole economies. To be a truly great investor is to know something about commodities.<br><br>For small investors and high rollers alike, <i>Hot Commodities</i> is as good as gold . . . or lead, or aluminum, which are some of the commodities Rogers says could be as rewarding for investors.</p><p>According to Jim Rogers, "commodities get no respect." Here are a few reasons why he thinks they should: they are easier to comprehend and study than stocks and behave more rationally since they are subject to the basic laws of supply and demand; they have outperformed many other investment options in recent years; it is foolish to ignore an entire sector of the marketplace; and a bull market is currently under way in commodities--a trend that Rogers expects to last for a least a decade longer. Further, Rogers believes that you cannot be a successful investor in stocks, bonds, or currencies without an understanding of commodities. <i>Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market</i> is designed to introduce the novice to the basics of investing in commodities as well as explain what they are and why they are important. In doing so, he shatters some myths about the relative risks of commodities, explains the relationship between the stock and commodities markets, and provides a succinct analysis and history of the global oil, gold, lead, sugar, and coffee markets. <p> Rogers also offers practical advice and information for beginners, including the best resources, how to read the commodities reports in the newspaper or on television, the various ways to open an account, information on index funds (such as Rogers' own index fund that he started in 1998), mechanisms, terminology, and other vital details people must know before investing. Clearly written and entertaining, <i>Hot Commodities</i> offers a solid introduction to investments that many people, including financial advisors, fail to give the proper respect. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Praise for Jim Rogers and <i>Adventure Capitalist</i></b> <p>"[Jim Rogers is] the Indiana Jones of finance."<br> &#x2014;<i>Time</i></p> <p>"Rogers has a knack for storytelling and drawing the reader in.

It is the story of an illness, a fight to live, and a race against death."<br><br>From the day he was born, Nick Traina was his mother's joy. By nineteen, he was dead. This is Danielle Steel's powerful personal story of the son she lost and the lessons she learned during his courageous battle against darkness. Sharing tender, painful memories and Nick's remarkable journals, Steel brings us a haunting duet between a singular young man and the mother who loved him--and a harrowing portrait of a masked killer called manic depression, which afflicts between two and three million Americans.<br><br>Nick rocketed through life like a shooting star. Signs of his illness were subtle, often paradoxical. He spoke in full sentences at age one. He was a brilliant, charming child who never slept. And at first, even his mother explained away his quicksilver moods. Nick always marched to a different drummer. His gift for writing was extraordinary, his musical talent promised a golden future. But by the time he entered junior high, Danielle Steel saw her beloved son hurtling toward disaster and tried desperately to get Nick the help he needed--the opening salvos of what would become a ferocious pitched battle for his life.<br><br>Even as he struggled, Nick's charisma and accomplishments remained undimmed. He bared his soul in his journal with uncanny insight, in searing prose, poetry, and song. When he was finally diagnosed and treated, it bought time, but too little. In the end, perhaps nothing could have saved him from the insidious disease that had shadowed him from his earliest years.<br><br>At once a loving legacy and an unsparing depiction of a devastating illness, Danielle Steel's tribute to her lost son is a gift of life, hope, healing, and understanding to us all.</p><p>Like Kurt Cobain, Nick Traina lived for punk rock (his bands made two CDs, <i>Gift Before I Go</i> and <i>17 Reasons</i>), succumbed to heroin addiction, and died of suicide. His mom, Danielle Steel, takes us through her 19 twister-like years with Nick in a memoir more affecting than her potboiler novels. Like his AWOL addict father, Nick had good looks, bad behavior, and a yen for the feminine. Five days before he died, he phoned a woman he saw in a centerfold and had a new girlfriend by nightfall. But his fun was ever haunted by manic depression. At age 11, he was a bed wetter who ate all the Tylenol and Sudafed in the house. He first considered suicide at 13, as Steel learned by reading his diaries after his death.<p> There is tension in this story--one doctor told Steel if she could get Nick to live to 30, he'd probably live a normal life span. (For example, Nick's troubled dad resurfaced, sober, soon after his son's death.) And Steel conveys a sense of the intelligence Nick used to conceal his learning disability, and the irreverent charm that alternated with irrational rages. Oliver Sacks has urged us not to ask what neurological disease a person has, but what sort of person the disease has got hold of. Steel gives us a vivid sense of the costs of the disease to a family--and of the person who was Nick Traina. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>The Nick Traina Foundation has been established to benefit mental health, music, and child-related causes, and other charitable organizations for assorted causes.

She explores the pivotal and interconnected roles played by gender and race in North Carolina politics from the period immediately preceding the disfranchisement of black men in 1900 to the time black and white women gained the vote in 1920. Gender and Jim Crow argues that the ideology of white supremacy embodied in the Jim Crow laws of the turn of the century profoundly reordered society and that within this environment, black women crafted an enduring tradition of political activism. According to Gilmore, a generation of educated African American women emerged in the 1890s to become, in effect, diplomats to the white community after the disfranchisement of their husbands, brothers, and fathers. Using the lives of African American women to tell the larger story, Gilmore chronicles black women&#39;s political strategies, their feminism, and their efforts to forge political ties with white women. Her analysis highlights the active role played by women of both races in the political process and in the emergence of southern progressivism. In addition, Gilmore illuminates the manipulation of concepts of gender by white supremacists and shows how this rhetoric changed once women, black and white, gained the vote.</p><p>Historian Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore examines an unfamiliar world in this groundbreaking study, the world of middle-class, educated black women at a time that was one of the nadirs of black-white relations in America. With the Supreme Court&#39;s affirmation of legal segregation, Southern black men found themselves disfranchised and excluded from politics. Black women filled that vacuum, Gilmore argues, making a place for themselves as ambassadors to the white community, and as activists on behalf of blacks, and bequeathing to their descendants a heritage of resistance that culminated in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and &#39;60s."This is an accessible, informative addition to an increasingly important area of study."-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br></p><h2>The Magnificent Book of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Creatures</h2><p><i>The Magnificent Book of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Creatures</i> takes young readers back millions of years to the Age of Dinosaurs, showcasing 36 incredible animals with rich, colorful illustrations and interesting facts.

Not only would it serve as the basis for a sound faith on the part of professing Christians, but it would also claim a place for Christianity in history. Christ's ministry, as Luke shows, is realized prophecy; it is that time during which God's promise of salvation was fulfilled. His teachings, healing, and acts of compassion are all part of the good news. In Luke's Gospel, Christ's message of salvation is directed to the weak, poor, and needy, with an emphasis on the importance of self-denial and of whole-hearted discipleship. Thus, while Luke is the most conscious historian of the Gospel writers, his history is a vehicle of theological interpretation in which the significance of Jesus is expressed.<br><br>In this commentary I. Howard Marshall calls attention to the theological message of Luke the Evangelist. His primary purpose is to exegete the text as it was written by Luke, so that the distinctiveness of Luke's Gospel may be seen.<br><br>Basing his commentary on the third edition of The Greek New Testament, Dr. Marshall also refers to many variant readings which are significant in this study. He provides fairly full information on the meanings of the Greek words used by Luke and shows which words and constructions occur frequently and are therefore characteristic of his style. It is by this meticulous analysis of the Greek that Luke's theological intentions can be objectively determined.</p><p>I.

Jackson, Sr.</b></p><p><b>Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>, was born January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia, the son and grandson of pastors. He graduated from Morehouse College and Crozer Theological Seminary, becoming at age 25 pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. He subsequently earned his Ph.D. from Boston University. In 1957 he and other civil rights leaders founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization he led until his death. A proponent of Gandhian principles of non-violence, he led many protests and demonstrations for civil rights, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 29, 1963, where he delivered his famous &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x201d; speech. Winner of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, he continued to fight for civil rights, the eradication of poverty and the end of the Vietnam War. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, TN. <br><br><b>Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.</b>, is the founder and president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, an organization committed to fighting for social, political, and economic justice for people of all races, genders, and creeds. A two-time candidate for President of the United States, Rev. Jackson has been called the &#x201c;conscience of the nation.&#x201d; Rev. Jackson is also renowned for his efforts around the world to spread the promise of democracy, human rights, and peace. Rev. Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, reside in Chicago and are the proud parents of five children.I had planned to submit myself to imprisonment two or three days after our demonstrations began. It didn&#x2019;t take long after returning to Birmingham, however, to recognize the existence of a problem that made it unwise and impractical for me to go to jail before something had been done to solve it. <br> &nbsp;<br> We had been forced to change our timetable twice. We had had to make a strategic retreat until after the run-off and had lost contact with the community for several weeks. We had returned now to a city whose political power structure was divided. We had returned to find that our own people were not united. There was tremendous resistance to our program from some of the Negro ministers, businessmen and professionals in the city. This opposition did not exist because these Negroes did not want to be free. It existed for several other reasons. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Negro in Birmingham, like the Negro elsewhere in this nation, had been skillfully brainwashed to the point where he had accepted the white man&#x2019;s theory that he, as a Negro, was inferior. He wanted to believe that he was the equal of any man; but he didn&#x2019;t know where to begin or how to resist the influences that had conditioned him to take the line of least resistance and go along with the white man&#x2019;s views. He knew that there were exceptions to the white man&#x2019;s evaluation: a Ralph Bunche, a Jackie Robinson, a Marian Anderson. But to the Negro, in Birmingham and in the nation, the exception did not prove the rule. <br> &nbsp;<br> Another consideration had also affected the thinking of some of the Negro leaders in Birmingham. This was the widespread feeling that our action was illtimed, and that we should have given the new Boutwell government a chance. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had been one of the first to voice this criticism. The <i>Washington Post, </i>which covered Birmingham from the first day of our demonstrations, had editorially attacked our &#x201c;timing.&#x201d; In fact, virtually all the coverage in the national press at first had been negative, pictur ing us as irresponsible hotheads who had plunged into a situation just when Birmingham was getting ready to change overnight into Paradise. The sudden emergence of our protest seemed to give the lie to this vision. <br> &nbsp;<br> In Montgomery, during the bus boycott, and in the Albany, Georgia, campaign, we had had the advantage of a sympathetic and understanding national press from the outset. In Birmingham we did not. It is terribly difficult to wage such a battle without the moral support of the national press to counteract the hostility of local editors. The words &#x201c;bad timing&#x201d; came to be ghosts haunting our every move in Birmingham. Yet people who used this argument were ignorant of the background of our planning. They did not know we had postponed our campaign twice. They did not know our reason for attacking in time to affect Easter shopping. Above all they did not realize that it was ridiculous to speak of timing when the clock of history showed that the Negro had already suffered one hundred years of delay. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not only were many of the Negro leaders affected by the administration&#x2019;s position, but they were themselves indulging in a false optimism about what would happen to Birmingham under the new government. The situation had been critical for so many years that, I suppose, these people felt that any change represented a giant step toward the good. Many truly believed that once the influence of Bull Connor had faded, everything was going to be all right. <br> &nbsp;<br> Another reason for the opposition within the Negro community was resentment on the part of some groups and leaders because we had not kept them informed about the date we planned to begin or the strategy we would adopt. They felt that they were being pulled in on something they had no part in organizing. They did not realize that, because of the local political situation, we had been forced to keep our plans secret. <br> &nbsp;<br> We were seeking to bring about a great social change which could only be achieved through unified effort. Yet our community was divided. Our goals could never be attained in such an atmosphere. It was decided that we would conduct a whirlwind campaign of meetings with organizations and leaders in the Negro community, to seek to mobilize every key person and group behind our movement. <br> &nbsp;<br> Along with members of my staff, I began addressing numerous groups representing a cross section of our people in Birmingham. I spoke to 125 business and professional people at a call meeting in the Gaston Building. I talked to a gathering of two hundred ministers. I met with many smaller groups, during a hectic oneweek schedule. In most cases, the atmosphere when I entered was tense and chilly, and I was aware that there was a great deal of work to be done. <br> &nbsp;<br> I went immediately to the point, explaining to the business and professional men why we had been forced to proceed without letting them know the date in advance. I dealt with the argument of timing. To the ministers I stressed the need for a social gospel to supplement the gospel of individual salvation. I suggested that only a &#x201c;dry as dust&#x201d; religion prompts a minister to extol the glories of heaven while ignoring the social conditions that cause men an earthly hell. I pleaded for the projection of strong, firm leadership by the Negro minister, pointing out that he is freer, more independent, than any other person in the community. I asked how the Negro would ever gain his freedom without the guidance, support and inspiration of his spiritual leaders. <br> &nbsp;<br> I challenged those who had been persuaded that I was an &#x201c;outsider.&#x201d; I pointed out that Fred Shuttlesworth&#x2019;s Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights was an affiliate of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and that the Shuttlesworth group had asked S.C.L.C. to come to Birmingham, and that as president of S.C.L.C., I had come in the interests of aiding an S.C.L.C. affiliate. <br> &nbsp;<br> I expanded further on the weary and worn &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; charge, which we have faced in every community where we have gone to try to help. No Negro, in fact, no American, is an outsider when he goes to any community to aid the cause of freedom and justice. No Negro anywhere, regardless of his social standing, his financial status, his prestige and position, is an outsider so long as dignity and decency are denied to the humblest black child in Mississippi, Alabama or Georgia. <br> &nbsp;<br> The amazing aftermath of Birmingham, the sweeping Negro Revolution, revealed to people all over the land that there are no outsiders in all these fifty states of America. When a police dog buried his fangs in the ankle of a small child in Birmingham, he buried his fangs in the ankle of every American. The bell of man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man does not toll for any one man. It tolls for you, for me, for all of us.</p><h2>Love Life for Every Married Couple</h2><p>Physician Ed Wheat has helped thousands of couples improve their love-lives and build happier marriages.

The dialogue is lively with each character&#39;s voice wholly distinct. As often happens at the end, one wants more time with these characters--and there is. R.F.W.

Joe Hagan provides readers with a backstage pass to storied concert venues and rock-star hotel rooms; he tells never before heard stories about the lives of rock stars and their handlers; he details the daring journalism (Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, P.J. O&#x2019;Rourke) and internecine office politics that accompanied the start-up; he animates the drug and sexual appetites of the era; and he reports on the politics of the last fifty years that were often chronicled in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. <br> &nbsp;<br> Supplemented by a cache of extraordinary documents and letters from Wenner's personal archives, <i>Sticky Fingers&nbsp;</i>depicts an ambitious, mercurial, wide-eyed rock and roll fan of who exalts in youth and beauty and learns how to package it, marketing late sixties counterculture as a testament to the power of American youth. The result is a fascinating and complex portrait of man and era, and an irresistible biography of popular culture, celebrity, music, and politics in America. <b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2017:</strong> Jann Wenner wanted a biography. As founder and Editor in Chief of <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine, he has wielded an outsized influence over popular culture for decades, and his biography would have to match. When Wenner launched his &#x201c;sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper&#x201d; in 1967, it also shot him into the whirlwind; soon he was socializing with the likes of John and Yoko, Mick , Janis, and Jimi, while indulging in the excesses inextricably intertwined with the rock-and-roll lifestyle. His success was deserved; as an editor, his eye was confident and sharp, and as the magazine grew in stature through the 1970s, his direction fostered the careers of Hunter S. Thompson, Annie Leibovitz, and Greil Marcus, just three of the many counterculture outliers to grace its pages. (Maybe grace isn&#x2019;t always the right word.) <p>One might assume that he&#x2019;d been planning a monument to himself all along, but in hiring Joe Hagan to write it, he might have gotten more than he bargained for. Wenner kept an exhaustive archive of all of his records and correspondence, and he gave Hagan full access. He also gave his permission--or at least acceded to it&#x2014;to write the story as he saw fit, with all the sticky facts that unfailingly accompany a life so large. And, man, did Hagan pull it off. <em>Sticky Fingers</em> is overstuffed with anecdotes, interviews, and history that not only evoke Wenner&#x2019;s persona in all its grandiosity and creative energy, but also that of the era he helped create. One way to know that the book is good: Although Wenner reportedly regrets the result (he has denounced it as &#x201c;tawdry&#x201d;), he doesn&#x2019;t dispute it. Hagan did him a favor. This is certainly not hagiography, but ultimately, Wenner will loom larger for it. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em></p><b>JOE HAGAN</b> has written for <i>New York,</i> <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many other publications.

Photographs capture not only his ineffable sense of style, but also his aura of vulnerability, intensity, sexuality, and charm. <i>Sinatra: The Photographs</i> focuses on the decades after the war, when he towered over the American entertainment landscape. These were the years of the Rat Pack and Las Vegas, socializing with Jack Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and making music with Nelson Riddle, Count Basie, and Quincy Jones. Featured is the best work by a group of photographers who helped shape the public image of Sinatra: Ted Allan, Bob Willoughby, Ed Thrasher, Sid Avery, and Bernie Abramson. Photographs by these men form the nucleus of the images gathered in this book, which are accompanied by illuminating commentary on Sinatra by the people who knew him best.</p><p><b>Andrew Howick</b> has helped research, curate, and edit one of the world&#x2019;s largest collections of Frank Sinatra photography at the photo agency mptvimages.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Barbara Sinatra</b> is Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s widow and the author of <i>Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank</i>.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Images of Sinatra carry as powerful a punch as his voice.

Every day, 1,100 adults and children are added to the government disability rolls because they have become newly disabled by mental illness, with this epidemic spreading most rapidly among our nation&#x2019;s children. What is going on?<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Anatomy of an Epidemic </i>challenges readers to think through that question themselves. First, Whitaker investigates what is known today about the biological causes of mental disorders. Do psychiatric medications fix &#x201c;chemical imbalances&#x201d; in the brain, or do they, in fact, <i>create </i>them? Researchers spent decades studying that question, and by the late 1980s, they had their answer. Readers will be startled&#x2014;and dismayed&#x2014;to discover what was reported in the scientific journals.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then comes the scientific query at the heart of this book: During the past fifty years, when investigators looked at how psychiatric drugs affected <i>long</i>-<i>term </i>outcomes, what did they find? Did they discover that the drugs help people stay well? Function better? Enjoy good physical health? Or did they find that these medications, for some paradoxical reason, <i>increase </i>the likelihood that people will become chronically ill, less able to function well, more prone to physical illness? <br>&nbsp;<br>This is the first book to look at the merits of psychiatric medications through the prism of long-term results. Are long-term recovery rates higher for medicated or unmedicated schizophrenia patients? Does taking an antidepressant decrease or increase the risk that a depressed person will become disabled by the disorder? Do bipolar patients fare better today than they did forty years ago, or much worse? When the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) studied the long-term outcomes of children with ADHD, did they determine that stimulants provide any benefit? <br>&nbsp;<br>By the end of this review of the outcomes literature, readers are certain to have a haunting question of their own: Why have the results from these long-term studies&#x2014;all of which point to the same startling conclusion&#x2014;been kept from the public? <br>&nbsp;<br>In this compelling history, Whitaker also tells the personal stories of children and adults swept up in this epidemic. Finally, he reports on innovative programs of psychiatric care in Europe and the United States that are producing good long-term outcomes. Our nation has been hit by an epidemic of disabling mental illness, and yet, as <i>Anatomy of an Epidemic </i>reveals, the medical blueprints for curbing that epidemic have already been drawn up.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>ROBERT WHITAKER </b>is the author of <i>Mad in America, The Mapmaker&#x2019;s Wife, </i>and <i>On the Laps of Gods, </i>all of which won recognition as &#x201c;notable books&#x201d; of the year. His newspaper and magazine articles on the mentally ill and the pharmaceutical industry have garnered several national awards, including a George Polk Award for medical writing and a National Association of Science Writers Award for best magazine article. A series he cowrote for the <i>Boston Globe </i>on the abuse of mental patients in research settings was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1998.1<br>A Modern Plague<br><br><i>&#x201c;That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to a pertinent answer.&#x201d; </i>&#x2014;Jacob Bronowski (1973)<br><br>This is the story of a medical puzzle. The puzzle is of a most curious sort, and yet one that we as a society desperately need to solve, for it tells of a hidden epidemic that is diminishing the lives of millions of Americans, including a rapidly increasing number of children. The epidemic has grown in size and scope over the past five decades, and now disables 850 adults and 250 children <i>every day</i>. And those startling numbers only hint at the true scope of this modern plague, for they are only a count of those who have become so ill that their families or caregivers are newly eligible to receive a disability check from the federal government.<br><br>Now, here is the puzzle.<br><br>As a society, we have come to understand that psychiatry has made great progress in treating mental illness over the past fifty years. Scientists are uncovering the biological causes of mental disorders, and pharmaceutical companies have developed a number of effective medications for these conditions. This story has been told in newspapers,<br>magazines, and books, and evidence of our societal belief in it can be found in our spending habits. In 2007, we spent $25 billion on anti-depressants and antipsychotics, and to put that figure in perspective, that was more than the gross domestic product of Cameroon, a nation of 18 million people.<br><br>In 1999, U.S. surgeon general David Satcher neatly summed up this story of scientific progress in a 458- page report titled <i>Mental Health</i>. The modern era of psychiatry, he explained, could be said to have begun in 1954. Prior to that time, psychiatry lacked treatments that could &#x201c;prevent patients from becoming chronically ill.&#x201d; But then Thorazine was introduced. This was the first drug that was a specific antidote to a mental disorder&#x2014;it was an <i>antipsychotic </i>medication&#x2014;and it kicked off a psychopharmacological revolution. Soon <i>antidepressants </i>and <i>antianxiety </i>agents were discovered, and as a result, today we enjoy &#x201c;a variety of treatments of well documented efficacy for the array of clearly defined mental and behavioral disorders that occur across the life span,&#x201d; Satcher wrote. The introduction of Prozac and other &#x201c; second- generation&#x201d; psychiatric drugs, the surgeon general added, was &#x201c;stoked by advances in both neurosciences and molecular biology&#x201d; and represented yet another leap forward in the treatment of mental disorders.<br><br>Medical students training to be psychiatrists read about this history in their textbooks, and the public reads about it in popular accounts of the field. Thorazine, wrote University of Toronto professor Edward Shorter, in his 1997 book, <i>A History of Psychiatry, </i>&#x201c;initiated a revolution in psychiatry, comparable to the introduction of penicillin in general medicine.&#x201d; That was the start of the &#x201c;psychopharmacology era,&#x201d; and today we can rest assured that science has proved that the drugs in psychiatry&#x2019;s medicine cabinet are beneficial. &#x201c;We have very effective and safe treatments for a broad array of psychiatric disorders,&#x201d; Richard Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College, informed readers of the <i>New York Times </i>on June 19, 2007. Three days later, the <i>Boston Globe, </i>in an editorial titled &#x201c;When Kids Need Meds,&#x201d; echoed this sentiment: &#x201c;The development of powerful drugs has revolutionized the treatment of mental illness.&#x201d;<br><br>Psychiatrists working in countries around the world also understand this to be true. At the 161st annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, which was held in May 2008 in Washington, D.C., nearly half of the twenty thousand psychiatrists who attended were foreigners. The hallways were filled with chatter about schizophrenia, bipolar illness, depression, panic disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and a host of other conditions described in the APA&#x2019;s <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,</i>and over the course of five days, most of the lectures, workshops, and symposiums told of advances in the field. &#x201c;We have come a long way in understanding psychiatric disorders, and our knowledge continues to expand,&#x201d; APA president Carolyn Robinowitz told the audience in her opening- day address. &#x201c;Our work saves and improves so many lives.&#x201d;<br><br>But here is the conundrum. Given this great advance in care, we should expect that the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States, on a per- capita basis, would have declined over the past fifty years. We should also expect that the number of disabled mentally ill, on a per- capita basis, would have declined since the arrival in 1988 of Prozac and the other second- generation psychiatric drugs. We should see a two- step drop in disability rates. Instead, as the<br>psychopharmacology revolution has unfolded, the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States has <i>skyrocketed</i>. Moreover, this increase in the number of disabled mentally ill has accelerated further since the introduction of Prozac and the other secondgeneration psychiatric drugs. Most disturbing of all, this modernday plague has now spread to the nation&#x2019;s children.<br><br>The disability numbers, in turn, lead to a much larger question. Why are so many Americans today, while they may not be disabled by mental illness, nevertheless plagued by chronic mental problems&#x2014;by recurrent depression, by bipolar symptoms, and by crippling anxiety? If we have treatments that effectively address these disorders, why has mental illness become an ever- greater health problem in the United States?</p><h2>Through the Kitchen Window</h2><p>Physical description; [76]p : col.ill ; 25cm.

Here is a rich and absorbing survey of the common myths that connect all cultures, Eastern and Western, from antiquity to the present day. With stunning power, the stuff of legend is explored in all its drama and magnificence. There are stories of gods and men&#x2014;and legendary heroes from Zeus to King Arthur to the &#x201c;Superman&#x201d; of modern media; tales of heaven, earth, and the origins of man from Hindu, American Indian, and Western thought; and retellings of mythic quests and legendary lovers, from the epic wanderings of Odysseus to the tragedy of Tristram and Iseult and the Krishna marriage of Heaven and Earth. This extraordinary work, compiled and arranged by theme from stories of creation to tales of death and rebirth, examines and compares the world&#x2019;s myths that have shaped our common past and continue to influence us still.</p><p>Joseph Campbell was interested in mythology since his childhood in New York, when he read books about American Indians, frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History, and was fascinated by the museum's collection of totem poles. He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Columbia in 1925 and 1927 and went on to study medieval French and Sanskrit at the universities of Paris and Munich. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years. During the 1940s and '50s, he helped Swami Nikhilananda to translate the Upanishads and <b>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</b>. The many books by Professor Campbell include <b>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</b>, <b>Myths to Live By</b>, <b>The Flight of the Wild Gander</b>, and <b>The Mythic Image</b>.

He lives with his wife and three children on the edge of Dartmoor, in the southwest of England.Rarely does a travel guide stand the test of time quite like this colorful and hypothetically practical portrait of Elizabethan England. Historian Ian Mortimer, a former fellow of the Royal Historical Society, escorts the Anglophile on a tour of his native country five centuries ago, where 3s could buy you a personal tour of the Tower of London&#39;s dungeons. Disguised as a trip-planner, this lively historical account stays true to form offering readers travel advice such as fashion trends (ruffs and ruffles rule), diet tips (avoid tomatoes), and much-needed safety notes such as why bathing is unhealthy and how many arrows to keep on hand. On the topic of good manners, it is customary to remove your hat when in the presence of public urination and true gentlemen greet women with a full-on kiss on the lips, a custom that possibly explains why in 1563, over 17 thousand people succumbed to the plague. Motimer explores many facets of England&#39;s &#34;Golden Age&#34; with intricate detail yet a lightness in tone. He riffs off fellow scholars to fill the gaps in this upbeat and in depth account. Wildly entertaining, Mortimer fresh approach to history will draw in many types of readers. Agent: George Lucas, Inkwell Management.

The US and Swiss governments are about to embark on diplomatic discussions regarding the Safehaven Protocols, aimed at limiting the amount of war materials exported by Switzerland to the Nazis, stemming the tide of looted gold, and preventing postwar use of Nazi wealth by war criminals. With the talks about to begin and the Gestapo ever present, the OSS wants Billy and Kaz to protect the participants, which turns out to be a very deadly task.<br><br>The plans go wrong from the beginning when Billy and Kaz crashland in France. As they make their way through occupied territory to the border, they meet Anton Lasho, a member of the Sinti ethnic group, whose family was slaughtered by the Nazis, and who is, in turn, a one-man Nazi-killing machine. They&#x2019;ll need his help, because as they find once they make it across the border, Swiss banks are openly laundering gold &#x201c;harvested&#x201d; from concentration camps, and those who are profiting will do everything they can to protect their wealth and hide their dark secrets.</p><p>James R.

Even as tracers lit the night air, their silent silvery phosphorescence clawing at our small aircraft from the ground below, a tiny part of my brain mused on this practical demonstration of that scientific fact. The rest of my brain panicked madly, sending surges of adrenaline coursing through my body, urging me to get the hell out, now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was not at all helpful, given that we were flying at five hundred feet, heading directly into heavy antiaircraft fire, making one hundred and eighty miles per hour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the sound. The chattering of ack-ack fire. Flak exploding in blinding flashes all around us. Shrapnel struck the aircraft, rending the metal, sounding like the devil&#x2019;s own hail storm on a sheetmetal roof.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hold tight!&#x201d; shouted the pilot as he dove the Lysander and put it through twists and turns to evade the lead rising up against us. I looked below as he dipped the airplane and saw the twinkling of automatic fire from along the stretch of river we&#x2019;d been ollowing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the road,&#x201d; I shouted to the pilot in the single front seat. It was a column of German vehicles, moving at night to avoid Allied aircraft, and we&#x2019;d flown dead at them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot didn&#x2019;t waste breath answering. He banked left, violently, diving to treetop level at a right angle away from the river. Looking back, I saw tracer fire searching vainly for us, then fade as the Krauts gave up and continued on their way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lysander jolted, loud <i>thump</i>s whacking against the aircraft frame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry, chaps,&#x201d; the pilot muttered, pulling back on the yoke and gaining altitude. &#x201c;Almost landed in the pines. She&#x2019;s a bit sluggish, might&#x2019;ve caught some shrapnel in the rudder.&#x201d; He banked the Lysander, bringing us around to the river again, the only map to our destination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There may be other columns on the road,&#x201d; Kaz said, adjusting his steel-rimmed spectacles. Even after nearly being blown out of the sky and tossed around inside the cramped Lysander, he managed to sound nonchalant, his precise English leavened with the slightest of Polish accents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Sa�ne River is our only landmark,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Jerry&#x2019;s travel plans notwithstanding. If we veer off to the east, we run the risk of entering Swiss airspace. It&#x2019;d be damned embarrassing to be shot down by the Swiss, after all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Kaz asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know the Swiss. Chocolate, watches, and sheep, that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re famous for. I&#x2019;d never hear the end of it, if I lived to tell the tale.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Personally, I&#x2019;d choose death by chocolatier if I had any say in the matter,&#x201d; Kaz responded. Switzerland was our ultimate destination, and we weren&#x2019;t in the market for wristwatches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about the Swiss or the Jerries,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t lost a Joe yet, and I don&#x2019;t plan on starting tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were his Joes. It was what the Special Operations Executive pilots called the agents and commandoes they flew into occupied Europe. No names, nothing to reveal if captured and tortured, just an anonymous one-way ride to some grassy field in the countryside. In a few minutes we were back on course, flying low over dark hills and a glistening waterway, the bright half-moon at our backs providing a tempting target for alert Kraut gunners, the river our only guide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the next landmark?&#x201d; I asked the nameless pilot. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll bear left at the Rh�ne River in Lyon. There&#x2019;s a sharp bend in the river, it&#x2019;ll be easy to spot, even with only a half-moon. Then Lake Gris, a narrow lake about twelve miles long. I set us down outside of Cessens, in a nice open field on a ridge overlooking the water. A bit tricky, but very secluded.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tricky I didn&#x2019;t mind, if it meant no Krauts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We flew on, no sign of movement below us, not a single light visible in the blacked-out countryside. The drone of the engine was mesmerizing, lulling us into a sense of security and safety, the sudden, surprising bright barrage of fire now behind us. The high, clear canopy gave us a majestic view of the sparkling heavens. The&nbsp; half-moon, the stars, and the faint glow from the instrument panel our only illuminations, guiding us as we traveled across a calm sea of inky black.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost relaxed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Kaz asked, leaning forward and pointing at two o&#x2019;clock. Searchlights flickered in the distance, an orange glow growing at the horizon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bloody Bomber Command most likely,&#x201d; the pilot answered in a low growl. &#x201c;Hitting the rail yards in Lyon. Or the airfield west of the city. Either way, they&#x2019;ve stirred up a hornet&#x2019;s nest for us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can we go around it?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the fuel. We&#x2019;re at the extreme range as it is. I topped off at a forward airstrip in Normandy, but I&#x2019;ve barely enough to make it back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We must fly through that?&#x201d; Kaz asked. As we drew closer, the night sky grew brighter with searchlights, explosions, and burning buildings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Unless you Joes want to abort the mission. Say the word and I&#x2019;ll turn around.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have you ever had to abort?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No. Thought I&#x2019;d offer, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; he said, turning to smile at us. SOE pilot humor, I guess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as bad as it looks, mates. We&#x2019;re under their radar, and the Jerries are looking for high-altitude bombers, not our little Lysander.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fly under the bomber formation,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;Being hit by an RAF bomb would be more embarrassing than being shot down by the Swiss.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right you are,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Now all we need to do is catch a glimpse of the Rh�ne River. It&#x2019;ll be even easier with the sky all lit up. Jerry&#x2019;s doing us a favor!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was one way of looking at it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drew closer to the city, the searchlights casting wide beams of white light, looking like columns holding up the night sky. Phosphorescent tracer bullets sought out the bombers, dancing against the darkness in graceful, deadly arcs. Bombs exploded in front of us, maybe a quarter of a mile away. The pilot banked the Lysander, moving away rom the flames and smoke. The aircraft shook as shock waves from the explosions buffeted us, sending the plane into a sideways dive. The ground looked damned close.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hang on,&#x201d; the pilot told us, as if we hadn&#x2019;t already figured that one out. He pulled the small craft up, his voice a nervous quiver he couldn&#x2019;t quite hide. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the main rail yard. We should be fine now. Look, there&#x2019;s the river.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Rh�ne, heading west from the burning city, shimmering with moonlight and mayhem, antiaircraft fire dying down as the bomber stream departed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is the airplane damaged?&#x201d; Kaz asked. There was a metallic rattle coming from the fuselage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s banged up,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;But I can hold her steady, don&#x2019;t worry. The good news is I can cut some time off our trip and make sure you chaps get to Cessens. The Rh�ne meanders a good bit, so I&#x2019;ll cut across the bends heading ninety degrees west. That&#x2019;ll bring us to Lake Gris all the quicker.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the bad news?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It will bring us close to a Luftwaffe airfield. Sounds worse than it is, really. Any night fighters they have left will be airborne, going after the bombers. We&#x2019;ll scoot right by. You should be on the ground in thirty minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So the airfield poses no danger?&#x201d; Kaz asked, his tone skeptical.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right. Long as one of the flak batteries doesn&#x2019;t open up on us. So, once again, hang on.&#x201d; He increased speed and lost altitude, skimming the treetops until we found ourselves over open fields. It felt as if he were going in for a landing at two hundred miles an hour. The rattle clanged even faster, the fuselage shuddering as we raced for the next bend in the river.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Airfield coming up on the right,&#x201d; the pilot informed us through clenched teeth as he held the yoke firmly in his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There,&#x201d; Kaz said, pointing to black shapes that were probably hangers. The landscape zipped by underneath us, and we were nearly clear, about to leave the blacked-out airfield behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the sky lit up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Searchlights, some only a few hundred yards away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright explosions ripped into the blackness ahead, followed by a series of blasts falling across our path. I lifted my hands to shield my eyes as one of the beams caught us, sending blinding white light into the canopy. More explosions sounded as the pilot climbed, seeking to escape the clutches of the searchlight and the antiaircraft fire it would soon bring to bear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concussions from the bombs hit us, shaking the Lysander, dragging it through the sky as if it were a kite on a string. We&#x2019;d guessed wrong. The bombers were targeting both the rail yards and the airfield.<br>We&#x2019;d flown straight into the second raid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light found us again, staying with the Lysander even as the pilot gave up on altitude and put the nose down, hoping to shake the flak. Tracers burned the night sky, hitting us in the wing, shearing metal, and sending us into a spin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The searchlight lost us. I grabbed onto my seat and Kaz&#x2019;s arm, hoping the pilot could steady the aircraft. I braced for impact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn&#x2019;t come. The sturdy Lysander managed to fly straight, so low we could&#x2019;ve been hit by a well-thrown stone. I craned my neck to see behind us, the orange glow of flames and the white searchlights fading in the distance. Wind whistled through a bullet hole in the canopy, the clanging rattle of metal still sounding from within the fuselage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The aircraft is damaged,&#x201d; Kaz said, as calmly as he might observe that it may well rain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll get you there, don&#x2019;t you worry,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;Although getting me back home is another thing altogether.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You are welcome to join us, if you wish,&#x201d; Kaz said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in the cards, Joe. The Germans would love to get their hands on a Lysander. I&#x2019;ll stay with the plane until you&#x2019;re safely away and then put the torch to her. Maybe I&#x2019;ll get lucky and spend the rest of the war learning French from a farmer&#x2019;s daughter, if Jerry doesn&#x2019;t catch me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. I felt bad for him, but at the same time I was glad he didn&#x2019;t take Kaz up on the invite. Things would be tough enough without an extra man along. If he was lucky, our Resistance contacts would leave somebody with him. But we had places to go, and fast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est la guerre,&#x201d; </i>he answered, the yoke vibrating violently in his<br>hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A harsh knock came from the engine, followed by a metal-onmetal grating. The propeller stopped. Oil sprayed the windscreen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh shit,&#x201d; the pilot said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lysander dropped from the sky.</p><h2>The Return of the Shadow: The History of the Lord of the Rings, The History of Middle-Earth, Part 1, Vol. 6</h2><p>In this sixth volume of The History of Middle-earth the story reaches The Lord of the Rings. In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes, with full citation of the earliest notes, outline plans, and narrative drafts, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits, Frodo's companions, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard, in league with the Enemy, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot.<br><br>The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time, as the Company of the Ring, still lacking Legolas and Gimli, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria. The Return of the Shadow is illustrated with reproductions of the first maps and notable pages from the earliest manuscripts.<br></p><p>J.R.R. Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892. After serving in the First World War, he embarked upon a distinguished career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. He is the renowned creator of Middle-earth and author of the great modern classic, The Hobbit, the prelude to his epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings. Other works by J.R.R. Tolkien include The Silmarillion. J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973 at the age of 81. <p>Christopher Tolkien, who formerly taught at Oxford University, is J.R.R. Tolkien's son and literary executor. The editor of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales as well as the twelve-part series The History of Middle-earth, he lives in France.</p>Collectively, these volumes are marketed as "The History of The Lord of the Rings" and tell alternate stories of the siege of Middle-earth and Sauron's defeat. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Myth and Reality</h2><p>An informative guide to the modern mythologies! This classic study, translated from the original French, deals primarily with societies around the world in which myth is--or was until very recently-- &#34;living,&#34; in the sense that it supplies models for human behavior and, by that very fact, gives meaning and value to life. The author believes that understanding the structure and function of myths in these traditional societies serves to clarify a stage in the history of human thought: &#34;myths reveal that the World, man, and life have a supernatural origin and history, and that this history is significant, precious, and exemplary.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Smith of Wootton Major &amp; Farmer Giles of Ham</h2><p>What began as a preface to The Golden Key by George MacDonald eventually grew into this charming short story, so named by Tolkien to suggest an early work by P.G. Wodehouse. Composed almost a decade after The Lord of the Rings, and when his lifelong occupation with the &#39;Silmarillion&#39; was winding down, Smith of Wootton Major was the product of ripened experience and reflection. It was published in 1967 as a small hardback, complete with charming black and white illustrations by Pauline Baynes, and would be the last work of fiction to be published in Tolkien&#39;s own lifetime.</p><p>J.R.R.Tolkien (1892-1973) was a distinguished academic, though he is best known for writing The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, plus other stories and essays.

In this major reevaluation of that crucial year, Robert Citino shows that the German army&#39;s emerging woes were rooted as much in its addiction to the &#34;war of movement&#34;-attempts to smash the enemy in &#34;short and lively&#34; campaigns-as they were in Hitler&#39;s deeply flawed management of the war. From the overwhelming operational victories at Kerch and Kharkov in May to the catastrophic defeats at El Alamein and Stalingrad, Death of the Wehrmacht offers an eye-opening new view of that decisive year. Building upon his widely respected critique in The German Way of War, Citino shows how the campaigns of 1942 fit within the centuries-old patterns of Prussian/German warmaking and ultimately doomed Hitler&#39;s expansionist ambitions. He examines every major campaign and battle in the Russian and North African theaters throughout the year to assess how a military geared to quick and decisive victories coped when the tide turned against it. Citino also reconstructs the German generals&#39; view of the war and illuminates the multiple contingencies that might have produced more favorable results. In addition, he cites the fatal extreme aggressiveness of German commanders like Erwin Rommel and assesses how the German system of command and its commitment to the &#34;independence of subordinate commanders&#34; suffered under the thumb of Hitler and chief of staff General Franz Halder. More than the turning point of a war, 1942 marked the death of a very old and traditional pattern of warmaking, with the classic &#34;German way of war&#34; unable to meet the challenges of the twentieth century. Blending masterly research with a gripping narrative, Citino&#39;s remarkable work provides a fresh and revealing look at how one of history&#39;s most powerful armies began to founder in its quest for world domination.</p><p>"A winner across the board by one of the masters of operational history. The capstone to a four-volume study on modern mobile warfare, it solidifies Citino's position among the very best scholars who have written on the 'German way of war.' In particular, his treatment of the 1942 Russian campaigns is fully level with the best of David Glantz's work from the Soviet perspective and restores both Stalingrad and El Alamein to their rightful status as major turning points in the war."--Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Patton and Rommel</i><p> </p><p>"There is no better examination of German operations during the crisis year of 1942."--Geoffrey P. Megargee, author of <i>Inside Hitler's High Command</i></p>Robert M. Citino is professor of European history at Eastern Michigan University and author of seven other books, including most recently <i>The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich</i>.</p><h2>Cook&#39;s Country Eats Local: 150 Regional Recipes You Should Be Making No Matter Where You Live</h2><p><p><b>150 Regional Recipes You Should Be Making No Matter Where You Live</b></p><p>From Maine&#x2019;s hearty Joe Booker Stew to pineapple-packed Hawaiian Fried Rice, this collection of recipes brings bold local flavors and tried-and-true cooking techniques home&#x2014;no matter where that may be.

In 1999, as a complete unknown, he took the lead of the Western States Endurance Run, a 100-mile traverse over the old Gold Rush trails of the California Sierra Nevada. He won that race seven years in a row, setting a course record along the way. Twice he won the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile jaunt through Death Valley. He triumphed in the 153-mile Spartathlon in Greece three times. And he was one of the elite runners who traveled to Mexico to run with the Tarahumara Indians, as profiled in the runaway bestseller Born to Run. His accomplishments are nothing short of extraordinary, but that he has achieved all of this on a plant-based diet makes his story all the more so.In Eat and Run, Scott Jurek opens up about his life and career as an elite athlete and a vegan and inspires runners at every level. From</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: While many of us sit behind a desk for eight or nine hours a day, Scott Jurek is running. A legend among hard-core runners, Jurek has fashioned a lucrative career as an ultramarathoner. He runs, and wins, grueling races in excess of 100 miles, in a wide array of usually inhospitable environments: Death Valley, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Mexico&#x2019;s Copper Canyon. And he does it on a completely plant-based diet. In <em>Eat and Run</em>, Jurek tells the story of how an average Midwestern kid growing up on meat he caught or killed himself became a vegan elite athlete. Part memoir, part training guide, part vegan manifesto, Jurek&#x2019;s most inspiring proposal here is that running&#x2014;like so many things in life&#x2014;is less dependent on physical skill than it is on willpower. Runners of all levels, meat-eaters, and vegans alike will be inspired to lace up their sneaks and hit the trails. --<em>Juliet Disparte</em> <p></p> <strong>Photographs from <em>Eat and Run</em></strong> <p><strong>Click on thumbnails for larger images</strong></p> <strong></strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The Tarahumara were known for their grace and speed.

Ezekiel Proctor and Ned Christie are the last Cherokee warriors, men of legend and history, whose fates are a consequence of such brutal policies as the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the infamous Trail of Tears. They struggle to find honor in a harsh, violent land under the relentless pressure of white law and broken promises. Every bit as tough as their men, the women in <i>Zeke and Ned</i> are determined to raise their families and keep the two men alive--whatever it takes.Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

He portrays virtues to be emulated and vices to be avoided, but his purpose is also implicitly to educate and warn those in his own day who wielded power. In prose that is rich, elegant and sprinkled with learned references, he explores with an extraordinary degree of insight the interplay of character and political action. While drawing chiefly on historical sources, he brings to biography a natural story-teller's ear for a good anecdote. Throughout the ages Plutarch's <em>Lives</em> have been valued for their historical value and their charm. This new translation will introduce new generations to his urbane erudition.

But how did America become "one nation, indivisible"? In this monumental history, Simon Winchester addresses these questions, bringing together the breathtaking achievements of those American pioneers who helped to forge and unify the new nation, and who toiled fearlessly to bond the citizens and geography of the United States from its very beginnings. This sweeping narrative details how these daring men, some famous, some forgotten, left their mark on America's natural landscapes, through courage, ingenuity, and hard work.</p><p>Winchester follows the footsteps of America's most crucial innovators, thinkers, and explorers, from Lewis and Clark and the leaders of the Great Surveys of the West to the builders of the first transcontinental railroad and the curmudgeonly civil engineer who oversaw the creation of more than three million miles of highway. Winchester travels across vast swaths of the American landscape, from Pittsburgh to Portland, Seattle to Anchorage, Truckee to Laramie, using the five classical elements&#x2014;Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal&#x2014;to chart the contributions these adventurous leaders made to connect the diverse communities within the United States and ensure the future of the American project begun in 1776.</p><p><em>The Men Who United the States</em> is an unforgettable journey of unprecedented scope across time and open spaces, providing a new lens through which to view American history, led by one of our most gifted writers.</p><p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists. In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen.

"[T]here's nothing for me to do, nowhere I'd care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing." This bored, <i>bored</i> young protagonist who can't see the point to anything is knocked out of his glum humdrum by the sudden and curious appearance of a tollbooth in his bedroom. Since Milo has absolutely nothing better to do, he dusts off his toy car, pays the toll, and drives through. What ensues is a journey of mythic proportions, during which Milo encounters countless odd characters who are anything but dull.<p> Norton Juster received (and continues to receive) enormous praise for this original, witty, and oftentimes hilarious novel, first published in 1961. In an introductory "Appreciation" written by Maurice Sendak for the 35th anniversary edition, he states, "<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> leaps, soars, and abounds in right notes all over the place, as any proper masterpiece must." Indeed.</p><p> As Milo heads toward Dictionopolis he meets with the Whether Man ("for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be"), passes through The Doldrums (populated by Lethargarians), and picks up a watchdog named Tock (who has a giant alarm clock for a body). The brilliant satire and double entendre intensifies in the Word Market, where after a brief scuffle with Officer Short Shrift, Milo and Tock set off toward the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the twin Princesses, Rhyme and Reason. Anyone with an appreciation for language, irony, or <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>-style adventure will adore this book for years on end. <i>(Ages 8 and up)</i></p>For Milo, everything&#39;s a bore. When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he&#39;s got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a tick watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason! Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it&#39;s exciting beyond his wildest dreams!</p><h2>Condensed Chaos: An Introduction to Chaos Magic</h2><p>Magic is a doorway through which we step into mystery, wildness, and immanence. We live in a world subject to extensive and seemingly, all-embracing systems of social and personal control that continually feed us the lie that we are each alone, helpless, and powerless to effect change. Magic is about change. Changing your circumstances so that you strive to live according to a developing sense of personal responsibility; that you can effect change around you if you choose; that we are not helpless cogs in some clockwork universe. All acts of personal/collective liberation are magical acts. Magic leads us into exhilaration and ecstasy; into insight and understanding; into changing ourselves and the world in which we participate. Through magic we may come to explore the possibilities of freedom.</p><p>Phil Hine is a former editor of the internationally acclaimed magazine Chaos International. He divides his time among doing magic, recovering and then writing about it afterwards. He has facilitated workshops and seminars on modern magical practice in America and Europe. He is the author of Prime Chaos, The Pseudonomicon, and Chaos Servitors: A Users Guide. He lives in London, England."Most modern books on magic are not worth reading.

She&#39;s hoping someone there will have word of her lost sister Speaking Rain. Meanwhile, her oldest sister Brown Deer will soon be married to Cut Cheek, and Kaya is worried, is she about to lose her other sister, too?</p><p>Each night when Janet Shaw was a girl, she took out a flashlight and book hidden under her pillow and read until she fell asleep. She and her brother liked to act out stories, especially ones about sword fights and wild horses. Today, Ms. Shaw has three grown children. When they were small, she often pulled them in a big red wagon to the library, where they filled the wagon with so many books, they had to walk back home. Ms. Shaw now lives in North Carolina with her husband and their dog.Reviewed with Janet Shaw's <i>Kaya's Escape!</i> <p>Gr. 3-5. In 1764, nine-year-old Kaya lives in the traditional homeland of the Nez Perce tribe (present-day Idaho, Washington, and Oregon) with her parents, siblings, and Speaking Rain, a blind girl. In <i>Meet Kaya</i>, she neglects her duties and, when the other children find out, she wonders if she will ever live it down. In <i>Kaya's Escape</i>, Kaya and Speaking Rain are captured and taken to an enemy's camp. Determined to escape, Kaya struggles to make it home through the bitter winter weather without supplies. Nez Perce words are used throughout both stories, and a glossary is appended. A closing section in both titles provides cultural and historical information as well as pictures of the Nimiipuu, known today as the Nez Perce. The editorial staff of Pleasant Company worked with the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Council to create an advisory board that supervised all aspects of the project, including the decision to set the story before contact with white explorers and settlers. Both historically accurate and culturally sensitive, Kaya's stories are welcome additions to this publisher's output and a noteworthy result of a unique collaboration. <i>Karen Hutt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A comprehensive compilation of his work on dreams, this popular book is without parallel. Skilfully weaving a narrative that encompasses all of his major themes - mysticism, religion, culture and symbolism - Jung brings a wealth of allusion to the collection. He identifies such issues as the filmic quality of some dreams, and the differences between 'personal dreams' - dreams that exist on the individual level - and 'big dreams' - dreams that we <em>all</em> experience, that come from the collective unconscious. <em>Dreams</em> provides the perfect introduction to his concepts to those unfamiliar with Jung's work.

You stand in awe before his knowledge of the archaic and his knowledge of the modern. Even more, you stand in awe of the connections he can make between the archaic and the modern; he makes the remote familiar and the familiar fundamental." -- <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> <p>"As a critic, Davenport shines as an intrepid appreciator, an ideal teacher. By preference, he likes to walk the reader through a painting or a poem, teasing out the meaning of odd details, making connections with history and other works of art. His must-have essay collections, <i>The Geography of the Imagination</i> and <i>Every Force Evolves a Form</i>, displays his range: With a rainwater clarity, he can write about the naturalistic Louis Aggassiz or ancient poetry and thought . . . He can account for the importance of prehistoric cave art to early modernism or outline the achievements of Joyce and Pound. He can make you yearn to read or look again at neglected masters like the poets Charles Olson and Louis Zukofsky and the painters Balthus and Charles Burchfield. He can send you out eagerly searching for C. M. Doughty's six-volume epic poem, <i>The Dawn in Britain</i>, and for the works of Ronald Johnson, Jonathan Williams and Paul Metcalf. In all this, his method is nothing other than the deep attentiveness engendered by love; that and a firm faith in simply knowing things. He conveys, to adopt his own words about painter Paul Cadmus, 'a perfect balance of spirit and information.'" -- <b>Michael Dirda</b>, <i>Washington Post Book World</i> </p><p>"One of our most gifted and versatile men of letters." -- <i>New York Times</i> </p><p>"In these forty essays, spanning the length of a distinguished career, one of America's major literary critics elucidates and astonishing range of literary history with both wit and wisdom.

More than 400 men--and 21 tons of gold--were lost. In the 1980s, a maverick engineer named Tommy Thompson set out to find the wreck and salvage its treasure from the ocean floor. <br><br>With knuckle-biting suspense, Gary Kinder reconstructs the terror of the <i>Central America</i>'s last days, when passengers bailed freezing water from the hold, then chopped the ship's timbers to use as impromptu liferafts. He goes on to chronicle Thompson's epic quest for the lost vessel, an endeavor that drew on the latest strides in oceanography, information theory, and underwater robotics, and that pitted Thompson against hair-raising weather, bloodthirsty sharks, and unscrupulous rivals. <br><br><b>Ship of Gold</b> is a magnificent adventure, filled with heroism, ingenuity, and perseverance.</p><p>The facts speak for themselves. In 1857, the <i>Central America</i>, a sidewheel steamer ferrying passengers fresh from the gold rush of California to New York and laden with 21 tons of California gold, encountered a severe storm off the Carolina coast and sank, carrying more than 400 passengers and all her cargo down with her. She then sat for 132 years, 200 miles offshore and almost two miles below the ocean's surface--a depth at which she was assumed to be unrecoverable--until 1989, when a deep-water research vessel sailed into the harbor at Norfolk, Virginia, fat with salvaged gold coins and bullion estimated to be worth one billion dollars. <p> Author Gary Kinder wisely lets the story of the Columbus-America Discovery Group, led by maverick scientist and entrepreneur Tommy Thompson, unfold without hyperbole. Kinder interweaves the tale of the <i>Central America</i> and her passengers and crew with Thompson's own story of growing up landlocked in Ohio, an irrepressible tinkerer and explorer even in his childhood days, and his progress to adulthood as a young man who always had "7 to 14" projects on the table or spinning in his head at any given moment. One of those projects would become the preposterous recovery of the stricken steamer, and the resourcefulness and later urgency with which the project would proceed is contrasted poignantly with the <i>Central America</i>'s doomed battle in 1857 to stay afloat. </p><p> Thompson, who spent nearly a decade planning and organizing his recovery effort, emerges as one of the great unsung adventurers of these times (the technical innovations alone required for such a task produced a windfall for the scientific community and defined a new state of the art for deep-sea explorers and treasure hunters), and the story of the steamer's sinking is compelling enough to make any reader wonder why the <i>Central America</i> sinking isn't synonymous with <i>shipwreck</i> in this <i>Titanic</i>-happy age. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>"The truly fascinating tale of the first successful deep-water ocean salvage operation is a tribute to good, old-fashioned American ingenuity and grit - with a big does of Titanic-like adventure to book.<p>Kinder's well-told tale of the Central America recovery . . . is one of the great scientific adventure stories of our time."<br>--<i>Kirkus</i></p></p><h2>Secrets of a Jewish Baker: Authentic Jewish Rye and Other Breads</h2><p>For more than twenty years, George Greenstein owned and operated a Long Island bakery that produced all sorts of baked goods, from all sorts of ethnic traditions&#x2014;focaccia and Irish soda bread, Bavarian pumpernickel and naan&#x2014;including many from his own culture, such as Jewish corn bread, challah, and bagels.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p>Who could want anything more from a Heinlein novel than time-travel, intrigue, danger, hasty marriages, murder, playful sexual banter, and a kitten named Pixel who has the extraordinary ability to walk through walls? While he probably can't walk through walls, narrator Tom Weiner's extraordinary ability is to take the dozens of distinct characters in Heinlein's philosophical space adventure and give each a unique and instantly recognizable style. Weiner's performance is particularly strong with the two main characters, Colin Campbell (aka Richard Ames) and Hazel Stone (aka Gwen Novak). Weiner gives Colin/Richard's first-person narrative a charming, softly sarcastic growl and Hazel/Gwen's voice a lovely globe-and-time-trotting sophistication. Spoken by Weiner, their banter becomes clever enough to challenge even Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert to a literary duel. A.A.

Celebrating all that makes us unique and different, Skin Again offers new ways to talk about race and identity. Race matters, but only so much-what&#39;s most important is who we are on the inside. Looking beyond skin, going straight to the heart, we find in each other the treasures stored down deep. Learning to cherish those treasures, to be all we imagine ourselves to be, makes us free. Skin Again celebrates this freedom.</p><p>Chris Raschka's Hyperion titles include<i>Happy to Be Nappy, little tree, Be Boy Buzz,</i>and<i>Skin Again.</i>HBFC has also published his<i>Thingy Things</i>series, which includes<i>Moosey Moose, Whaley Whale, Sluggy Slug,</i>and<i>Doggy Dog.

This time the subject is skin, both what it is and, more importantly, what it is not. "The skin I'm in/is just a covering./If you want to know who I am/you have got to come inside/and open your heart way wide." While the message comes across loud and clear, the author's deft handling of language renders it gently persuasive rather than didactic. Raschka's impressionistic pictures amplify the theme as they shift from large, bold cartoons showing the outside of both white and black children, and then move to the inner patchwork of thoughts and feelings that make up "real" individuals. The illustrations will invite lengthy study, as Raschka shows the children passing through the various boxes as they reach inside to know each other and then come outside to see skin again with fresh eyes. Whether shared with a group or one-on-one, this is an excellent vehicle to initiate discussion on a sensitive and perennially important subject.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To inspire a quiet revolution in the whole way we look at death and care for the dying and the whole way we look at life, and care for the living&#39; Written by Buddhist meditation master and popular international speaker Soygal Rinpoche, this highly acclaimed book clarifies the majestic vision of life and death that underlies the Tibetan tradition. It includes not only a lucid, inspiring and complete introduction to the practice of meditation but also advice on how to care for the dying with love and compassion, and how to bring them help of a spiritual kind. But there is much more besides in this classic work, which was written to inspire all who read it to begin the journey to enlightenment and so become &#39;servants of peace&#39; working in the world.</p><p>In 1927, Walter Evans-Wentz published his translation of an obscure Tibetan Nyingma text and called it the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>. Popular Tibetan teacher Sogyal Rinpoche has transformed that ancient text, conveying a perennial philosophy that is at once religious, scientific, and practical. Through extraordinary anecdotes and stories from religious traditions East and West, Rinpoche introduces the reader to the fundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism, moving gradually to the topics of death and dying. Death turns out to be less of a crisis and more of an opportunity. Concepts such as reincarnation, karma, and bardo and practices such as meditation, tonglen, and phowa teach us how to face death constructively. As a result, life becomes much richer. Like Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Sogyal Rinpoche opens the door to a full experience of death. It is up to the reader to walk through. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p>"What is it I hope for from this book?

Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>&#34;The old clich� that Henry James wrote novels as though they were philosophical treatises whereas William James wrote philosophical treatises as though they were novels, while unfair to Henry, describes William, including the William James of Varieties of Religious Experience, very well. Believers and unbelievers (and semibelievers) will continue to find in it both a resource and a challenge. Quaint though some of it may seem at first in language and approach, The Varieties of Religious Experience can itself become for the contemporary reader not only an intellectual exercise and an aesthetic treat but a religious experience.&#34; --Jaroslav Pelikan</p><h2>The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Reader&#39;s Digest)</h2><p>Three years have passed since Sherlock Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty vanished into the abyss of the Reichenbach falls.

In this landmark work, DeSalvo uses her twenty years as a teacher of writing to explore how the creative process can in fact be a restorative tool. She looks at the cutting-edge scientific research on the subject and presents dozens of anecdotes of famous writers and beginners in the field to illuminate her theory that writing can repair pain--and keep our demons at bay. <p> In <em> Writing as a Way of Healing,</em> DeSalvo also develops a detailed program of exercises that shows writers and nonwriters alike how to "open up" to themselves through writing, write regularly in a relaxed way, and achieve a state of personal acceptance through writing. DeSalvo's techniques will provide a solid foundation for writers to benefit both physically and emotionally from telling their stories. </p><p> DeSalvo writes with remarkable insight of a wide range of writers who have found that their work helped them to heal, including Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Kenzaburo Oe, Djuna Barnes, Peter Handke, Jamaica Kincaid, and Mark Doty. In these pages, we become familiar with writers' stories of healing: Isabel Allende deals with the anguish of sitting near her comatose daughter's bedside by beginning to compose a letter to her that eventually becomes the memoir <em>Paula.</em> Henry Miller, despondent when his wife, June, left him for another woman and contemplating suicide, instead works through the night on a story that details his life with June. This brief outline, written during a time of Miller's sharpest despair, serves as the inspiration for his greatest novels.</p><p> DeSalvo illustrates how writers can find solace in their work if they ensure that they have a safe environment and a deliberate plan to approach the writing process. She also discusses what went wrong for writers "at risk" like Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath, and she warns of the danger of using writing as a call for help instead of seeking help. According to DeSalvo, the way to responsibly write, to heal, is to make an effort to understand our experiences as we write about them. The healing power comes from the reflection on the pain we are living through. </p><p> In this inspiring book, highly acclaimed author and teacher Louise DeSalvo reveals the healing power of writing. Based on her twenty years of research, DeSalvo show how anyone can use writing as a way to heal the emotional and physical wounds that are an inevitable part of life. She draws on the journals, diaries, letters, and works of dozens of famous writers and students of the craft to illustrate how people "change physically and psychologically when they work on projects that grow from a deep, authentic place." With insight and wit, she illuminates how writers, from Virginia Woolf to Henry Miller to Audre Lorde to Isabel Allende, have been transformed by the wiring process. <em>Writing as a Way of Healing</em> includes valuable advice and practical techniques to guide and inspire both experienced and beginning writers.</p><p></p></p><p>Louise DeSalvo, Ph.D., is the author of the literary study <em> Conceived with Malice: Literature as Revenge, Vertigo: A Memoir,</em> and the widely praised <em> Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work.</em> A frequent lecturer and guest on radio (including NPR) and television, DeSalvo is a professor of English and creative writing at Hunter College in New York and has been profiled in the <em>New York Times</em> for her innovative teaching techniques.How writing can be used to recover from trauma and as a tool for personal growth: encouragement and suggestions from a professor of literature and creative writing. DeSalvo (Hunter Coll.) is working here from her own experience: a tumultuous childhood, the loss of her mother and sister in adulthood, and severe health problems left her in turmoil that began to calm when she wrote about her experiences (Vertigo: A Memoir, 1996). Years of seeing her students find similar succor has further convinced her of the special value writing holds as a therapeutic tool. It's cheap, doesn't take much time, is self-initiated and flexible, can be private (or public), is easily portable, can be done in sickness or in health; ``writing to heal requires no innate talent, though we become more skilled as we write, especially when we pay careful attention to the process.'' DeSalvo is careful to caution throughout, howeever, that writing mustn't become a substitute for medical care. DeSalvo refers extensively to James W. Pennebaker's Opening Up; he and colleagues studied in depth the relationship between writing about difficult feelings and improving health, and then specifically what kind of writing led to healing after traumatic experiences. DeSalvo especially cites Virginia Woolf, Isabel Allende, and Alice Walker as practitioners of therapeutic writing. She argues strongly that writing ``is a very sturdy ladder out of the Pit to reach freedom and safety.'' Her guide is a reasonable starting point for those who hope shes right. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For in Fitz&#39;s blood runs the magic Skill--and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom.</p><h2>Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire&#39;s Slaves</h2><p>From the author of the prize-winning King Leopold's Ghost comes a taut, thrilling account of the first grass-roots human rights campaign, which freed hundreds of thousands of slaves around the world.<br>In 1787, twelve men gathered in a London printing shop to pursue a seemingly impossible goal: ending slavery in the largest empire on earth. Along the way, they would pioneer most of the tools citizen activists still rely on today, from wall posters and mass mailings to boycotts and lapel pins. This talented group combined a hatred of injustice with uncanny skill in promoting their cause. Within five years, more than 300,000 Britons were refusing to eat the chief slave-grown product, sugar; London's smart set was sporting antislavery badges created by Josiah Wedgwood; and the House of Commons had passed the first law banning the slave trade.<br>However, the House of Lords, where slavery backers were more powerful, voted down the bill. But the crusade refused to die, fueled by remarkable figures like Olaudah Equiano, a brilliant ex-slave who enthralled audiences throughout the British Isles; John Newton, the former slave ship captain who wrote "Amazing Grace"; Granville Sharp, an eccentric musician and self-taught lawyer; and Thomas Clarkson, a fiery organizer who repeatedly crisscrossed Britain on horseback, devoting his life to the cause. He and his fellow activists brought slavery in the British Empire to an end in the 1830s, long before it died in the United States. The only survivor of the printing shop meeting half a century earlier, Clarkson lived to see the day when a slave whip and chains were formally buried in a Jamaican churchyard.<br>Like Hochschild's classic King Leopold's Ghost, Bury the Chains abounds in atmosphere, high drama, and nuanced portraits of unsung heroes and colorful villains. Again Hochschild gives a little-celebrated historical watershed its due at last.</p><p>Adam Hochschild was born in New York City in 1942. His first book, Half the Way Home: a Memoir of Father and Son, was published in 1986. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called it "an extraordinarily moving portrait of the complexities and confusions of familial love . . . firmly grounded in the specifics of a particular time and place, conjuring them up with Proustian detail and affection." It was followed by The Mirror at Midnight: a South African Journey, and The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin. His 1997 collection, Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels, won the PEN/Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award for the Art of the Essay. King Leopold's Ghost: a Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa was a finalist for the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award. It also won a J. Anthony Lukas award in the United States, and the Duff Cooper Prize in England. His books have been translated into twelve languages and four of them have been named Notable Books of the Year by The New York Times Book Review. His Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire&#x2019;s Slaves, was a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award in Nonfiction and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History. His last two books have also each won Canada&#x2019;s Lionel Gelber Prize for the best book on international affairs and the Gold Medal of the California Book Awards. In 2005, he received a Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction.<br><br> Hochschild has written for The New Yorker, Harper's, The New York Review of Books, Granta, The New York Times Magazine, and many other newspapers and magazines. His articles have won prizes from the Overseas Press Club, the Society of Professional Journalists and elsewhere. He was a co-founder of Mother Jones magazine and has been a commentator on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered."<br><br> Hochschild teaches narrative writing at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, and spent half a year as a Fulbright Lecturer in India. He lives in San Francisco with his wife, sociologist and author Arlie Russell Hochschild. They have two sons and two granddaughters.INTRODUCTION: TWELVE MEN IN A PRINTING SHOP<br><br>Strangely, in a city where it seems that on almost every block a famous event or resident is commemorated by a blue and white glazed plaque, none marks this spot. All you can see today, after you leave the Bank station of the London Underground, walk several blocks, and then take a few steps into a courtyard, are a few low, nondescript office buildings, an ancient pub, and, on the site itself, 2 George Yard, a glass and steel high-rise. Nothing remains of the bookstore and printing shop that once stood here, or recalls the spring day more than two hundred years ago when a dozen people a somber- looking crew, most of them not removing their high-crowned black hats filed through its door and sat down for a meeting. Cities build monuments to kings, prime ministers, and generals, not to citizens with no official position who once gathered in a printing shop. Yet what these citizens began rippled across the world and we feel its aftereffects still. It is no wonder that they won the admiration of the first and greatest student of what we now call civil society. The result of the series of events begun that afternoon in London, wrote Alexis de Tocqueville, was absolutely without precedent. . . . If you pore over the histories of all peoples, I doubt that you will find anything more extraordinary.&#x201d; To understand how momentous was this beginning, we must picture a world in which the vast majority of people are prisoners. Most of them have known no other way of life. They are not free to live or go where they want. They plant, cultivate, and harvest most of the earth&#x2019;s major crops. They earn no money from their labor. Their work often lasts twelve or fourteen hours a day. Many are subject to cruel whippings or other punishments if they do not work hard enough. They die young. They are not chained or bound most of the time, but they are in bondage, part of a global economy based on forced labor. Such a world would, of course, be unthinkable today.<br> But this was the world our world just two centuries ago, and to most people then, it was unthinkable that it could ever be otherwise. At the end of the eighteenth century, well over three quarters of all people alive were in bondage of one kind or another, not the captivity of striped prison uniforms, but of various systems of slavery or serfdom. The age was a high point in the trade in which close to eighty thousand chained and shackled Africans were loaded onto slave ships and transported to the New World each year. In parts of the Americas, slaves far outnumbered free persons. The same was true in parts of Africa, and it was from these millions of indigenous slaves that African chiefs and slave dealers drew most of the men and women they sold to Europeans and Arabs sailing their ships along the continent&#x2019;s coasts. African slaves were spread throughout the Islamic world, and the Ottoman Empire enslaved other peoples as well. In India and other parts of Asia, tens of millions of farmworkers were in outright slavery, and others were peasants in debt bondage that tied them and their labor to a particular landlord as harshly as any slave was bound to a plantation owner in South Carolina or Georgia. Native Americans turned prisoners of war into slaves and sold them, both to neighboring tribes and to the Europeans now pushing their way across the continent. In Russia the majority of the population were serfs, often bought, sold, whipped, or sent to the army at the will of their owners.<br> The era was one when, as the historian Seymour Drescher puts it, freedom, not slavery, was the peculiar institution.&#x201d; This world of bondage seemed all the more normal then, because anyone looking back in time would have seen little but other slave systems. The ancient Greeks had slaves; the Romans had an estimated two to three million of them in Italy alone; the Incas and Aztecs had slaves; the sacred texts of most major religions took slavery for granted. Slavery had existed before money or written law.<br> One measure of how much slavery pervaded the world of the eighteenth century is the traffic on the Atlantic Ocean. We usually think of the Atlantic of this period as being filled with shiploads of hopeful white immigrants. But they were only a minority of those carried to the New World. So rapidly were slaves worked to death, above all on the brutal sugar plantations of the Caribbean, that between 1660 and 1807, ships brought well over three times as many Africans across the ocean to British colonies as they did Europeans. And, of course, it was not just to British territories that slaves were sent. From Senegal to Virginia, Sierra Leone to Charleston, the Niger delta to Cuba, Angola to Braziil, and on dozens upon dozens of crisscrossing paths taken by thousands of vessels, the Atlantic was a conveyor belt to early deathhhhh in the fields of an immense swath of plantations that stretched from Baltimore to Rio de Janeiro and beyond.<br> Looking back today, what is even more astonishing than the pervasiveness of slavery in the late 1700s is how swiftly it died. By the end of the following century, slavery was, at least on paper, outlawed almost everywhere. The antislavery movement had achieved its goal in little more than one lifetime.<br> This is the story of the first, pioneering wave of that campaign. Every American schoolchild learns how slaves fled Southern plantations, following the North Star on the Underground Railroad. But England is where the story really begins, and for decades it was where American abolitionists looked for inspiration and finally for proof that the colossally difficult task of uprooting slavery could be accomplished. If we were to fix one point when the crusade began, it would be the late afternoon of May 22, 1787, when twelve determined men sat down in the printing shop at 2 George Yard, amid flatbed presses, wooden trays of type, and large sheets of freshly printed book pages, to begin one of the most ambitious and brilliantly organized citizens&#x2019; movements of all time.<br> A long chain of events, large and small, led to that meeting. Perhaps the most crucial moment came when Thomas Clarkson, a twenty- five-year-old Englishman on his way to London, paused, dismounted from his horse, and sat down at the roadside, lost in thought. Many months later, he would be the principal organizer of the gathering at George Yard. Red-haired, dressed in black, he was the youngest of those who entered the shop that day, perhaps ducking his head slightly as he came through the doorway, for he was a full six inches taller than the average Englishman of his time. In the years to come, his sixteen-hour-a-day campaigning against slavery would take him by horseback on a thirty-five-thousand-mile odyssey, from waterfront pubs to an audience with an emperor, from the decks of navy ships to parliamentary hearing rooms. More than once people would threaten to kill him, and on a Liverpool pier in the midst of a storm, a group of slave ship officers would nearly succeed. Almost forgotten today, he remains one of the towering figures in the history of human rights. Although we will not meet him until Part II of this book, he is its central character.<br> There are many others as well, most of whom were not at the meeting that day. John Newton was a slave ship captain who would later write the hymn Amazing Grace.&#x201d; Olaudah Equiano was a resourceful slave who earned his freedom, spoke out for others in bondage, and reached tens of thousands of readers with his life story. Granville Sharp, a musician, pamphleteer, and all-round eccentric, rescued a succession of blacks in England from being returned to slavery in the Americas. A London dandy named James Stephen fled to the West Indies to escape an intricately tangled love life, and then was transformed when some slaves he saw in a Barbados courtroom were sentenced to a punishment he found almost unimaginable. A colleague of his became the only abolitionist leader who ever crossed the Atlantic on a slave ship, taking notes in Greek letters to disguise them from the eyes of prying crewmen. Later in time, another key figure was a Quaker widow whose passionate stand against all compromise helped reignite a movement in the doldrums. And one was the leader of history&#x2019;s largest slave revolt, which defeated the armies of Europe&#x2019;s two most powerful empires.<br> The British abolitionists were shocked by what they came to learn about slavery and the slave trade. They were deeply convinced that they lived in a remarkable time that would see both evils swept from the face of the earth. Like anyone who wages such a fight, they discovered that injustice does not vanish so easily. But their passion and optimism are still contagious and still relevant to our times, when, in so many parts of the world, equal rights for all men and women seem far distant.<br> The movement they forged is a landmark for an additional reason. There is always something mysterious about human empathy, and when we feel it and when we don&#x2019;t. Its sudden upwelling at this particular moment caught everyone by surprise. Slaves and other subjugated people have rebelled throughout history, but the campaign in England was something never seen before: it was the first time a large number of people became outraged, and stayed outraged for many years, over someone else&#x2019;s rights. And most startling of all, the rights of people of another color, on another continent. No one was more taken aback by this than Stephen Fuller, the London agent for Jamaica&#x2019;s planters, an absentee plantation owner himself and a central figure in the proslavery lobby. As tens of thousands of protesters signed petitions to Parliament, Fuller was amazed that these were stating no grievance or injury of any kind or sort, affecting the Petitioners themselves.&#x201d; His bafflement is understandable. He was seeing something new in history.<br> At times...</p><h2>Undone</h2><p>In the trauma center of Atlanta&#x2019;s busiest hospital, Sara Linton treats the city&#x2019;s poor, wounded, and unlucky&#x2014;and finds refuge from the tragedy that rocked her life in rural Grant County.

There was a lot to be said for a man who, after&nbsp;forty years, still managed to hold your attention.<br><br>&nbsp;Judith rolled down the car window, letting in some of the cool,&nbsp;spring air. Downtown Atlanta was only thirty minutes away, but out&nbsp;here in Conyers, you could still find areas of undeveloped land, even&nbsp;some small farms. It was a quiet place, and Atlanta was just far&nbsp;enough away so that she could appreciate the peace. Still, Judith&nbsp;sighed as she caught a quick glimpse of the city&#x2019;s skyscrapers on the&nbsp;distant horizon, thinking, <i>home</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>She was surprised at the thought, that Atlanta was now a place she&nbsp;considered her home. Her life until recently had been suburban, even&nbsp;rural. She preferred the open spaces to the concrete sidewalks of the&nbsp;city, even while she admitted that it was nice living in so central a&nbsp;location that you could walk to the corner store or a little caf� if&nbsp;the mood struck you.&nbsp;<br><br>Days would pass without her even having to get into a car&#x2013;&nbsp;the type of life she would have never dreamed of ten years ago. She&nbsp;could tell Henry felt the same. His shoulders bunched up around his&nbsp;ears with tight resolve as he navigated the Buick down a narrow&nbsp;country road. After decades of driving just about every highway and&nbsp;interstate in the country, he instinctively knew all the back routes,&nbsp;the doglegs and shortcuts.&nbsp;<br><br>Judith trusted him to get them home safely. She sat back in her&nbsp;seat, staring out the window, blurring her eyes so that the trees bordering&nbsp;the road seemed more like a thick forest. She made the trip to&nbsp;Conyers at least once a week, and every time she felt like she saw&nbsp;something new&#x2013;a small house she&#x2019;d never noticed, a bridge she&#x2019;d&nbsp;bumped over many times but never paid attention to. Life was like&nbsp;that. You didn&#x2019;t realize what was passing you by until you slowed&nbsp;down a little bit to get a better look.&nbsp;<br><br>They&#x2019;d just come from an anniversary party in their honor,&nbsp;thrown together by their son. Well, more likely thrown together by&nbsp;Tom&#x2019;s wife, who managed his life like an executive assistant, housekeeper,&nbsp;babysitter, cook and&#x2013;presumably&#x2013;concubine all rolled up&nbsp;into one. Tom had been a joyful surprise, his birth an event doctors&nbsp;had said would never come about. Judith had loved every part of him&nbsp;on first sight, accepted him as a gift that she would cherish with every&nbsp;bone in her body. She had done everything for him, and now that&nbsp;Tom was in his thirties, he still seemed to need an awful lot of taking&nbsp;care of. Perhaps Judith had been too conventional a wife, too subservient&nbsp;a mother, so that her son had grown into the sort of man&nbsp;who needed&#x2013;expected&#x2013;a wife to do everything for him.&nbsp;Judith certainly had not enslaved herself to Henry. They had&nbsp;married in 1969, a time when women could actually have interests&nbsp;other than cooking the perfect pot roast and discovering the best&nbsp;method to get stains out of the carpet. From the start, Judith had&nbsp;been determined to make her life as interesting as possible. She&#x2019;d been&nbsp;a room mother at Tom&#x2019;s school. She&#x2019;d volunteered at the local homeless&nbsp;shelter and helped start a recycling group in the neighborhood.&nbsp;When Tom was older, Judith took a job doing light bookkeeping for&nbsp;a local business and joined a running team through the church to&nbsp;train for marathons. This active lifestyle stood in stark contrast to&nbsp;that of Judith&#x2019;s own mother, a woman who toward the end of her life&nbsp;was so ravaged from raising nine children, so drained from the constant&nbsp;physical demands of being a farmer&#x2019;s wife, that some days she&nbsp;was too depressed to even speak.&nbsp;<br><br>Though, Judith had to admit, she had herself been a somewhat&nbsp;typical woman in those early years. Embarrassingly, she was one of&nbsp;those girls who had gone to college specifically to find a husband. She&nbsp;had grown up near Scranton, Pennsylvania, in a town so small it&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t merit a dot on the map. The only men available to her were&nbsp;farmers, and they were hardly interested in Judith. Judith could not&nbsp;blame them. The mirror told no lies. She was a bit too plump, a bit&nbsp;too bucktoothed, and a bit too much of everything else, to be the&nbsp;sort of woman Scranton men took for a wife. And then there was her&nbsp;father, a stern disciplinarian whom no sane man would seek out for a&nbsp;father-in-law, at least not in exchange for a bucktoothed, pearshaped&nbsp;girl who had no natural talent for farming.&nbsp;<br><br>The truth was that Judith had always been the odd one in the family,&nbsp;the one who didn&#x2019;t quite fit in. She read too much. She hated&nbsp;farmwork. Even as a young girl, she was not drawn to animals and&nbsp;did not want to be responsible for their care and feeding. None of her&nbsp;sisters and brothers had been sent away for higher education. There&nbsp;were two brothers who had dropped out of ninth grade, and an older&nbsp;sister who had married rather quickly and given birth to her first&nbsp;child seven months later. Not that anyone bothered to do the math.&nbsp;Enveloped in a constant state of denial, her mother had remarked to&nbsp;her dying day that her first grandchild had always been big-boned,&nbsp;even as an infant. Thankfully, Judith&#x2019;s father had seen the writing on&nbsp;the wall so far as his middle girl was concerned. There would be no&nbsp;marriage of convenience with any of the local boys, not least of all&nbsp;because none of them found her remotely convenient. Bible college,&nbsp;he decided, was not just Judith&#x2019;s last&#x2013;but her only&#x2013;chance.&nbsp;At the age of six, Judith had been struck in the eye by a flying&nbsp;piece of debris as she chased after the tractor. From that moment on,&nbsp;she&#x2019;d always worn glasses. People assumed she was cerebral because of&nbsp;the glasses, when in fact the opposite was true. Yes, she loved to read,&nbsp;but her tastes ran more toward trashy dime novel than literary. Still, the&nbsp;egghead label had stuck. What was it they used to say? &#x201c;Men don&#x2019;t&nbsp;make passes at women who wear glasses.&#x201d; So, it was surprising&#x2013;no,&nbsp;more like shocking&#x2013;when on Judith&#x2019;s first day of college in her first&nbsp;class, the teaching assistant had winked at her.<br><br>She had thought something was in his eye, but there was no mistaking&nbsp;Henry Coldfield&#x2019;s intentions when, after class, he had pulled&nbsp;her aside and asked her if she&#x2019;d like to go down to the drugstore and&nbsp;have a soda with him. The wink, apparently, was the beginning and&nbsp;end of his gregariousness. Henry was a very shy man in person;&nbsp;strange, considering he later became the top salesman for a liquor distribution&nbsp;company&#x2013;a job he passionately despised even three years&nbsp;past retirement.&nbsp;<br><br>Judith supposed Henry&#x2019;s ability to blend had come from being the&nbsp;son of an Army colonel, moving around the country so often, never&nbsp;staying at one base more than a few years at a time. There was no passionate&nbsp;love at first sight&#x2013;that came later. Initially, Judith had simply&nbsp;been attracted to the fact that Henry was attracted to her. It was a&nbsp;novelty for the pear from Scranton, but Judith had always been at the&nbsp;opposite spectrum of Marx&#x2019;s philosophy&#x2013;Groucho, not Karl: She&nbsp;was more than willing to join any club that would have her as a member.&nbsp;Henry was a club unto himself. He was neither handsome nor&nbsp;ugly; forward nor reticent. With his neatly parted hair and flat accent,&nbsp;<i>average </i>would be the best way to describe him, which Judith&nbsp;later did in a letter to her older sister. Rosa&#x2019;s response had been something&nbsp;along the lines of, &#x201c;Well, I suppose that&#x2019;s the best you can hope&nbsp;for.&#x201d; In her defense, Rosa was pregnant at the time with her third&nbsp;child while her second was still in diapers, but still, Judith had never&nbsp;forgiven her sister for the slight&#x2013;not against herself, but against&nbsp;Henry. If Rosa failed to notice how special Henry was, it was because&nbsp;Judith was a poor writer; Henry too nuanced a man for mere&nbsp;words on a page. Perhaps it was all for the best. Rosa&#x2019;s sour observation&nbsp;had given Judith a reason to break from her family and embrace&nbsp;this winkingly introverted, mercurial stranger.&nbsp;<br><br>Henry&#x2019;s gregarious shyness was only the first of many dichotomies&nbsp;Judith had observed in her husband over the years. He was&nbsp;terrified of heights, but had earned his amateur pilot&#x2019;s license as a&nbsp;teenager. He sold alcohol but never imbibed. He was a homebody,&nbsp;but he spent most of his adult life traveling through the Northwest,&nbsp;then the Midwest, as promotions moved them around the country&nbsp;much like the Army had done when Henry was a child. His life, it&nbsp;seemed, was all about making himself do things he did not want to&nbsp;do. And yet, he often told Judith that her company was the one thing&nbsp;that he truly enjoyed.&nbsp;<br><br>Forty years, and so many surprises.&nbsp;<br><br>Sadly, Judith doubted her son held any such surprises for his&nbsp;spouse. While Tom was growing up, Henry was on the road three&nbsp;weeks out of every four, and his parenting came in spurts that didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;necessarily highlight his more compassionate side. Subsequently,&nbsp;Tom became everything his father had shown him during those&amp;...</p><h2>Comfortable with Uncertainty: 108 Teachings on Cultivating Fearlessness and Compassion</h2><p>This book by the renowned American Buddhist nun offers short, stand-alone readings designed to help us cultivate compassion and awareness amid the challenges of daily living. <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> does not assume prior knowledge of Buddhist thought or practice, making it a perfect introduction to Pema Ch�dr�n's teaching on lovingkindness, meditation, mindfulness, "nowness," letting go, and working with fear and other painful emotions. More than a collection of thoughts for the day, <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> offers a progressive program of spiritual study, leading the reader through essential concepts, themes, and practices on the Buddhist path.</p><p><i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> reads like a perfect companion guide to the traditional 108-day Buddhist retreat. In a day-by-day format, author Pema Ch�dr�n dives into the soothing wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism, reminding us that groundlessness is the only ground we have to stand on. Each of her 108 teachings are brief (about two pages), and all of them are excerpted from longer discussions in Ch�dr�n's previous bestselling books (<i>The Places That Scare You</i> and <i>When Things Fall Apart</i>). Nonetheless, newcomers as well as seasoned fans of Ch�dr�n's writing will glean much from this training program for becoming a "warrior bodhisattva"--a term which, simply put, means one who aspires to act from an awakened heart.<p>Gradually, Ch�dr�n guides readers beyond the tunnel vision of the self, expanding outward to include compassion for all of humanity. In the 12th teaching, "The Root of Suffering," Ch�dr�n writes: "What keeps us unhappy and stuck in a limited view of reality is our tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain, to seek security and avoid groundlessness, to seek comfort and avoid discomfort." In the 77th teaching, "Cool Loneliness," she suggests that the next time readers wake up in the morning feeling the "heartache of alienation" they try to "relax and touch the limitless space of the human heart." By the 101st teaching, Ch�dr�n speaks to "taking refuge in the Sangha," meaning becoming warriors who are not only committed to taking off their own armors of self-pity, but are also committed to gently helping others do the same. Student warriors will also appreciate the glossary, bibliography, and resource guide in the back. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Chodron, a Buddhist nun, teaches the philosophy that she shares with studentsin her workshops, seminars, and meditation retreats around the world.3 CDs.</p><h2>My Life in Middlemarch</h2><p><b>A <i>New Yorker</i> writer revisits the seminal book of her youth--<i>Middlemarch</i>--and fashions a singular, involving story of how a passionate attachment to a great work of literature can shape our lives and help us to read our own histories.</b> <br><br>Rebecca Mead was a young woman in an English coastal town when she first read George Eliot's <i>Middlemarch</i>, regarded by many as the greatest English novel. After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and reread <i>Middlemarch</i>. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people," offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not.<br><br>In this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that deftly mirrors that of the novel, <i>My Life in Middlemarch</i> takes the themes of Eliot's masterpiece--the complexity of love, the meaning of marriage, the foundations of morality, and the drama of aspiration and failure--and brings them into our world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an exploration of the way aspects of Mead's life uncannily echo that of Eliot herself, <i>My Life in Middlemarch</i> is for every ardent lover of literature who cares about why we read books, and how they read us.</p><p><p><b></b></p> <b>Rebecca Mead on writing My Life in Middlemarch</b> <p></p> <p>I first read Middlemarch, which many critics consider the greatest novel in the English language, when I was seventeen. The novel tells the interweaving stories of several residents of a provincial town in the Midlands; but to describe it this way is a bit like describing Everest as a really tall, ice-covered mountain. In its psychological acuity and generosity of spirit, in the deftness of its humor and immensity of its intelligence, Middlemarch offers everything we go to books for. It&#x2019;s awesome, in every sense of the word.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve gone back to it every five years or so since, and every time I see something new. When I was an anxious, aspiring teenager, it seemed to be all about the anxieties and aspirations of youth. In my twenties, stumbling through misbegotten love affairs, it seemed to be about the meaning of love and marriage. In my thirties, establishing my career as a writer, the novel seemed to offer cautionary insight into how one might or might not achieve one&#x2019;s ambitions. By the time I was forty, conscious of the doors of youth closing behind me, the book seemed to offer a melancholy insight into the resignations of middle age.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>So revisiting Middlemarch by writing a book about it was also way of reckoning with the life I had lived so far: of looking at the choices I had made, the paths I had taken, and considering the alternative lives I had left unlived. For it, I read the diaries and letters of George Eliot, the book&#x2019;s author, who was born Mary Ann Evans in 1819; I visited the places she had lived, and I read about the lives of people who had been close to her. Having started out as the humble daughter of a provincial land agent, Eliot transformed herself into one of the dominant intellectual forces of her era&#x2014;first as an editor and critic for the most important London periodicals, and only later as a novelist. &#x201c;One has to spend so many years in learning how to be happy,&#x201d; she wrote to a friend when she was just twenty-four. She did find happiness: in love found late, and in a vocation discovered in maturity. &#x201c;I feel very full of thankfulness for all the creatures I have got to love, all the beautiful and great things that are given to me to know, and I feel, too, much younger and more hopeful, as if a great deal of life and work were still before me,&#x201d; Eliot wrote in 1861, when she was forty-one. Her greatest work was still before her: Middlemarch was ten years in the future.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>I hope that I have written a book that can be read by people who haven&#x2019;t read Middlemarch&#x2014;though I also hope that my book will make those readers want to discover George Eliot&#x2019;s masterpiece for themselves. I wanted to write a book that would speak to any passionate reader. Often, reading is thought of as escapism: we talk of &#x201c;getting lost&#x201d; in a book. But a book can also be where one finds oneself; and as I wrote My Life in Middlemarch I found that the novel spoke to me differently than it had during any of my earlier readings. Going back to Middlemarch gave me the chance to look at where I was in my life, and to ask myself how I had got there&#x2014;and to think, with a renewed sense of hopefulness, about where I might go next.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p>REBECCA MEAD is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>.

As I drive over train tracks, it enters my mind that the Georgia Prison for Women is on the wrong side of them and maybe I should take it as another warning and turn back. It&#x2019;s not quite four p.m., Thursday, June 30. There&#x2019;s time to catch the last flight to Boston, but I know I won&#x2019;t.</p><p>This part of coastal Georgia is a moody terrain of brooding forests draped with Spanish moss and mudflats etched with convoluted creeks that give way to grassy plains heavy with light. Snowy egrets and great blue herons fly low over brackish water, dragging their feet, and then the woods close in again on either side of the narrow tar-laced road I&#x2019;m on. Coiling kudzu strangles underbrush and cloaks forest canopies in scaly dark leaves, and giant cypress trees with thick gnarled knees rise out of swamps like prehistoric creatures wading and prowling. While I&#x2019;ve yet to spot an alligator or a snake, I&#x2019;m sure they are there and aware of my big white machine roaring and chugging and backfiring.</p><p>How I ended up in such a rattletrap that wanders all over the road and stinks like fast food and cigarettes with a whiff of rotting fish, I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s not what I told my chief of staff, Bryce, to reserve, which was a safe, dependable, mid-size sedan, preferably a Volvo or a Camry, with side and head air bags and a GPS. When I was met outside the airport terminal by a young man in a white cargo van that doesn&#x2019;t have air-conditioning or even a map, I told him there had been an error. I&#x2019;d been given someone else&#x2019;s vehicle by mistake. He pointed out the contract has my name on it, Kate Scarpetta, and I said my first name is Kay, not Kate, and I didn&#x2019;t care whose name was on it. A cargo van wasn&#x2019;t what I ordered. Lowcountry Concierge Connection was very sorry, said the young man, who was quite tan and dressed in a tank top, camo shorts, and fishing shoes. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine what happened. Obviously a computer problem. He&#x2019;d be glad to get me something else, but it would be much later in the day, possibly tomorrow.</p><p>So far nothing is going the way I&#x2019;d planned, and I imagine my husband, Benton, saying he told me so. I see him leaning against the travertine countertop in the kitchen last night, tall and slender, with thick silver hair, his chiseled handsome face watching me somberly as we argued again about my coming here. It&#x2019;s only now that the last trace of my headache is gone. I don&#x2019;t know why a part of me still believes, contrary to evidence, that half a bottle of wine will resolve differences. It might have been more than half. It was a very nice pinot grigio for the money, light and clean with a hint of apples.</p><p>The air blowing through the open windows is thick and hot, and I smell the pungent, sulfuric odor of decomposing vegetation, of salt marshes and pluff mud. The van hesitates and surges by fits and starts around a sun-dappled bend where turkey buzzards forage on something dead. The huge ugly birds with their ragged wings and naked heads lift off in slow, heavy flaps as I swerve around the stiff pelt of a raccoon, the sultry air carrying a sharp putrid stench I know all too well. Animal or human, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. I can recognize death from a distance, and were I to get out and take a close look, I probably could determine the exact cause of that raccoon&#x2019;s demise and when it occurred and possibly reconstruct how it got hit and maybe by what.</p><p>Most people refer to me as a medical examiner, an ME, but some think I&#x2019;m a coroner, and occasionally I&#x2019;m confused with a police surgeon. To be precise, I&#x2019;m a physician with a specialty in pathology, and subspecialties in forensic pathology and 3-D imaging radiology, or the use of CT scans to view a dead body internally before I touch it with a blade. I have a law degree and the special reservist rank of colonel with the Air Force, and therefore an affiliation with the Department of Defense, which last year appointed me to head the Cambridge Forensic Center it has funded in conjunction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Harvard.</p><p>I&#x2019;m an expert at determining the mechanism of what kills or why something doesn&#x2019;t, whether it is a disease, a poison, a medical misadventure, an act of God, a handgun, or an improvised explosive device (IED). My every action has to be legally well informed. I&#x2019;m expected to assist the United States government as needed and directed. I swear to oaths and testify under them, and what all this means is that I&#x2019;m really not entitled to live the way most people do. It isn&#x2019;t an option for me to be anything other than objective and clinical. I&#x2019;m not supposed to have personal opinions or emotional reactions to any case, no matter how gruesome or cruel. Even if violence has impacted me directly, such as the attempt on my life four months ago, I&#x2019;m to be as unmoved as an iron post or a rock. I&#x2019;m to remain hard in my resolve, calm and cool.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to go PTSD on me, are you?&#x201d; the chief of the Armed Forces Medical Examiners, General John Briggs, said to me after I was almost murdered in my own garage this past February 10. &#x201c;Shit happens, Kay. The world is full of whack jobs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, John. Shit happens. Shit has happened before, and shit will happen again,&#x201d; I replied, as if all were fine and I&#x2019;d taken everything in stride, when I knew that wasn&#x2019;t what I was feeling inside. I intend to get as many details as I can about what went wrong in Jack Fielding&#x2019;s life, and I want Dawn Kincaid to pay the highest price. Prison with no chance of parole forever.</p><p>I glance at my watch without taking my hands off the wheel of the damn van with its bad case of the damn shakes. Maybe I should turn around. The last flight out of here to Boston is in less than two hours. I could make it, but I know I won&#x2019;t be on it. For better or worse, I&#x2019;m committed, as if I&#x2019;ve been taken over by an autopilot, maybe a reckless one, possibly a vengeful one. I know I&#x2019;m angry. As my FBI forensic psychologist husband put it last night while I was cooking dinner in our historic Cambridge home that was built by a well-known transcendentalist, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being tricked, Kay. Possibly set up by others, but what concerns me most is you setting yourself up. What you perceive as your wish to be proactive and helpful is in fact your need to appease your guilt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the reason Jack is dead,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always felt guilty about him. You tend to feel guilty about a lot of things that have nothing to do with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see. When I think I can make a difference, I should never trust it.&#x201d; I used a pair of surgical scissors to cut the shells off boiled jumbo prawns. &#x201c;When I decide that taking a risk might produce useful information and help bring about justice, it&#x2019;s really my feeling guilty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think it&#x2019;s your responsibility to fix things. Or prevent them. You always have. Going back to when you were a little girl taking care of your sick father.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I certainly can&#x2019;t prevent anything now.&#x201d; I pitched shells into the trash and dashed salt into a stainless-steel pot of water boiling on the ceramic-glass induction cooktop that is the hub of my kitchen. &#x201c;Jack was molested as a boy, and I couldn&#x2019;t prevent that. And I couldn&#x2019;t prevent him from ruining his life. And now he&#x2019;s been murdered and I didn&#x2019;t stop that, either.&#x201d; I grabbed a chef&#x2019;s knife. &#x201c;I barely prevented my own death, if we&#x2019;re honest about it.&#x201d; I diced onion and garlic, the fine steel blade clicking quickly against antibacterial polypropylene. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lucky accident I&#x2019;m still around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should stay the hell out of Savannah,&#x201d; Benton said, and I told him I had to go and to please open the wine and pour us each a glass, and we drank and disagreed. We picked distractedly at my <i>mangia bene, vivi felice cucina,</i> or eat well and live happy cooking, and neither of us was happy. All because of her.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been a hellish existence for Kathleen Lawler. Currently serving twenty years for DUI manslaughter, she&#x2019;s been locked up longer than she&#x2019;s been free, going back to the seventies, when she was convicted of sexually molesting a boy who grew up to be my deputy chief medical examiner, Jack Fielding. Now he&#x2019;s dead, shot in the head by their love child, as the media refers to Dawn Kincaid, given up for adoption at birth while her mother was in prison for what she did to conceive her. It&#x2019;s a very long story. I find myself saying that a lot these days, and if I&#x2019;ve learned nothing else in life it&#x2019;s that one thing can and will lead to another. Kathleen Lawler&#x2019;s catastrophic tale is a perfect example of what scientists mean when they say that the beat of a butterfly wing causes a hurricane on another part of the planet.</p><p>As I drive the loud, lurching rental van through an overgrown marshy terrain that probably didn&#x2019;t look all that different in the age of dinosaurs, I wonder what beat of a butterfly wing, what breath of a disturbance, created Kathleen Lawler and the havoc she has wrought. I imagine her inside a six-by-eight-foot cell with its shiny steel toilet, gray metal bed, and narrow window covered by metal mesh that looks out over a prison yard of coarse grass, concrete picnic tables and benches, and Porta-Johns. I know how many changes of clothing she has, not &#x201c;free-world clothes,&#x201d; she&#x2019;s explained in e-mails I don&#x2019;t answer, but prison uniforms, trousers, and tops, two sets of each. She&#x2019;s read every book in the prison library at least five times, is a gifted writer, she&#x2019;s let me know, and some months ago she e-mailed a poem she says she wrote about Jack:</p><p></p></p><h2>The Girl You Left Behind</h2><p><b><b><b>Look out for Jojo&#x2019;s new book,&nbsp;<i>Paris for One and Other Stories</i>,&nbsp;<b>available now.</b></b></b><br><br>From the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>Me Before You </i>and<i> After You</i>, a spellbinding love story of two women separated by a century but united in their determination to fight for what they love most.&nbsp;</b><br><br> Jojo Moyes&#x2019;s bestseller, <i>Me Before You</i>, catapulted her to wide critical acclaim and has struck a chord with readers everywhere. &#x201c;Hopelessly and hopefully romantic&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>), Moyes returns with another irresistible heartbreaker that asks, &#x201c;Whatever happened to the girl you left behind?&#x201d;<br><br> France, 1916:&nbsp; Artist Edouard Lefevre leaves his young wife, Sophie, to fight at the front.

Crisp baguettes, the flesh of the bread a virginal white, still steaming from the oven, and ripe cheese, its borders creeping toward the edge of the plate. Grapes and plums, stacked high in bowls, dusky and fragrant, their scent filling the air. I was about to reach out and take one, when my sister stopped me. &#x201c;Get off,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie. Wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>I could taste that cheese. I was going to have a mouthful of Reblochon, smear it on a hunk of that warm bread, then pop a grape into my mouth. I could already taste the intense sweetness, smell the rich aroma.</p><p>But there it was, my sister&#x2019;s hand on my wrist, stopping me. The plates were disappearing, the scents fading. I reached out to them but they began to pop, like soap bubbles.</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>What?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They have Aur�lien!&#x201d;</p><p>I turned onto my side and blinked. My sister was wearing a cotton bonnet, as I was, to keep warm. Her face, even in the feeble light of her candle, was leached of color, her eyes wide with shock. &#x201c;They have Aur�lien. Downstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind began to clear. From below us came the sound of men shouting, their voices bouncing off the stone courtyard, the hens squawking in their coop. In the thick dark, the air vibrated with some terrible purpose. I sat upright in bed, dragging my gown around me, struggling to light the candle on my bedside table.</p><p>I stumbled past her to the window and stared down into the courtyard at the soldiers, illuminated by the headlights of their vehicle, and my younger brother, his arms around his head, trying to avoid the rifle butts that landed blows on him.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They know about the pig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Monsieur Suel must have informed on us. I heard them shouting from my room. They say they&#x2019;ll take Aur�lien if he doesn&#x2019;t tell them where it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will say nothing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We flinched as we heard our brother cry out. I hardly recognized my sister then: She looked twenty years older than her twenty-four years. I knew her fear was mirrored in my own face. This was what we had dreaded.</p><p>&#x201c;They have a <i>Kommandant</i> with them. If they find it,&#x201d; H�l�ne whispered, her voice cracking with panic, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll arrest us all. You know what took place in Arras. They&#x2019;ll make an example of us. What will happen to the children?&#x201d;</p><p>My mind raced, fear that my brother might speak out making me stupid. I wrapped a shawl around my shoulders and tiptoed to the window, peering out at the courtyard. The presence of a <i>Kommandant</i> suggested these were not just drunken soldiers looking to take out their frustrations with a few threats and knocks: We were in trouble.</p><p>&#x201c;They will find it, Sophie. It will take them minutes. And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; H�l�ne&#x2019;s voice rose, lifted by panic.</p><p>My thoughts turned black. I closed my eyes. And then I opened them. &#x201c;Go downstairs,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Plead ignorance. Ask him what Aur�lien has done wrong. Talk to him, distract him. Just give me some time before they come into the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>I gripped my sister&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Go. But tell them nothing, you understand? Deny <i>everything</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>My sister hesitated, then ran toward the corridor, her nightgown billowing behind her. I&#x2019;m not sure I had ever felt as alone as I did in those few seconds, fear gripping my throat and the weight of my family&#x2019;s fate upon me. I ran into Father&#x2019;s study and scrabbled in the drawers of the great desk, hurling its contents&#x2014;old pens, scraps of paper, pieces from broken clocks, and ancient bills&#x2014;onto the floor, thanking God when I finally found what I was searching for. Then I ran downstairs, opened the cellar door, and skipped down the cold stone stairs, so surefooted now in the dark that I barely needed the fluttering glow of the candle. I lifted the heavy latch to the back cellar, which had once been stacked to the roof with beer kegs and good wine, slid one of the empty barrels aside, and opened the door of the old cast-iron bread oven.</p><p>The piglet, still only half grown, blinked sleepily. It lifted itself to its feet, peered out at me from its bed of straw, and grunted. Surely I&#x2019;ve told you about the pig? We liberated it during the requisition of Monsieur Girard&#x2019;s farm. Like a gift from God, it had strayed into the chaos, meandering away from the piglets being loaded into the back of a German truck, and was swiftly swallowed by the bulky skirts of Grandma Poil�ne. We&#x2019;ve been fattening it on acorns and scraps for weeks, in the hope of raising it to a size great enough for us all to have some meat. The thought of that crisp skin, that moist pork, has kept the inhabitants of Le Coq Rouge going for the past month.</p><p>Outside I heard my brother yelp again, then my sister&#x2019;s voice, rapid and urgent, cut short by the harsh tones of a German officer. The pig looked at me with intelligent, understanding eyes, as if it already knew its fate.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, <i>mon petit</i>,&#x201d; I whispered, &#x201c;but this really is the only way.&#x201d; And I brought down my hand.</p><p>I was outside in a matter of moments. I had woken Mimi, telling her only that she must come but to stay silent&#x2014;the child has seen so much these last months that she obeys without question. She glanced up at me holding her baby brother, slid out of bed, and placed a hand in mine.</p><p>The air was crisp with the approach of winter, the smell of woodsmoke lingering in the air from our brief fire earlier in the evening. I saw the <i>Kommandant </i>through the stone archway of the back door and hesitated. It was not Herr Becker, whom we knew and despised. This was a slimmer man, clean-shaven, impassive, watchful. Even in the dark I thought I could detect intelligence, rather than brutish ignorance, in his manner, which made me afraid.</p><p>This new <i>Kommandant</i> was gazing speculatively up at our windows, perhaps considering whether this building might provide a more suitable billet than the Fourrier farm, where the senior German officers slept. I suspect he knew that our elevated aspect would give him a vantage point across the town. There were stables for horses and ten bedrooms, from the days when our home was the town&#x2019;s thriving hotel.</p><p>H�l�ne was on the cobbles, shielding Aur�lien with her arms.</p><p>One of his men had raised his rifle, but the <i>Kommandant </i>lifted his hand. &#x201c;Stand up,&#x201d; he ordered them. H�l�ne scrambled backward, away from him. I glimpsed her face, taut with fear.</p><p>I felt Mimi&#x2019;s hand tighten round mine as she saw her mother, and I gave hers a squeeze, even though my heart was in my mouth. And I strode out. &#x201c;What in God&#x2019;s name is going on?&#x201d; My voice rang out in the yard.</p><p>The <i>Kommandant</i> glanced toward me, surprised by my tone: a young woman walking through the arched entrance to the farmyard, a thumb-sucking child at her skirts, another swaddled and clutched to her chest. My night bonnet sat slightly askew, my white cotton nightgown so worn now that it barely registered as fabric against my skin. I prayed that he could not hear the almost audible thumping of my heart.</p><p>I addressed him directly: &#x201c;And for what supposed misdemeanor have your men come to punish us now?&#x201d;</p><p>I guessed he had not heard a woman speak to him in this way since his last leave home. The silence that fell upon the courtyard was steeped in shock. My brother and sister, on the ground, twisted round, the better to see me, only too aware of where such insubordination might leave us all.</p><p>&#x201c;You are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Madame Lef�vre.&#x201d;</p><p>I could see he was checking for the presence of my wedding ring. He needn&#x2019;t have bothered: Like most women in our area, I had long since sold it for food.</p><p>&#x201c;Madame. We have information that you are harboring illegal livestock.&#x201d; His French was passable, suggesting previous postings in the occupied territory, his voice calm. This was not a man who felt threatened by the unexpected.</p><p>&#x201c;Livestock?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A reliable source tells us that you are keeping a pig on the premises. You will be aware that, under the directive, the penalty for withholding livestock from the administration is imprisonment.&#x201d;</p><p>I held his gaze. &#x201c;And I know exactly who would inform you of such a thing. It&#x2019;s Monsieur Suel, <i>non</i>?&#x201d; My cheeks were flushed with color; my hair, twisted into a long plait that hung over my shoulder, felt electrified. It prickled at the nape of my neck.</p><p>The <i>Kommandant </i>turned to one of his minions. The man&#x2019;s glance sideways told him this was true.</p><p>&#x201c;Monsieur Suel, Herr Kommandant, comes here at least twice a month attempting to persuade us that in the absence of our husbands we are in need of his particular brand of comfort. Because we have chosen not to avail ourselves of his supposed kindness, he repays us with rumors and a threat to our lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The authorities would not act unless the source was credible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would argue, Herr Kommandant, that this visit suggests otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>The look he gave me was impenetrable. He turned on his heel and walked toward the house door. I followed him, half tripping over my skirts in my attempt to keep up. I knew the mere act of speaking so boldly to him might be considered a crime. And yet, at that moment, I was no longer afraid.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at us, <i>Kommandant</i>. Do we look as though we are feasting on beef, on roast lamb, on filet of pork?&#x201d; He turned, his eyes flicking toward my bony wrists, just visible at the sleeves of my gown. I had lost two inches from my waist in the last year alone. &#x201c;Are we grotesquely plump with the bounty of our hotel? We have three hens left of two dozen. Three hens that we have the pleasure of keeping and feeding so that your men might take the eggs. We, meanwhile, live on what the German authorities deem to be a diet&#x2014;decreasing rations of meat and flour, and bread made from grit and bran so poor we would not use it to feed livestock.&#x201d;</p><p>He was in the back hallway, his heels echoing on the flagstones. He hesitated, then walked through to the bar and barked an order. A soldier appeared from nowhere and handed him a lamp.</p><p>&#x201c;We have no milk to feed our babies, our children weep with hunger, we become ill from lack of nutrition. And still you come here in the middle of the night to terrify two women and brutalize an innocent boy, to beat us and threaten us, because you heard a rumor from an immoral man that we were <i>feasting</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>My hands were shaking. He saw the baby squirm, and I realized I was so tense that I was holding it too tightly. I stepped back, adjusted the shawl, crooned to it. Then I lifted my head. I could not hide the bitterness and anger in my voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Search our home, then, <i>Kommandant</i>. Turn it upside down and destroy what little has not already been destroyed. Search all the outbuildings, too, those that your men have not already stripped for their own wants. When you find this mythical pig, I hope your men dine well on it.&#x201d;</p><p>I held his gaze for just a moment longer than he might have expected. Through the window I could make out my sister wiping Aur�lien&#x2019;s wounds with her skirts, trying to stem the blood. Three German soldiers stood over them.</p><p>My eyes were used to the dark now, and I saw that the <i>Kommandant</i> was wrong-footed. His men, their eyes uncertain, were waiting for him to give the orders. He could instruct them to strip our house to the beams and arrest us all to pay for my extraordinary outburst. But I knew he was thinking of Suel, whether he might have been misled. He did not look the kind of man to relish the possibility of being seen to be wrong.</p><p>When �douard and I used to play poker, he had laughed and said I was an impossible opponent, as my face never revealed my true feelings. I told myself to remember those words now: This was the most important game I would ever play. We stared at each other, the <i>Kommandant </i>and I. I felt, briefly, the whole world still around us: I could hear the distant rumble of the guns at the front, my sister&#x2019;s coughing, the scrabbling of our poor, scrawny hens disturbed in their coop. It faded until just he and I faced each other, each gambling on the truth. I swear I could hear my very heart beating.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>He held up the lamp, and it was dimly illuminated in pale gold light: the portrait �douard had painted of me when we were first married. There I was, in that first year, my hair thick and lustrous around my shoulders, my skin clear and blooming, gazing out with the self-possession of the adored. I had brought it down from its hiding place several weeks before, telling my sister I was damned if the Germans would decide what I should look at in my own home.</p><p>He lifted the lamp a little higher so that he could see it more clearly. <i>Do not put it there, Sophie, H�l�ne had warned. It will invite trouble.</i></p><p>When he finally turned to me, it was as if he had had to tear his eyes from it. He looked at my face, then back at the painting. &#x201c;My husband painted it.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know why I felt the need to tell him that.</p><p>Perhaps it was the certainty of my righ...</p></p><h2>Sphere</h2><p>"A page-turner...Chichton's writing is cinematic, with powerful visual images and nonstop action.

What they find defines their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a spaceship of phenomenal dimensions, apparently, undamaged by its fall from the sky. And, most startling, it appears to be at least three hundred years old....<br>"The suspense is real."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</p><p><i>Jurassic Park</i> author Michael Crichton is possibly the best science teacher for the masses since H.G. Wells, and <i>Sphere</i>, his thriller about a mysterious spherical spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is classic Crichton. A group of not-very-complex characters (portrayed in the film by Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Queen Latifah) assemble to solve a cleverly designed roller coaster of a mystery while attempting (with mixed success) to avoid sudden death and expounding (much more successfully) on the latest, coolest scientific ideas, including the existence of black holes. Somehow, Crichton manages to convey the complicated stuff in utterly simplistic prose, making him, as his old pal Steven Spielberg puts it, "the high priest of high concept." Yet there is more to Crichton than science and big-ticket show biz. He is also, as any reader of his startling memoir <i>Travels</i> knows, a bit of a mystic--he is entirely open to notions spouted by spoon-bending psychics that most science writers would scorn. <i>Sphere</i> is not only a gratifying sci-fi suspense tale; it also reflects Crichton's keen interest in the unexplained powers of the human mind. When something passes through a black hole in Crichton's fiction, a lesson is learned. The book also contains another profound lesson: when you're staring down a giant squid with an eyeball the size of a dinner plate, don't blink first.<p>&#x201c;Crichton keeps us guessing at every turn in his best work since The Andromeda Strain.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Los Angeles Times</em></p><p>In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel is discovered resting on the ocean floor.

He depicts the arrival of a German family into one such town, showing their careful, loving preparations. Their efforts begin in autumn, when bayberries are picked and candles made; they continue throughout the fall, until apples are dried and strung, cookies and pretzels are baked, "hearts of man" and other paper ornaments are snipped and, finally, candles are lit in every window. This provides a fascinating look at Christmas as it once was: a holiday whose customs were entwined with the season's natural bounty. The emphasis is on the joys of preparation and of quiet, heartfelt observance; refreshingly, gift-giving is not a concern. This is a warm and beautifully realized tribute to the spirit and traditions of the season.

While the church has been mostly silent on the subject of sex, the world and the devil have attempted to make it their domain. The church has rightly proclaimed the biblical prohibitions on the misuse of sex, but it has failed to speak out on the godliness of erotic pleasure in the context of marriage. Out of the 66 books composing the Bible, one whole book is dedicated to promoting erotic pleasure&#x2014;the Song of Solomon. Michael Pearl takes his readers through a refreshing journey of the Biblical texts. This sanctifying look at the most powerful passion God ever created will free the reader from false guilt and inhibition. Michael Pearl says, &#x201c;It is time for Christian couples to take back this sacred ground and enjoy the holy gift of sexual pleasure.&amp;rdquo. This material is intended for mature audiences. Don&#x2019;t read this book unless you are married, have definite plans to be married in the next few weeks, or are an older teenager whose parents have first read it and approve of you doing so.

An Irish Country Doctor began to take shape.Like Only Wounded and Pray for Us Sinners, the book is set in the northeast corner of Ireland, but unlike its predecessors, which I strove to make historically accurate, this story has taken some liberties with geography and time.The setting is a fictional village, the name of which came from my high-school French teacher who, enraged by my inability to conjugate irregular verbs, yelled, &#x201c;Taylor, you&#x2019;re stupid enough to come from Ballybucklebo.&#x201d; Those of an etymological bent may wish to know what the name means. Bally (Irish, baile) is a townland&#x2014;a mediaeval geographic term encompassing a small village and the surrounding farms, Buachaill means &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and b� is a cow. In Bailebuchaillb�, or Ballybucklebo&#x2014;the townland of the boy&#x2019;s cow&#x2014;time and place are as skewed as they are in Brigadoon.Little Irish is spoken in the North, but I have been at pains to use the Ulster dialect. It is rich and colourful, but often incomprehensible to one not from that part of the world. For those who may have some difficulty, I have taken the liberty of appending a glossary (page 345).My attention to the spoken idiom is as accurate as I can make it; however, the purist will note that in 1964, the Twelfth of July fell on a Sunday, not a Thursday, and Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s first book of poetry was not published until 1966. No salmon river called the Bucklebo flows through north County Down. The nearest is the Shimna River in the Mourne Mountains. But everything else is as accurate as extensive reading and memory permit.The rural Ulster that I have portrayed has vanished. The farms and villages still look much as they did, but the simplicity of rural life has been banished by the Troubles and the all-pervasive influence of television. The automatic respect for their learning shown to those at the top of the village hierarchy&#x2014;doctor, teacher, minister, and priest&#x2014;is a thing of the past, but men like O&#x2019;Reilly were common when I was a very junior doctor. And on that subject, may I please lay to rest a question I am frequently asked by readers of my column in Stitches? Barry Laverty and Patrick Taylor are not one and the same. Doctor F. F. O&#x2019;Reilly is a figment of my troubled mind, despite the efforts of some of my expatriate Ulster friends to see in him a respected&#x2014;if unorthodox&#x2014;medical practitioner of the time. Lady Macbeth does owe her being to our demoniacally possessed cat, Minnie, and Arthur Guinness owes his to a black Labrador, now long gone but who had an insatiable thirst for Foster&#x2019;s lager. All the other characters are composites, drawn from my imagination and from my experiences as a rural GP.Patrick Taylor1You Can&#x2019;t Get There from HereBarry Laverty&#x2014;Doctor Barry Laverty&#x2014;his houseman&#x2019;s year just finished, ink barely dry on his degree, pulled his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle to the side of the road and peered at a map lying on the passenger seat. Six Road Ends was clearly marked. He stared through the car&#x2019;s insect-splattered windscreen. Judging by the maze of narrow country roads that ran one into the other just up ahead, somewhere at the end of one of those blackthorn-hedged byways lay the village of Ballybucklebo. But which road should he take? And, he reminded himself, there was more to that question than simple geography.Most of his graduating classmates from the medical school of the Queen&#x2019;s University of Belfast had clear plans for their careers. But he hadn&#x2019;t a clue. General practice? Specialize? And if so, which speciality? Barry shrugged. He was twenty-four, single, no responsibilities. He knew he had all the time in the world to think about his medical future, but his immediate prospects might not be bright if he were late for his five o&#x2019;clock appointment, and though finding a direction for his life might be important, his most pressing need was to earn enough to pay off the loan on the car.He scowled at the map and retraced the road he had travelled from Belfast, but the Six Road Ends lay near the margin of the paper. No Ballybucklebo in sight. What to do?He looked up, and as he did he glimpsed himself in the rearview mirror. Blue eyes looked back at him from a clean-shaven oval face. His tie was askew. No matter how carefully he tied the thing, the knot always managed to wander off under one collar tip. He understood the importance of first impressions and did not want to look scruffy. He tugged the tie back into place, then tried to smooth down the cowlick on the crown of his fair hair, but up it popped. He shrugged. It would just have to stay that way. He wasn&#x2019;t going to a beauty contest&#x2014;it was his medical credentials that would be scrutinized. At least his hair was cut short, not like the style affected by that new musical group, the Beatles.One last glance at the map confirmed that it would be of no help in finding his destination. Perhaps, he thought, there would be a signpost at the junction. He got out of the vehicle, and the springs creaked. Brunhilde, as he called his car, was protesting about the weight of his worldly goods: two suitcases, one with his meagre wardrobe, the other crammed with medical texts; a doctor&#x2019;s medical bag tucked under the bonnet; and a fly rod, creel, and hip waders lying in the backseat. Not much to show for someone possessing a medical degree, he thought, but with any luck his finances would soon take a turn for the better&#x2014;if he could just find Ballybucklebo.He leant against the car door, conscious that his five-foot-eight, slightly built frame barely gave him enough height to peer over Brunhilde&#x2019;s domed roof, and even standing on tiptoe he could see no evidence of a signpost. Perhaps it was hidden behind the hedges.He walked to the junction and looked around to find a grave deficiency of signposts. Maybe Ballybucklebo&#x2019;s like Brigadoon, he thought, and only appears every hundred years. I&#x2019;d better start humming &#x201c;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&#x201d; and hope to God one of the little people shows up to give me directions.He walked back to the car in the warmth of the Ulster afternoon, breathing in the gorse&#x2019;s perfume from the little fields at either side of the road. He heard the liquid notes of a blackbird hiding in the fuchsia that grew wild in the hedgerow, the flowers drooping purple and scarlet in the summer air. Somewhere a cow lowed in basso counterpoint to the blackbird&#x2019;s treble.Barry savoured the moment. He might be unclear about what his future held, but one thing was certain. Nothing could ever persuade him that there was anywhere, anywhere at all, he would choose to live other than here in Northern Ireland.No map, no signpost, and no little people, he thought as he approached the car. I&#x2019;ll just have to pick a road and... He was pleasantly surprised to see a figure mounted on a bicycle crest the low hill and pedal sedately along the road.&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Barry stepped into the path of the oncoming cyclist. &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; The cyclist wobbled, braked, and stood, one foot on the ground and the other on a pedal. For a moment Barry wondered if his hopes of meeting a leprechaun had been fulfilled. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; he said.He was addressing a gangly youth, innocent face half hidden under a Paddy hat, but not hidden well enough to disguise a set of buckteeth that Barry decided would be the envy of every hare in the Six Counties. He carried a pitchfork over one shoulder and wore a black worsted waistcoat over a collarless shirt. His tweed trousers were tied at the knees with leather thongs that the locals called &#x201c;nicky tams.&#x201d;&#x201c;Grand day,&#x201d; he remarked.&#x201c;It is.&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye. Grand. Hay&#x2019;s coming along fine, so it is.&#x201d; The youth picked his nose.&#x201c;I wonder if you could help me?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye?&#x201d; The cyclist lifted his hat and scratched his ginger hair. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Ballybucklebo.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; His brow knitted, and the head scratching increased.&#x201c;Can you tell me how to get there?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; He pursed his lips. &#x201c;Boys-a-boys, thon&#x2019;s a grand wee place, so it is.&#x201d;Barry tried not to let his growing exasperation show. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is, but I have to get there by five.&#x201d;&#x201c;Five? Today, like?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Barry bit back the words &#x201c;No. In the year 2000.&#x201d; He waited.The youth fumbled in the fob pocket of his waistcoat, produced a pocketwatch, and consulted it, frowning and muttering to himself. He looked at Barry. &#x201c;Five? You&#x2019;ve no much time left.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know that. If you could just&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d;&#x201c;Please?&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye.&#x201d; He pointed to the road that lay straight ahead. &#x201c;Take that road.&#x201d;&#x201c;That one?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye. Follow your nose &#x2019;til you come to Willy John McCoubrey&#x2019;s red barn.&#x201d;&#x201c;Red barn. Right.&#x201d;&#x201c;Now you don&#x2019;t turn there.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not at all. Keep right on. You&#x2019;ll see a black-and-white cow in a field&#x2014;unless Willy John has her in the red barn for milking. Now go past her, and take the road to your right.&#x201d; As he spoke, the youth pointed to the left side of the road.Barry felt a mite confused. &#x201c;First right past the black-and-white cow?&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; he said, continuing to point to the left. &#x201c;From there on, it&#x2019;s only a wee doddle. Mind you, sir...&#x201d; He started to mount his rusty machine. Then he delivered the rest of the sentence with the solemnity of a priest givin...</p></p><h2>AIDS, Opium, Diamonds, and Empire</h2><p>It is a mistake to think that wars only concern armies involved in active engagement. Nothing is farther from the truth. The real forces of evil wage a financial war. The dark princes of debt finance have gained leverage over every important social, economic, and political institution-including the health care delivery system.<p> In <i>AIDS, Opium, Diamonds, and Empire,</i> author Nancy Turner Banks draws the connections between free market strategies, the destruction of national sovereignty by the process of globalization, and AIDS as one of the health consequences of a neo-Darwinian philosophy. Through meticulous research, Banks found a medicalpharmaceutical- industrial complex that was taken over one hundred years ago by the titans of financial capitalism. Their aim was to create profit, not to conquer disease. This book of social history points to a cauldron of historical events that contributed to the HIV/AIDS crisis.</p><p> <i>AIDS, Opium, Diamonds, and Empire </i> tells the dramatic story of a financial ideology that is damaging to everything that it means to be human.

But I've got to admit, some days are better than others.<br><br> I've been working on construction sites since I was eight years old and my father started taking my sister, Chloe, and me to work with him. Our mom had died a month earlier and it just made sense for Chloe and me to hang out with Dad after school instead of going home to a big, sad, empty house.<br><br> Chloe and I had thrived around the construction workers, who took us under their wings. They bought us little pink tool belts and hard hats and showed us all kinds of cool stuff to make. The first time I used a stud finder, it was a revelation. And when one of Dad's brawny carpenters demonstrated the joys of the common socket wrench to me, I was seriously hooked. I soaked up everything the guys taught me, from laying tile to hanging drywall. And I knew what I wanted to do with my life.<br><br> Then, six years ago, Dad suffered a heart attack. Chloe had finally gotten her big break in Los Angeles and was working on a home-makeover TV show, so Dad asked me if I would be willing to take over Hammer Construction. I didn't have to think twice; I said yes. And ever since then, I'd been living the dream. Each day presented a new and exciting challenge.<br><br> But every once in a while, I would find a fly in my personal ointment, so to speak, and get a client who was, frankly, horrible. Petsy Jorgensen was one of those clients. She was the quintessential "client from hell." Having to work with Petsy was almost enough to make me wish I had become a barista. Or a brain surgeon. Or a hobo.<br><br> It was a glorious spring morning following weeks of rain. We had desperately needed the rain, of course, so nobody had complained too much. Still enough was enough, and all of this lovely sunshine was like a miracle. I had driven over to Cranberry Circle with my foreman, Wade Chambers, to talk to the homeowner about some work she wanted done to her beautiful Victorian home.<br><br> In a town where one Victorian mansion was more sumptuous and ornate than the next, the Jorgensen house was the pinnacle of elaborate, gracious excess. It stood at the end of the cul-de-sac on a large plot of land surrounded by several homes around the same age, and six newer Victorian-style homes that had been built with love by my father's company to blend in with the originals.<br><br> I took a lot of pride in those homes, and now that I was working on the most beautiful old Victorian in the circle, I wondered, could I get any luckier?<br><br> The Jorgensen house was a classic Queen Anne design, with a three-story tower to the left of the wide wraparound veranda, three chimneys, and multiple gables and dormer windows, all topped off by a lovely widow's walk that spread out from the top-floor tower across the pitched rooftop.<br><br> I couldn't wait to see the inside of this house.<br><br> "Hello. I'm Shannon Hammer," I said when a well-dressed woman opened the front door. "This is my foreman, Wade Chambers."<br><br> "It's about time you got here," the woman said, swinging the door open wider. I'd never met her before and now I knew why. We clearly didn't move in the same social circles-if her initial attitude toward us was any clue. She actually managed to look down her nose at us, which was a real feat, seeing as both Wade and I were taller than she was.<br><br> She was thin and beautiful in a Jackie Kennedy sort of way, with dark hair worn in a stylish bob and great taste in clothes. But she had hard blue eyes and frown lines that were starting to dig deeply enough into the sides of her mouth that you could someday plant corn there. "I'm Petsy Jorgensen."<br><br> I brushed aside her previous comment implying that we were late-in reality we were five minutes early for our appointment. Stepping into the surprisingly large two-storied foyer, I gazed around, taking in the artistry of the heavily carved newel post, the dark wood paneling, the polished handrail, and the unique spiral balusters that graced the wide staircase straight ahead. I blinked up at the dramatic crystal chandelier hanging from the center of an elaborately gilded ceiling rose and had to smile. This house was a gem.<br><br> "What a beautiful foyer," I said, admiring the scrollwork on the corbels that extended out from either side of the archway leading into the formal dining room to our left.<br><br> "Yes, yes, of course, but I'd prefer to cut the chitchat. I don't have time for it." She spoke in a clipped way that sounded very much like Queen to Peasant. "Follow me." She walked into the dining room and we trailed behind her.<br><br> If I hadn't already fallen in love with the house, I might have turned around and walked out. Life was too short to deal with deliberately rude people. I was good at first impressions, and while Petsy Jorgensen was "ice princess" beautiful, she was a socially incompetent, angry, impatient woman. I wondered whether it would be worth our time and energy to continue with the interview, but I decided to keep going for now. Maybe she was just having a bad morning.<br><br> Petsy strode toward the opposite wall and gestured down at the dark wood wainscoting that circled the large, elegant space. "Will you just look at this?"<br><br> I did as she asked and knelt down to get a closer look at the wainscoting. It was actually made up of individual wood panels fitted together, each about three feet tall by two feet wide. A lovely sculpted grapevine pattern, accentuated by birds and the occasional flower, wove itself across each panel. The carvings were wonderful. Some nineteenth-century craftsman had worked his butt off to create these beauties.<br><br> "It's a gorgeous room," Wade said.<br><br> "Very funny." Petsy scowled at him. "If you can't see that it's a disgusting mess, then I'm not sure you know what you're doing." She looked at me. "All I want to know is, can you fix it?"<br><br> Before I could answer, she jabbed her finger in my direction. "And don't lie to me. If you can't do it, I want to hear you say it, because I'll have to hire someone more capable immediately."<br><br> I took in a slow breath, let it out, and managed to smile at her. "I can guarantee you won't find anyone more capable than me and my team. But if you would prefer to make a change, now is the time to let us know."<br><br> She pressed her lips together in a tight frown. She didn't like being pushed. Funny, because I didn't, either. After a few long seconds, she nodded briefly and waved at the damaged walls. "Fine. Go ahead. Let me know what you think."<br><br> I nodded, satisfied that she knew where we stood. Deliberately taking my time, I walked to another panel section and hunched down to study the grapevine pattern more closely. My stomach dropped as I noticed all the tiny holes that had been drilled into the wood.<br><br> "Wormholes?" I whispered, and shivered involuntarily. I hated seeing the damage that woodworms could do to a beautiful piece of wood. But besides the wormholes, there were also large chunks of wood missing in the bas-relief images of the birds and grapevines. In some spots the grapes were cracked, and some leaves were completely gone. Several of the frolicking cherubs had fractured noses and a few birds were missing parts. Woodworms hadn't done that damage. It looked more like the work of some destructive humans. Had someone been playing bumper cars in here?<br><br> I could fix the carvings, but it would take time. The wormholes were more problematic. While plenty of people liked that worn, rustic look, there was always the possibility that the little buggers were still living in the wood. They would keep drilling, and eventually the entire wall of wainscoting would collapse.<br><br> I moved on to examine the next panel. It was just as bad. I checked a few more. Same problem. How had that happened?<br><br> "Well?" she asked in a demanding tone, as though I'd taken too much time inspecting the wood. I hadn't taken more than a minute or two, but I supposed Mrs. Jorgensen was a busy gal.<br><br> "Yes, of course I can fix it," I said. I can fix anything, I thought. Even your stupid wormholes. But I again pasted a smile on my face, and added, "I'll be happy to do it."<br><br> "Good," she said. "Because I'm sick of looking at it."<br><br> "How did all this damage occur?" Wade asked.<br><br> She rolled her eyes. "My husband let his bratty little nephews loose in here a few years ago and they destroyed everything. I'm absolutely certain it's the reason we didn't win the grand prize last year."<br><br> First of all, unless the kids really had been playing bumper cars, I couldn't believe a couple of them could've caused this kind of wholesale damage. Maybe a nick or two here and there, but not all of this destruction. And those wormholes weren't caused by kids. So was Petsy just kidding us? Or was she lying about the source of the damage? I shook my head. Why would she lie about something like this?<br><br> Second, not that it mattered in the current scheme of things, but Petsy's husband, Matthew, was a good friend of my father and a really nice guy. Would he have allowed his nephews to tear this room apart? And while we were on the subject of Matthew, how in the world did he put up with his wife's crabby moods?<br><br> And third, the grand prize she was talking about was the large cash award given each year by the judges of the Lighthouse Cove Victorian Home and Garden Tour. There were dozens of lesser prizes given out as well. It was exciting to see how prestigious the annual tour had become, but now it seemed as if half the town was willing to sell their souls for one of those impressive awards.<br><br> Apparently Mrs. Jorgensen fell into that category.<br><br> I hunched down to take one last look at the woodwork. I wasn't about to call Mrs. Jorgensen a liar, but there was no way a couple of kids had wreaked all that damage.<br><br> I stood up and met Wade's gaze. I could tell he wasn't happy. In fact, he looked more than ready to blow off this job and I was pretty close to following him. But I rarely turned my back on a challenge, and there was Matthew Jorgensen and my father's friendship to consider. So in that moment, I doubled down on my decision and turned and faced Mrs. Jorgensen.<br><br> "I assume you also want to get rid of the wormholes," I said, pulling my tablet from my bag to take notes.<br><br> "What a ridiculous thing to say. Of course I do."<br><br> I thought of Dad and took a few deep breaths. "Fine. The wormholes will be easy enough to fix. But the missing pieces of the carvings will be more difficult and time-consuming."<br><br> Her eyes narrowed. "What do you mean, time-consuming? Can you do it or not?"<br><br> "I told you I can do the work, but it could take a while."<br><br> "You have four weeks."<br><br> I breathed in and out, hoping I could maintain my calm outer shell. "I understand you want it done before the Home and Garden Tour, but my team and I have other jobs we're working on this week. We'll have to start here next week."<br><br> "What? But that only gives me three weeks." She sighed. "All right, fine. But I insist you work for me exclusively."<br><br> "That's not going to happen," I said genially. "But as far as the time frame goes, I would suggest that rather than repairing each panel individually, which could take a month or longer, there's an alternative that I-"<br><br> "But I was promised-"<br><br> "Let me finish, please," I continued softly, trying to remain serene in the face of her impatience. "If you'd care to consider it, we can replace the panels with beautiful wood onlays in a similar style to your grapevine pattern. We would stain them the same rich color and you would never know the difference."<br><br> "Onlays? I don't like the sound of that."<br><br> "I can show you some beautiful pieces that would be perfect in this room. I've got a website you can look at to see if-"<br><br> "What do you mean, a website? What are wood onlays?"<br><br> "Let me show you." Turning my tablet around for her to see, I clicked onto Victorian Home Works, a website that displayed beautifully sculpted onlays in different sizes and patterns and designs in every type of wood imaginable. You could find almost anything and it was all very high quality. I skipped to a page showing hundreds of different pilasters, pediments, ceiling roses, cornices, corbels, and crown moldings.<br><br> I explained that this company specialized in both inlays-which were designs carved straight into wood-and onlays, which were pieces designed and carved separately and then applied to smooth wood or walls. There were scrolls and shell patterns with fancy flourishes; all sorts of fleur-de-lis patterns; roses with leafy froufrous; fan shapes and stylized pinecones. There were even carved bows with ribbons dangling off to the sides. And there were grapevines of every size and style. And all of these were offered in maple, cherry, and other hardwoods.<br><br> "As you can see, your choices are quite varied."<br><br> She shook her head in disbelief. "But these things are . . . why, they're . . . they're fake! I want someone who will actually come into my home and do the work. Someone who knows how to carve the designs into the wood. Why would I use this company and cheat myself?"<br><br> I was about to laugh-until I got a better look at her horrified expression. "Let me assure you that this is a perfectly acceptable way of creating the look you want. The pieces are manufactured in England."<br><br> I covertly rolled my eyes as I said the words. As if something coming from England made it more legitimate? But for some people, that fact made all the difference.<br><br> "Everyone in my industry uses these products," I added.<br><br> "Not in my house," she said, sniffing with contempt. "I was told you did custom woodwork. Is that true or not?"<br><br> "It's true," I said mildly, although I was getting fed up with her attitude. I could tell that Wade was fuming.<br><br> "Then that's what I want. I won't accept anything less. No cheating." I wouldn't have thought it possible, but her frown lines deepened.</p><h2>Valis and Later Novels: A Maze of Death / Valis / the Divine Invasion / the Transmigration of Timothy Archer</h2><p>In 2007, <i>Philip K. Dick: Four Novels of the 1960s</i> became the fastest selling title in The Library of America's history. The 2008 companion volume, <i>Five Novels of the1960s &amp; 70s</i>, broke series records for advance sales. Now comes a third and final volume gathering the best novels of Dick's final years, when religious revelation, always important in his work, became a dominant and irresistible theme.<br><br> In <i>A Maze of Death</i> (1970), a darkly speculative mystery that foreshadows Dick's final novels, colonists on the planet Delmak-O try to determine the nature of the God-or "Mentufacturer"-who plots their destiny. The late masterpiece <i>VALIS</i> (1981) is a novelistic reworking of "the events of 2-3-74," when Dick's life was transformed by what he believed was a mystical revelation. It is a harrowing self-portrait of a man torn between conflicting interpretations of what might be gnostic illumination or psychotic breakdown. <i>The Divine Invasion</i> (1981), a sequel to <i>VALIS</i>, is a powerful exploration of gnostic insight and its human consequences. <i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i> (1982), Dick's last novel, is by turns theological thriller, roman � clef, and disenchanted portrait of late 1970s California life, based loosely on the controversial career of Bishop James Pike-a close friend and kindred spirit. <br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

She brought music and a vivid imagination with her when she came to Canada to teach. There she began a second career as a writer of books that always end happily and always celebrate the power of love. There are over four million copies of her Regency romances and historical romances in print.<i>Chapter One<br>England - 1814<br></i><br>There was a shady dell slicing through the woods on the western side of the park at Ringwood Manor in Oxfordshire. The water of the brook gurgling over its rocky bed joined up eventually with a larger river that formed the boundary of the park and flowed through the nearby village of Heybridge. The dell was always secluded and lovely. However, on this particular morning in May it was breathtakingly beautiful. The bluebells, which did not usually bloom until June, had been seduced by a mild spring into making an early appearance. The azaleas were in flower too, so that the sloping banks were carpeted in blue and pink. Bright sunbeams slanted through the dark-leafed branches of tall cypress trees and dappled the ground with brightness and shadow while sparkling off the bubbling water of the brook.<br><br>Eve Morris was knee-deep in bluebells. She had decided that it was too glorious a morning to be spent in any of the usual activities about the house and farm or in the village. The bluebells were in bloom for such a short time, and picking them for the house had always been one of her favorite springtime activities. She was not alone. She had persuaded Thelma Rice, the governess, to cancel classes for a few hours and bring her two pupils and her infant son out flower picking. Even Aunt Mari had come despite her arthritic knees and frequent shortness of breath. Indeed, it had been her idea to turn the occasion into an impromptu picnic. She was sitting now on the sturdy chair Charlie had carried down for her, her knitting needles clicking steadily, a large basket of food and drink at her side.<br><br>Eve straightened up to stretch her back. A pile of long-stemmed flowers lay along the basket over her arm. With her free hand she pressed her ancient, floppy straw hat more firmly onto her head, even though the wide gray ribbon attached to its crown and brim was securely fastened beneath her chin. The ribbon matched her dress, a simply styled, high-waisted, short-sleeved cotton garment ideal for a morning in the country when no company was expected. She savored a conscious feeling of well-being. All of the summer stretched ahead, a summer unmarred by anxiety for the first time in many years. Well, almost unmarred. There was, of course, the continuing question of what was keeping John away. He had expected to be home by March, or April at the latest. But he would come as soon as he was able. Of that she was certain. In the meantime, she viewed her surroundings and her companions with placid contentment.<br><br>Aunt Mari was not watching her busy hands. Instead she watched the children, an affectionate smile on her lined and wrinkled face. Eve felt a rush of tenderness for her. She had spent forty years hauling carts of coal along passageways deep in a coal mine until Papa had granted her a small pension after the death of her husband, Papa's uncle. Eve had persuaded her to come to Ringwood to live a little over a year ago, when Papa was very ill.<br><br>Seven-year-old Davy was picking earnestly, a frown on his thin face, as if he had been set a task of grave importance. Close behind him, as usual, five-year-old Becky, his sister, picked with more obvious enjoyment and less concentration, humming tunelessly as she did so. She looked like a child who felt secure in her surroundings. If only Davy could learn to relax like that, to lose the strained, serious look that made him appear too old for his years. But it would come, Eve told herself, if she would just be patient. Neither child was her own, though they had lived with her for the past seven months. They had no one else.<br><br>Muffin was down by the brook, three of his paws braced precariously on three different rocks, the fourth tucked under his belly, his nose half an inch above the shallow water. He was not drinking. He fancied himself as a prize fisher-dog though he had never caught even as much as a tadpole. Silly dog!<br><br>Young Benjamin Rice toddled up to his mother, a cluster of azalea and bluebell heads clutched tightly in one outstretched fist. Thelma bent to take them in her cupped hands as if they were some rare and precious treasure--as of course they were.<br><br>Eve felt a moment's envy of that mother love, but she shook it off as unworthy of her. She was one of the most fortunate of mortals. She lived in this idyllic place, and she was surrounded by people with whom she shared a reciprocal love, the loneliness of her girlhood a thing of the distant past. In a week's time she would be able to leave off her half-mourning on the first anniversary of Papa's death and wear colors again. She could scarcely wait. Soon--any day now--John would be back, and she could admit to the world at long last that she was in love, love, love. She could have twirled about at the thought, like an exuberant girl, but she contented herself with a smile instead.<br><br>And then there was the other prospect to complete her happiness. Percy would be coming home. He had written in his last letter that he would take leave as soon as he was able, and now surely he must be able. A little over a week ago she had heard the glorious news that Napoleon Bonaparte had surrendered to the Allied forces in France and that the long wars were over at last. James Robson, Eve's neighbor, had come in person to Ringwood as soon as he heard himself, knowing what the news would mean to her--the end to years of anxiety for Percy's safety.<br><br>Eve stooped to pick more bluebells. She wanted to be able to set a filled vase in every room of the house. They would all celebrate springtime and victory and security and an end to mourning with color and fragrance. If only John would come.<br><br>"Who's ready for something to eat, then?" Aunt Mari called a few minutes later in her thick Welsh accent. "I'm exhausted just watching all of you."<br><br>"I am," Becky cried, skipping happily toward the basket and setting her flowers down at Aunt Mari's side. "I am starved."<br><br>Davy straightened up but stood uncertainly where he was, as if he half suspected that the offer would be snatched away if he moved.<br><br>Muffin came bobbing up from the brook, his one and a half ears cocked, woofing as he came.<br><br>"You must be famished too, Davy." Eve strode toward him, set her free arm about his thin shoulders, and swept him along with her. "What an excellent worker you are. You have picked more than anyone else."<br><br>"Thank you, Aunt Eve," he said gravely. He still spoke her name awkwardly as if he thought it an impertinence to use so familiar a form of address. He and Becky were not related to her, except by a very tenuous link through marriage, but how could she have two young children growing up in her home and addressing her as Miss Morris? Or Aunt Mari as Mrs. Pritchard?<br><br>Thelma was laughing. Flowers along one arm, Benjamin on the other, she was unable to prevent him from pushing her bonnet backward off her head.<br><br>Aunt Mari had the basket open and was taking out freshly baked bread rolls, which had been carefully wrapped in a tea towel. The yeasty smell of them and of fried chicken made Eve realize how hungry she was. She knelt on the blanket Davy and Becky had spread on the grass and took charge of the large bottle of lemonade.<br><br>The ten minutes or so of near silence that followed were testament to both their hard work and the culinary skills of Mrs. Rowe, Eve's cook. Why did food always taste so much more appetizing out-of-doors? Eve wondered, wiping her greasy fingertips on a linen napkin after devouring a second piece of chicken.<br><br>"I suppose," Aunt Mari said, "we'd better pack up and take all these flowers back to the house before they wilt. If someone would just hand me my cane as soon as I have my wool and needles in this bag, I could haul these old bones upright."<br><br>"Oh, must we?" Eve asked with a sigh as Davy scrambled to offer the cane.<br><br>But at that moment someone called her name.<br><br>"Miss Morris," the voice called with breathless urgency. "Miss Morris."<br><br>"We are still here, Charlie." She swiveled around to watch a large, fresh-faced young man come lumbering over the top of the bank from the direction of the house and crash downward toward them in his usual ungainly manner. "Take your time or you will slip and hurt yourself." She had hired him several months ago, even though Ringwood had not needed any more servants, to do odd jobs about the house and stable and park. No one else had wanted to offer Charlie employment after the death of his father, the village blacksmith, because he was generally described as a half-wit. Even his father had constantly berated him as a useless lump. Eve had never known anyone more eager to work and to please.<br><br>"Miss Morris." He was gasping and ruddy-cheeked by the time he came close enough to deliver his message. Whenever Charlie was sent on an errand, he behaved as if he had been sent to announce the end of the world or something of similarly dire import. "I am sent. By Mrs. Fuller. To fetch you back to the house." He fought for air between each short sentence.<br><br>"Did she say why, Charlie?" Eve got unhurriedly to her feet and shook out her skirt. "We are all on our way home anyway."<br><br>"Someone's come," Charlie said. He stood very still then, his large feet planted wide, his brow creased in deep furrows of concentration, and tried to bring something else to mind. "I can't remember his name."<br><br>Eve felt a lurching of excitement in the pit of her stomach. John? But she had been disappointed so many times in the last two months that it was best not to consider the possibility. Indeed, she was even beginning to wonder if he was coming at all, if he had ever intended to come. But she was not yet prepared to draw such a drastic conclusion--she pushed it firmly away.<br><br>"Well, never mind," she said cheerfully. "I daresay I will find it out soon enough. Thank you for bringing the message so promptly, Charlie. Would you carry the chair back to the house for Mrs. Pritchard and then return for the basket?"<br><br>He beamed at the prospect of being able to make himself useful and stood poised to scoop up the chair the moment Aunt Mari got to her feet. Then he turned back to Eve with a beaming smile of triumph.<br><br>"He is a military feller," he said. "I seen him before Mrs. Fuller sent me to fetch you and he was wearing one of them red uniform things."<br><br>A military man.<br><br>"Oh, Eve, my love," Aunt Mari said, but Eve did not even hear her.<br><br>"Percy!" she cried in a burst of exuberance. Basket and flowers and companions were forgotten. She gathered up her skirts with both hands and began to run up the bank, leaving her aunt and Thelma and Charlie to gather up the children and the bluebells.<br><br>It was not a long way back to the house, but most of the distance was uphill. Eve scarcely noticed. Nor did she notice that Muffin ran panting at her heels every step of the way. She was up to the top of the dell in a few moments and then through the trees and around the lily pond and up over the sloping lawn to the stables, along in front of the buildings and across the cobbled terrace to the front doors of the house. By the time she burst into the entrance hall, she was flushed and panting and probably looking alarmingly disheveled, even grubby. She did not care one iota. Percy would not care.<br><br>The rogue! He had sent no word that he was coming. But that did not matter now. And surprises were wonderful things--at least happy surprises were. He was home!<br><br>"Where is he?" she asked Agnes Fuller, her housekeeper, who awaited her in the hall, large and solid and hatchet-faced. How like Percy to keep her in suspense, not simply to rush out to meet her and sweep her off her feet and into a bear hug.<br><br>"In the parlor," Agnes said, jerking a thumb to her right. "Out you get, dog, until you have had your paws washed! You'd better go upstairs first, my lamb, and wash your--"<br><br>But Eve did not even hear her. She dashed across the checkered floor of the hall, flung open the door of the visitors' parlor, and hurried inside.<br><br>"You wretch!" she cried, pulling undone the ribbon of her hat. And then she stopped dead in her tracks, feeling intense mortification. He was not Percy. He was a stranger.<br><br>He was standing before the empty hearth, his back to it, facing the door. He seemed to half fill the room. He looked seven feet tall, dressed as he was in full regimentals, his scarlet coat and its gold facings immaculate, his white pantaloons spotless, his knee-high black cavalry boots polished to a high gloss, his sheathed sword gleaming at his side. He looked broad and solid and powerful and menacing. He had a harsh, weathered face, its darkness accentuated by black hair and eyebrows. It was a grim face, with hard, nearly black eyes, a great hooked nose, and thin, cruel-looking lips.<br><br>"Oh, I do beg your pardon," she said, suddenly, horribly aware of her bedraggled appearance. She pulled off her hat--her old, shapeless hat--and held it at her side. Her hair must be flattened and untidy. She surely had grass and flower bits all over her. She probably had streaks of dirt all over her face. Why had she not stopped to ask Agnes the identity of the military man who had come calling? And why was he here? "I thought you were someone else."<br><br>He stared at her for a long moment before bowing. "Miss Morris, I presume?" he said.<br><br>She inclined her head to him. "You have the advantage of me, I am afraid, sir," she said. "The servant who came for me had forgotten your name." "Colonel Bedwyn at your service, ma'am," he said.<br><br>She recognized the name instantly. She could even supply the rest of it. He was Colonel Lord Aidan Bedwyn and Percy's commanding officer. If she had felt deep mortification before, now she wished a black hole would open beneath her feet and swallow her up.</p><h2>Capitalism For Kids: Growing Up To Be Your Own Boss</h2><p>"Capitalism for Kids" is an introduction to entrepreneurship. Karl Hess stresses how a person can earn a profit in business while maintaining the highest possible standards of honesty and integrity. Includes a self-test to help the reader determine how enterprising he/she really is, as well as an excellent chapter on "Capitalism and Other Isms" that clearly defines capitalism, democratic socialism, socialism, and communism. Although written with young people in mind, many adults will benefit by reading this book, especially the section which was written specifically for parents and teachers. Highly recommended. Ages 10 up.<br><br>"Entrepreneurs, even young entrepreneurs, know that every new day is a new challenge. They know that learning must go on throughout life. They know that learning is not just something you do in school. They know that you do it every day, with every experience, if you are alert and thoughtful. They know that the ability to think includes the ability to change, to adapt, to use new tools and information. Change, which may seem such a threat and a danger to some people, will just seem a challenge and an opportunity to the entrepreneur."

Over a twenty year period of friendship the author developed a profound respect and great love for Alex Stewart, a truly remarkable Tennessee mountain character whose life epitomizes the pioneer development in America. The best of hundreds of hours of recorded conversations with Stewart are compiled into a moving portrait of this cooper, father of 13, farmer, logger, railroad man, and do-it-yourself interpreter of his rugged homeland. Because the ways Stewart tells his own stories are as important as the stories themselves, he is allowed to do most of the &#34;talking&#34; throughout the book. Through his own account of the people around him, Alex describes his rural life in the late 19th and 20th centuries through stories such as when he was bit by a rabid dog, when neighbor children begged for food, or how people gathered honey, made marbles, moonshine or furniture. Throughout his 94 years, Alex, who died in 1985, depended upon his own good sense to direct him and it led him through a rich and fascinating life. This book is a genuine labor of love.</p><p>Author John Rice Irwin is founder and director of the Museum of Appalachia in the nationally acclaimed farm-village settlement of Norris, Tennessee. His main interest lies in the colorful people of these Southern Appalachian Mountains; their history, culture and pioneer-frontier lifestyle.

Unlike other books on Jung and alchemy which contain a psychological interpretation of alchemical material, this work uses alchemy to understand the three cornerstones of Jungian spirituality--the self, the transcendent function, and active imagination. Through the interpretation of alchemical imagery, Raff explains the nature of these three concepts and illustrates how together they form a new model of contemporary Western spirituality. This book is also unique in selecting alchemical texts for analysis that are relatively unknown and which, for the most part, have never been interpreted. In addition, he presents two new concepts--the ally and the psychoid realm. Through the addition of these ideas, and the new understanding that they offer, it is possible to apply alchemical imagery to transpsychic experience; that is, to a world of spirits which may not be reduced to psychological concepts. By including this realm in the study of alchemy and Jungian thought, it is possible to gain insights into the nature of visionary and ecstatic experiences that form part of the path of individuation--the road to completion.</p><p>Jeffery Raff illustrates the spiritual nature of Jungian psychology and the debt it owes to the tradition of esoteric religion.

"Pride and Prejudice seems as vital today as ever, " writes Anna Quindlen in her introduction to this Modern Library edition. "It is a pure joy to read." Eudora Welty agrees: "The gaiety is unextinguished, the irony has kept its bite, the reasoning is still sweet, the sparkle undiminished. [It is] irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be." <br>This volume is the companion to the BBC television series, a lavish production aired on the Arts and Entertainment Network.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The ModernLibrary continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

They come in different forms. You&#x2019;ll think of more. Get used to starting with something small and exact, not with anything as large and as vague as an idea.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE EXERCISES<br> &nbsp;<br> 1.Start with a line. I&#x2019;ll give you one. You can find them everywhere in what you read, in what you hear. Find them in poems, newspaper stories, on billboards, in the conversation of the people behind you at the supermarket checkout. Take the line as the opening of your novel. Write it out and keep going. Let it take you where it will. Write for ten minutes or until you want to stop. The line will likely be gone when you revise the piece, if you do. Maybe it will become the epigraph for your novel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s one line: &#x201c;Most things will never happen; this one will.&#x201d; Taken (with grammatical liberties) from Philip Larkin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s another: &#x201c;Last night the moon seemed to say something.&#x201d; (From Frank O&#x2019;Hara.) One thing I hope these lines do is pull you out of your world and plop you into an imagined one.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2.Start with a list. Your novel begins with a list. Who&#x2019;s making it? Why? What does it reveal about the list maker?<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s the heading for one: &#x201c;Things That Make One&#x2019;s Heart Beat Faster.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And another: &#x201c;People Who Seem to Suffer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> (And read The Pillow-Book of Sei Shonagon, from which these lists were taken.)<br> &nbsp;<br> 3.Start with a title. Why not? What does the title suggest to you? Certain themes, perhaps. Characters. A place? Titles are always important. They can be symbolic, can suggest tone, characterize, can push you along. The title is the essence of the novel&#x2014;which is why, despite our exercise, the title often comes last. Here are a few titles. Do them one at a time. Write and then think.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Heart Specialist<br> &nbsp;<br> Murder Your Darlings<br> &nbsp;<br> You Belong to Me, I Believe<br> &nbsp;<br> Stirred, Not Shaken<br> &nbsp;<br> 4.Start with a character. Many stories (most of mine) begin with a character.<br> Here&#x2019;s one from the unfortunate news of the day: your character is a parish priest who hears the confession of his colleague and fellow curate at St. Paul&#x2019;s Church and learns that his trusted companion has molested a child.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s another: a mother whose child has been abducted. A chance to deal with our greatest fears, certainly.<br> &nbsp;<br> 5.Start with a situation. The situation should be odd and perhaps a bit troubling. It should make you wonder. Here&#x2019;s an intriguing situation; make it the opening of your novel or perhaps the end of chapter 1: a landscape architect cries in a restaurant while dining alone. And: a stand-up comic (you&#x2019;ll have to write jokes!) listens to the neighbors in the next apartment as they fight.<br> &nbsp;<br> 6.Start with an event.<br> &nbsp;<br> A high school prom<br> &nbsp;<br> A death in the family<br> &nbsp;<br> The birth of triplets<br> &nbsp;<br> A frightening diagnosis<br> &nbsp;<br> 7.Start with an image.<br> &nbsp;<br> The smell of clothes drying on a line<br> &nbsp;<br> The sight of salt-crusted work boots tucked under a radiator<br> &nbsp;<br> The taste of Play-Doh<br> &nbsp;<br> The sound of fingernails being scraped along a chalkboard<br> &nbsp;<br> How it feels on your skin when a cloud passes before the sun<br> &nbsp;<br> 8.Start with a subject.<br> &nbsp;<br> Happy puppet syndrome (a neurological disorder)<br> &nbsp;<br> High school<br> &nbsp;<br> Mountain climbing<br> &nbsp;<br> A drought<br> &nbsp;<br> 9.Start with an oddity.<br> &nbsp;<br> For instance: a neurology professor (say, at the University of Florida) takes home body parts and stores them in his freezer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or try this: The poet Hart Crane committed suicide by leaping from an ocean liner into the sea. His father, Clarence, invented the Life Saver candy in Cleveland. Crane&#x2019;s Peppermint Life Saver. Since we&#x2019;re speaking of Cranes, Anton Chekhov had a pet crane in Yalta, a raggedy, one-legged creature that followed Chekhov around. (Was it named Heart, do you suppose?)<br> &nbsp;<br> Joyce Carol Oates<br> &nbsp;<br> WRITING PROMPTS<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;In my princeton fiction workshops i define my role, or one of my roles, as that of an ideal editor: not a rejecting editor, not a censorious or severely critical or interfering editor, but one who defines herself primarily as a friend of the text and a friend of the writer, in that order.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE EXERCISES<br> &nbsp;<br> Here are some prompts to start stories:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An unsolved mystery is a thorn in the heart.&#x201d; This is the opening line of a short prose piece you are to write, meditating upon an &#x201c;unsolved mystery&#x201d; in your own life. You may wish to transpose this into purely fictional terms.<br> &nbsp;<br> As minutely as possible, you will describe a significant place, conveying by means of language the emotion generated by this place in your imagination.<br> &nbsp;<br> You will &#x201c;interview&#x201d; an older relative, asking questions, eliciting answers, and then, in presenting the speaker&#x2019;s voice, removing yourself entirely from the text.<br> &nbsp;<br> A miniature narrative, consisting of a single, very supple sentence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christopher Castellani<br> &nbsp;<br> NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH<br> &nbsp;<br> At most readings i give from my two novels, someone&#x2014;usually a man&#x2014;asks, &#x201c;So, how come you don&#x2019;t just write nonfiction?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s deconstruct this question for a moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> First, there is the intimacy suggested by the &#x201c;so,&#x201d; as if he and I are old friends. I have just read to him from a novel set either in an Italian-American neighborhood in the 1950s or an isolated mountain village in central Italy during World War II. As a thirty-something author who (reportedly) can pass for twenty-six (on a good day), I am obviously not writing from personal experience. The novels tell stories inspired by my parents&#x2019; lives, not mine. I choose to take the questioner&#x2019;s tone&#x2014;and the question overall&#x2014;as a compliment: he&#x2019;s telling me I&#x2019;ve created a convincing fictional world. He believes he was there strongly enough to request that I confirm that there actually exists.<br> &nbsp;<br> Next: &#x201c;How come?&#x201d; Not &#x201c;why,&#x201d; which would be too formal, too scholarly. We are in not a university lecture hall but a community bookstore, surrounded by frothing baristas and beefcake calendars and the homeless. The mood is casual, collaborative. I&#x2019;m a novelist, therefore an accessible storyteller who&#x2019;s assembled a group to entertain. (I don&#x2019;t mind this one bit, by the way; it&#x2019;s a great joy and honor.) What I find interesting is that most readers view the novel form (and fiction in general) as both common and mystical. Fiction belongs to the people, like IKEA art, and yet fiction writers still invariably inspire respectful awe from those who can&#x2019;t fathom shaping their riotous imaginations into a sustained plot of interconnected story lines. The questioner might have asked me, &#x201c;How come you&#x2019;re such a genius?&#x201d; Or, at least, &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you get so lucky to publish your stuff?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The next and most important word: just. Despite the fact that nonfiction outsells fiction, and that a book gains instant credibility and increased interest when the phrase &#x201c;based on a true story&#x201d; is slapped across the jacket, there is an enduring (mis)perception that nonfiction writers are &#x201c;just&#x201d; note takers or recorders of information rather than artisans. Some readers think, &#x201c;If I had time and a stack of index cards, I, too, could write nonfiction.&#x201d; And so when they meet someone like me, who is blessed with a rich and colorful family history spanning two continents, they ask, in so many words, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you bother inventing stories when they can basically write themselves?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The truth is that nonfiction (a broad genre, of course, but in this case, the questioner and I really mean the memoir or personal essay) is incredibly difficult to write. Moreover, its authenticity is virtually impossible to certify. Truth, after all, is more elusive and less flexible than the imagination; the details and complexities of our experiences vanish as we live them; and, obviously but most importantly, our understanding of these experiences is purely subjective. The memoir or personal essay writer is heavily constricted by such realities, and it is within those restrictions that she shows her remarkable talent: to re-create lived experience using the techniques of fiction (dialogue, description, point of view, scene) while staying uncompromisingly true to &#x201c;what really happened.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s somewhat analogous to a poet choosing to write a pantoum rather than in free verse. The best nonfiction writers are exquisite storytellers and expert craftsmen; they turn the inescapability and inevitably of reality into the most thrilling and satisfying of tales.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s the long answer to why I don&#x2019;t write nonfiction. The short (and guilty) answer might be: It&#x2019;s incredibly hard. Your plots, settings, and &#x201c;characters&#x201d;&#x2014;yourself included&#x2014;are too limited. You can&#x2019;t &#x201c;just&#x201d; do a ton of research and hold interviews and make outlines; you must have the human insight of a great novelist with double the vigilance and discipline in your analysis.</p><h2>Wives of the Signers: The Women Behind the Declaration of Independence</h2><p>Originally penned in 1912, this historical reprint showcases individual portraits of the fiercely courageous women who endured tremendous hardship as their husbands fought to build an independent nation.

The number of books, monographs and articles, as well as seminars, devoted to the development of one&#39;s leadership skills has been almost exponential growth. This study is an attempt to forge a full-orbed theology of Christian leadership grounded in the teaching of Scripture. What emerges from tracing the theme of leadership through the biblical record is a servanthood pattern, one that is wholly distinct from prevailing secular models. Our exposition begins with the biblical language of the servant, the term of choice for those great leaders used of God to further his saving purposes in the world. Eleven Old Testament and five New Testament leaders are profiled. The portrait of Jesus Christ focuses on three motifs that governed his training of the twelve for kingdom ministry. The Pauline letters are mined for those convictions that governed Paul&#39;s practice of leadership, both of his mission team and of the faith communities that emerged from that mission. The treatment of each leader, from Joseph to Paul, begins with a series of preliminary questions and concludes with a mini-profile that correlates the biblical data with these questions. The final chapter offers a summary profile of the servant leader, one whose character, motives and agenda align with the divine purposes. Though designed as a textbook for upper level college and seminary courses on leadership, the book&#39;s readable format is ideal for churches and parachurch organizations in their leadership training programs. The author&#39;s prayer is that this work will serve as a catalyst to call God&#39;s people back to Scripture and thereby raise up a whole new generation of authentic servant-leaders.</p><p>Don N.

Howell's earlier book, Servants of the Servant: A Biblical Theology of Leadership (Wipf &amp; Stock, 2003) traces the theme of servant leadership through the biblical record.

minded the other denizens of the bar--horned Devish males and furry Devish females, plus a smattering of nonhumans from other worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han was used to aliens; he'd grown up with them aboard <i>Trader's Luck,</i> a large trading ship that wandered the spacelanes of the galaxy.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he was ten, Han had been able to speak and understand half a dozen nonhuman languages.<br><br>No, it wasn't the aliens around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the alien <i>beside</i> him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han took a swig of his ale, grimaced at the sour taste, then glanced sidelong at the cause of all his troubles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge, hairy being gazed back at him with concerned blue eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han sighed heavily.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If only he'd go home!</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Wookiee--Chew-something--utterly refused to go home to Kashyyyk, despite Han's repeated urging.&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien claimed he owed something called a "life debt" to former Imperial Lieutenant Han Solo.<br><br><i>Life debt .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what I need,</i> Han thought bitterly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A big furry nursemaid trailing after me, giving me advice, fussing over me if I drink too much, telling me he's gonna take care of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just great.</i><br><br>Han scowled into his ale, and the pale, watery brew reflected his countenance back at him, distorting his features until he appeared nearly as alien as the Wookiee.&nbsp;&nbsp;What <i>was</i> his name?&nbsp;&nbsp;Chew-something.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wookiee had told him, but Han wasn't good at pronouncing Wookiee, even though he understood it perfectly.<br><br>Besides, he didn't <i>want</i> to learn this particular Wookiee's name.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he learned his name,

.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</i><br><br>The Wookiee moaned quietly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han's scowl deepened.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keep your opinions to yourself, hairball," he snarled.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll know when I've

moment, then he snorted disdainfully, turned, and strode out of the bar.<br><br>Han wondered disinterestedly if he'd actually managed to convince the big hairy oaf to leave for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he had, that was reason for celebration.&nbsp;&nbsp;For another drink .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br><br>As he glanced around the bar, he saw that over in the corner several patrons were gathering around a table.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sabacc game was forming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han wondered whether he ought to try to get in on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentally he reviewed the contents of his credit pouch, and decided that might not be a bad idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;He usually had very good luck at sabacc, and every credit counted, these days.<br><br>These days .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br><br>Han sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;How long had it been since that fateful day when he'd been sent to assist Commander Nyklas with the crew of Wookiee laborers assigned to complete a new wing on the Imperial Hall of Heroes?&nbsp;&nbsp;He counted,

be two months.<br><br>Han's mouth tightened and he ran an unsteady hand through his unruly brown hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past five years he'd kept it cut short in approved military fashion, but now it was growing out, getting almost shaggy.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a sudden, sharp mental image of himself as he'd been then--immaculately groomed, insignia polished, boots shining--and glanced down at himself.<br><br>What a contrast between then and now.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a stained, grayish shirt that had once been white, a stained, gray neo-leather jacket he'd purchased secondhand, and dark blue military-style trousers with his Corellian bloodstripe running down the outside seam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the boots were the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were custom-fitted when each cadet was commissioned, so the Empire hadn't wanted them back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han had been commissioned just a little over eight months ago, and no junior lieutenant had ever been prouder of his rank--or of those shining boots.<br><br>The boots were scuffed now, and worn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Han's lip curled as he regarded them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scuffed and worn by life, all the spit and polish gone .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;that about described <i>him</i> these days, too.<br><br>In a moment of painful honesty, Han admitted that he probably wouldn't have been able to stay in the Imperial Navy even if he hadn't gotten himself cashiered for rescuing and freeing Chewbacca.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd started his career with high hopes, but disillusionment had quickly set in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prejudice against nonhumans had been hard to take for someone raised the way Han had been, but he'd bitten his tongue and remained silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the endless, silly bureaucratic regs, the blind stupidityof so many of the officers--Han had already begun to wonder how long he'd be able to take it.<br><br>But he'd never figured on a dishonorable discharge, loss of pension and back pay, and--worst of all--being blacklisted as a pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;They hadn't taken his license, but Han had quickly discovered that no legitimate company would hire him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd tramped the permacrete of Coruscant for weeks, in between alcoholic binges, looking for work--and found all respectable doors closed to him.<br><br>Then, one night, as he'd tavern-hopped in a section of the planet-wide city near the alien ghetto, a huge, furred shadow had flowed out of the deeper shadows of an alley and confronted Han.<br><br>For long moments Han's ale-fogged brain hadn't even recognized the Wookiee as the one he'd saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only when Chewbacca began speaking, thanking Han for saving his life and freeing him from slavery, that Han had realized who he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewie had been quite direct--his people didn't mince words.&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Chewbacca, had sworn a life debt to Han Solo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Han went, from that day forward, he would go,

After his stormy schooldays, followed by the walk across Europe to Constantinople that begins in <i>A Time of Gifts</i> (1977) and continues through <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i> (1986), he lived and traveled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago. His books <i>Mani</i> (1958) and <i>Roumeli</i> (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. He lived partly in Greece&#x2014;in the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani&#x2014;and partly in Worcestershire.

In 1923 he returned to literature with a number of short stories printed in periodicals. An instant literary success, these formed the nucleus of the <b>Odessa Stories</b>, a group of vivid sketches of Russian Jewish life, and the unforgettable <b>Red Cavalry </b>(1926), written out of his experiences with Budyonny&#x2019;s cavalry in the Polish campaign of 1920.

Bullies harass him, the principal is dogging him, and the girl he likes prefers his best friend. Oh, and Vlad has a secret: His mother was human, but his father was a vampire. With no idea of the extent of his powers, Vlad struggles daily with his blood cravings and his enlarged fangs. When a substitute teacher begins to question him a little too closely, Vlad worries that his cover is about to be blown.

His father was a vampire, but his mother was human, and they died three years ago in a mysterious accident. Now Vlad has only his friend Henry and his "Aunt" Nelly, his mother's best friend who is raising him, to confide in. He has a hunger for blood, although he's been trained since babyhood to be "normal" and not to act on it. He gets by because Nelly, who's a nurse, brings home bags of blood from the hospital where she works, and he hides one or two in his backpack for when he gets hungry. But Vlad realizes that his father had a history he didn't know about when his English teacher vanishes mysteriously, to be replaced by a tall, thin substitute teacher in a purple top hat who seems to know a little too much about him. This story comes with all the usual eighth-grade angst, and none of the characters is particularly gripping. While some vampire fans will enjoy it, others will find the way that Brewer plays fast and loose with the standard vampire lore hard to swallow. <i>Eighth Grade Bites</i> reads like the novelization of an unexceptional made-for-TV movie.&#x2014;<i>Walter Minkel, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All royalties and profits go to CARE International.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In the early fall of 2002, famed travel writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of <i>Out of Africa</i>. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects, and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson&#x2019;s impressions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. <br> &nbsp;<br> From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation, and corruption. <br> &nbsp;<br> Though brief in compass and duration, <i>Bill Bryson&#x2019;s African Diary</i> is rich in irreverent, poignant, and morally instructive observation.

This plainly is cruel and unusual punishment, and it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before the criminals file a class-action suit.<br><br>Nobody deserves to be locked in a cell with obnoxious, whiny, ill-clad tourists. Such sociopaths belong in an institution of their own, a mini-Raiford specializing in hard-nosed discipline and social graces.<br><br>In fact, the entire justice system should recognize and deal with the uniquely repulsive nature of tourist misbehavior.<br><br>Say you&#x2019;re driving through the Keys and some dork in a neon-blue rental yells, &#x201c;Yee-haw!&#x201d; and hurls an empty Southern Comfort bottle off the Bahia Honda Bridge.

Let the police snatch the boor off the highway and drag his sorry butt straight to Tourist Court. Same goes for the drunks, stoners, and public urinators.<br><br>Tourist Court should be set up sort of like Drug Court, only not as lenient. The judges would come from smaller venues, such as Kissimmee, Key West, Naples; places that get a rush of visitors yet still have a vestige of hometown pride.<br><br>First-time offenders in Tourist Court would be permitted to plead guilty in exchange for a one-week hitch at Sandal Camp. This would be set up like Boot Camp, only much tougher.<br><br>Here, inmates would spend seven days and six nights being drilled on vacation etiquette. For example, they&#x2019;d be taught how to read speed-limit signs; how to park within the parallel lines of a parking space; how to drink and dispose of alcohol; how to vomit inconspicuously; how to steer a Jet Ski and chew gum at the same time. . . .<br><br>The drill instructors would be selected from an elite pool of former Highway Patrol troopers, ex&#x2013;�Navy SEALs, and retired tour guides from Epcot.<br><br>Defendants who don&#x2019;t want to tackle Sandal Camp could instead risk a trial. However, all jurors in Tourist Court should be chosen from the hospitality industry&#x2014;waiters, waitresses, bartenders, chefs, motel desk clerks, cabbies. Not easily fooled, those folks&#x2014;and no tipping allowed in the courtroom!<br><br>Once convicted, it&#x2019;s off to Tourist Prison. Admittedly, finding a location for such a high-risk facility won&#x2019;t be easy.<br><br>In the event of an escape, you&#x2019;d have renegade tourists scurrying all over the place with no cash or credit cards&#x2014;a nightmare scenario for resort communities, especially during the season.<br><br>Consequently, the prison is more likely to end up someplace like Mims or Plant City than, say, Turnberry Isle.<br><br>Inevitably, the age-old debate will come to a boil: Is the goal of incarcerating lawbreaking tourists merely to punish them, or should we make a good-faith effort at rehabilitation?<br><br>Many Floridians would argue, persuasively, that the conduct of some visitors is so abominable that they are beyond redemption.

At least four outfits in South Florida advertise shark-feeding scuba trips. These are promoted as &#x201c;interactive experiences,&#x201d; meaning dive operators get to interact with your money.<br><br>Giddy explorers descend to a place where sharks are chummed in and hand-fed pieces of smelly dead fish. The sharks themselves have no interest in communing&#x2014;they come strictly to eat, which is what nature so exquisitely engineered them to do. They are also engineered for hunting, not begging, like stray cats. That&#x2019;s why many dive captains and marine biologists oppose the chumming expeditions.<br><br>Supporters say the practice is educational, helping to raise appreciation for a creature that&#x2019;s being ignorantly slaughtered worldwide, but whose presence is vital to sustaining the bounty of our oceans.<br><br>No one can dispute that sharks are maligned and misunderstood. However, teaching them to seek snacks from humans doesn&#x2019;t seem like the smartest way to save them from extinction or to prevent future maulings.<br><br>Not that most suckers care, but a commercial shark dive is hardly a natural encounter. Sharks don&#x2019;t naturally behave like Central Park pigeons.<br><br>And pigeons, of course, can&#x2019;t sever a human limb.<br><br>In the Bahamas, where these dives have become popular, nine injuries were documented through 1996. Usually, the bitten party was the shark handler, not a paying customer.<br><br>The Florida expeditions concentrate on nurse sharks, a relatively slow and mopey species. Granted, it&#x2019;s not easy to get nailed by a nurse shark, but it does happen. Three years ago, an Illinois teenager snorkeling in the Keys decided to tug the tail of a baby nurse shark, which promptly whipped around and chomped him. It did not let go. With the fish firmly attached to his chest, the boy was rushed to a Marathon hospital. There the shark was surgically dispatched, and its jaws were pried off.<br><br>The lesson of the story is twofold: Never underestimate any shark, and never overestimate any human. These are two life-forms that were never meant to fraternize. It&#x2019;s telling that the supposedly advanced species is the one initiating eye-to-eye contact.<br><br>A shark easily can be conditioned to slurp mullet from a diver&#x2019;s hand. If one day that shark meets up with a diver who has no mullet, it might impulsively settle for the hand instead. They are primordially swift and opportunistic. The ones that mangled little Jessie Arbogast in Pensacola and Krishna Thompson in Freeport weren&#x2019;t rogues. They were doing precisely what sharks have been doing for 420 million years&#x2014;chasing what they thought was supper.<br><br>With its crowded beaches, Florida leads the nation in unplanned shark encounters. The vast majority are nonfatal nips of surfers and swimmers in murky water.<br><br>Humans are not a shark&#x2019;s normal prey, and typically, it flees after the first taste&#x2014;but not always. Last summer, a tenacious bull shark killed a man swimming in a canal near St. Petersburg.<br><br>Three Broward cities&#x2014;Hillsboro Beach, Lighthouse Point, and Deerfield Beach&#x2014;have outlawed the offshore feeding of sharks and other marine animals. State officials contemplated a similar ban, then backed off. Instead, the FWC asked the dive industry for guidelines ensuring that the excursions will be safe for both the divers and the sharks. The proposals didn&#x2019;t satisfy some commissioners, so the FWC is supposed to tackle the controversy again next month. Among the options are prohibiting feedings by hand and requiring chum zones to be located far from recreational beaches.<br><br>A smarter idea is stopping the dives, which are about as educational as a rerun of Jaws III. Chumming sharks is nothing but a thrill gimmick designed to hook tourists.<br><br>Visitors to Florida needn&#x2019;t feel deprived of a swim with the ocean&#x2019;s most magnificent predator.

Since 1917 The Modern Library prides itself as The Modern Library of the World&#39;s Best Books. Featuring introductions by leading writers, stunning translations, scholarly endnotes and reading group guides. Production values emphasize superior quality and readability. Competitive prices, coupled with exciting cover design make these an ideal gift to be cherished by the avid reader. Of the eighty-one years of her life, Nadezhda Mandelstam spent nineteen as the wife of Russia&#39;s greatest poet in this century, Osip Mandelstam, and forty-two as his widow. The rest was childhood and youth.&#34; So writes Joseph Brodsky in his appreciation of Nadezhda Mandelstam that is reprinted here as an Introduction. Hope Against Hope was first published in English in 1970. It is Nadezhda Mandelstam&#39;s memoir of her life with Osip, who was first arrested in 1934 and died in Stalin&#39;s Great Purge of 1937-38. Hope Against Hope is a vital eyewitness account of Stalin&#39;s Soviet Union and one of the greatest testaments to the value of literature and imaginative freedom ever written. But it is also a profound inspiration--a love story that relates the daily struggle to keep both love and art alive in the most desperate circumstances.</p><p>Nadezhda means "hope" in Russian. And Nadezhda Mandelstam, wife of Osip Mandelstam, one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century, is aptly named, for it is hope alone that seems to have buoyed her strength during very trying times. In this, the first of two volumes of her memoirs, she offers a harrowing account of the last four years she spent with her late husband. She re-creates in terse, stripped-to-the-bone sentences the atmosphere of intense paranoia that enveloped Russia's literary intelligentsia. In 1933, Osip had written a lighthearted satire ridiculing Stalin. It proved to be a 16-line death sentence. Nadezhda recalls the night the secret police came for him: "There was a sharp, unbearably explicit knock on the door. 'They've come for Osip,' I said." He was arrested, interrogated, exiled, and eventually rearrested. Nadezhda chronicles each turn of event, describing her feelings of heartbreak and joy with self-effacing discipline. Not only does Mandelstam write with the vitality and insight of the classic Russian novelists, she is far too selfless to write an account of her own travails. Instead, she acts as witness to a society's. Similarly, although Osip's mind became unbalanced by his ordeal in prison, his spirit remained unbroken; it is this liberating, imaginative force that Nadezhda celebrates in <i>Hope Against Hope</i>. <i>--Lilian Pizzichini, Amazon.co.uk</i>Hope Against Hope was first published in English in 1970.

It offers a glimpse into the minds of a vast range of different peoples: early hunter-gatherers and farmers, ancient Egyptians, traditional Chinese sages, the founders of Christianity, trail-blazers of the Scientific Revolution, and those who constructed our modern consumer society.Taking the reader on an archaeological exploration of the mind, the author, an entrepreneur and sustainability leader, uses recent findings in cognitive science and systems theory to reveal the hidden layers of values that form today&#39;s cultural norms. Uprooting the tired cliches of the science-religion debate, he shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn shaped our modern vision of the conquest of nature. The author probes our current crisis of unsustainability and argues that it is not an inevitable result of human nature, but is culturally driven: a product of particular mental patterns that could conceivably be reshaped. By shining a light on our possible futures, the book foresees a coming struggle between two contrasting views of humanity: one driving to a technological endgame of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from our intrinsic connectedness with each other and the natural world. This struggle, it concludes, is one in which each of us will play a role through the meaning we choose to forge from the lives we lead.</p><p><b>Jeremy R.

The book delves beneath the surface of problems facing our world today to examine the dominant cultural assumptions that lie at their root.

With its unique synthesis of thought history, actual historical events, and cultural patterns, it does what no other work has achieved since Lovejoy's The Great Chain of Being. Lent explains in one sweeping argument why global civilization has separated from life. And he shows how we can find our way back into it. Lent narrates the history of humanity's growing alienation from a shared biosphere and from our own feeling bodies with the suspense and art of a novelist. It is heart-wrenching to see to what degree thought patterns can form not only our worldview, but the actual world, handing it over to destruction. The good message though is Lent proves that humanity's destructiveness is not God-given; it is, as any cultural pattern, reversible. That is our chance.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Andreas Weber, author of The Biology of Wonder: Aliveness, Feeling, and the Metamorphosis of Science&#x201c;Shell-shocked liberals and progressives are casting around to explain the political setbacks of 2016.

To have any hope of transforming this perverse and potentially apocalyptic worldview, we will need to dig much deeper into our own history&#x2015;and this extraordinary book provides an authoritative and inspirational guide.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jonathon Porritt, environmentalist and author</p><h2>Pumpkin Moonshine (Classic Board Books)</h2><p>Join a little girl&#x2019;s autumn adventure in this cherished tale from Caldecott Honoree Tasha Tudor that&#x2019;s now available in a Classic Board Book edition.<br><br>It&#x2019;s almost Halloween, and little Sylvie Ann has found the biggest, fattest pumpkin in the patch!

Once she finds it, the problem is how to get it home. This fine, large pumpkin is so big, Sylvie Ann can't carry it. So she rolls it across the field, like a snowball in winter, until she reaches the edge of the field where the ground slopes down. And suddenly, the pumpkin begins running away down the hill! Can Sylvie catch it before it frightens the goats, terrifies the hens, enrages the geese, and bumps into Mr. Hemmelskamp who is carrying a pail full of whitewash? <p> Those who don't know the denouement to this more than 60-year-old classic by two-time Caldecott Honor artist Tasha Tudor will not be surprised to find a happy ending to this exquisite, gentle story. Tudor's delicate orange-framed watercolors of a rural autumn and a bonneted little girl speak to a softer side of Halloween--one that is not overtaken by werewolves, blood, and gore, but is a reminder of the season in all its fresh abundance.

She died in 2014.</p><b>1</b><br><br>Commander Adam Dalgliesh was not unused to being urgently summoned to non-scheduled meetings with unspecified people at inconvenient times, but usually with one purpose in common: he could be confident that somewhere there lay a dead body awaiting his attention. There were other urgent calls, other meetings, sometimes at the highest level. Dalgliesh, as a permanent ADC to the Commissioner, had a number of functions which, as they grew in number and importance, had become so ill-defined that most of his colleagues had given up trying to define them. But this meeting, called in Assistant Commissioner Harkness&#x2019;s office on the seventh floor of New Scotland Yard at ten-fifty-five on the morning of Saturday, 23 October, had, from his first entry into the room, the unmistakable presaging of murder. This had nothing to do with a certain serious tension on the faces turned towards him; a departmental debacle would have caused greater concern. It was rather that unnatural death always provoked a peculiar unease, an uncomfortable realisation that there were still some things that might not be susceptible to bureaucratic control.<br><br>There were only three men awaiting him and Dalgliesh was surprised to see Alexander Conistone of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He liked Conistone, who was one of the few eccentrics remaining in an increasingly conformist and politicised service. Conistone had acquired a reputation for crisis management. This was partly founded on his belief that there was no emergency that was not amenable to precedent or departmental regulations, but when these orthodoxies failed, he could reveal a dangerous capacity for imaginative initiatives which, by any bureaucratic logic, deserved to end in disaster but never did. Dalgliesh, for whom few of the labyrinths of Westminster bureaucracy were wholly unfamiliar, had earlier decided that this dichotomy of character was inherited. Generations of Conistones had been soldiers. The foreign fields of Britain&#x2019;s imperialis- tic past were enriched by the bodies of unmemorialised victims of previous Conistones&#x2019; crises management. Even Conistone&#x2019;s eccen- tric appearance reflected a personal ambiguity. Alone among his colleagues, he dressed with the careful pinstriped conformity of a civil servant of the Thirties while, with his strong bony face, mottled cheeks and hair with the resilient waywardness of straw, he looked like a farmer.<br><br>He was seated next to Dalgliesh opposite one of the wide windows. Having sat through the first ten minutes of the present meeting with an unusual economy of words, he sat, his chair a little tilted, complacently surveying the panorama of towers and spires, lit by a transitory unseasonable morning sun. Of the four men in the room&#x2014;Conistone, Adam Dalgliesh, Assistant Commissioner Harkness and a fresh-faced boy from MI5 who had been introduced as Colin Reeves&#x2014;Conistone, the one most concerned with the matter in hand, had so far said the least while Reeves, preoccupied with the effort of remembering what was being said without the humiliating expedient of being seen to take notes, hadn&#x2019;t yet spoken. Now Conistone stirred himself for a summing up.<br><br>&#x201c;Murder would be the most embarrassing for us, suicide hardly less so in the circumstances. Accidental death we could probably live with. Given the victim, there&#x2019;s bound to be publicity whichever it is, but it should be manageable unless this is murder. The problem is that we haven&#x2019;t much time. No date has been fixed yet, but the PM would like to arrange this top-secret international get-together in early January. A good time. Parliament not sitting, nothing much happens just after Christmas, nothing is expected to happen. The PM seems to have set his mind on Combe. So you&#x2019;ll take on the case, Adam? Good.&#x201d;<br><br>Before Dalgliesh could reply, Harkness broke in, &#x201c;The security rating, if it comes off, couldn&#x2019;t be higher.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh thought, <i>And even if you&#x2019;re in the know, which I doubt, you have no intention of telling me who will be meeting at this top-secret conference, or why</i>. Security was always on a need-to-know basis. He could make his guesses, but had no particular curiosity. On the other hand, he was being asked to investigate a violent death and there were things he needed to be told.<br><br>Before Colin Reeves had time to realise that this was his cue to intervene, Conistone said, &#x201c;All that will be taken care of, of course. We&#x2019;re not expecting problems. There was a similar situation some years ago &#x2014; before your time, Harkness &#x2014; when a VIP politician thought he&#x2019;d like a respite from his protection officer and booked two weeks on Combe. The visitor stood the silence and solitude for two days before realising that his life was meaningless without his red boxes. I should have thought that that was the message Combe was established to convey, but he didn&#x2019;t get it. No, I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll be worrying our friends south of the Thames.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, that, at least, was a relief. To have the security services involved was always a complication. Dalgliesh reflected that the secret service, like the monarchy, in yielding up its mystique in response to public enthusiasm for greater openness, seemed to have lost some of that half-ecclesiastical patina of authority bestowed on those who dealt in esoteric mysteries. Today its head was known by name and pictured in the press, the previous head had actually written her autobiography, and its headquarters, an eccentric oriental-looking monument to modernity which dominated its stretch of the south bank of the Thames, seemed designed to attract rather than repel curiosity. To surrender mystique had its disadvantages; an organisation came to be regarded like any other bureaucracy, staffed by the same fallible human beings and liable to the same cock-ups. But he expected no problems with the secret service. The fact that MI5 was represented at middle-grade level suggested that this single death on an offshore island was among the least of their present concerns.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go inadequately briefed. You&#x2019;ve given me nothing except who&#x2019;s dead, where he died and apparently how. Tell me about the island. Where exactly is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness was in one of his more difficult moods, his ill humour imperfectly concealed by self-importance and a tendency to verbosity. The large map on the table was a little crooked. Frowning, he aligned it more accurately with the edge of the table, pushed it towards Dalgliesh and stabbed it with his forefinger.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s here. Combe Island. Off the coast of Cornwall, about twenty miles south-west of Lundy Island and roughly twelve miles from the mainland, Pentworthy in this case. Newquay is the nearest large town.&#x201d; He looked over at Conistone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better carry on. It&#x2019;s more your baby than ours.&#x201d;<br><br>Conistone spoke directly to Dalgliesh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll waste a little time on the history. It explains Combe and if you don&#x2019;t know it you may start under a disadvantage. The island was owned for over four hundred years by the Holcombe family, who acquired it in the sixteenth century, although no one seems clear exactly how. Probably a Holcombe rowed out with a few armed retainers, hoisted his personal standard and took it over. There can&#x2019;t have been much competition. The title was later ratified by Henry the Eighth once he&#x2019;d got rid of the Mediterranean pirates who&#x2019;d established it as a base for their slave-trading raids along the Devon and Cornish coasts. After that Combe lay more or less neglected until the eighteenth century, when the family began to take an interest in it, and visited occasionally to look at the bird-life or spend the day picnicking. Then a Gerald Holcombe, born in the late eighteen hundreds, decided to use the island for family holidays. He restored the cottages and, in 1912, built a house and additional accommodation for the staff. The family went there every summer in those heady days before the First World War. The war changed everything. The two elder sons were killed, one in France, the other at Gallipoli. The Holcombes are the kind of family who die in wars, not make money from them. That left only the youngest, Henry, who was consumptive and unfit for military service. Apparently, after the death of his brothers he was oppressed by a sense of general unworthiness and had no particular wish to inherit. The money hadn&#x2019;t come from land but from fortunate investments, and by the late Twenties they had more or less dried up. So in 1930 he set up a charitable trust with what was left, found some wealthy supporters and handed over the island and the property. His idea was that it should be used as a place of rest and seclusion for men in positions of responsibility who needed to get away from the rigours of their professional lives.&#x201d;<br><br>Now, for the first time, he bent down to open his briefcase and took out a file with a security marking. Rummaging among the documents, he brought out a single sheet of paper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the exact wording here. It makes Henry Holcombe&#x2019;s intentions clear. <i>For men who undertake the dangerous and arduous business of exercising high responsibility in the service of the Crown and of their country, whether in the armed forces, politics, science, industry or the arts, and who require a restorative period of solitude, silence and peace</i>. Engagingly typical of its age, isn&#x2019;t it? No mention of women, of course. This was 1930, remember. However, the accepted convention is held to apply, that the word &#x2018;men&#x2019; embraces women. They take a maximum of five visitors, whom they accommodate at their choice either in the main house or in one of the stone cottages. Basically what Combe Island offers is peace and security. In the last few decades the latter has become probably the more important. People who want time to think can go there without their protection officers in the knowledge that they will be safe and completely undisturbed. There&#x2019;s a helicopter pad for bringing them in, and the small harbour is the only possible landing place by sea. No casual visitors are ever allowed and even mobile phones are forbidden &#x2014; they wouldn&#x2019;t get a signal there anyway. They keep a very low profile. People who go there are generally on personal recommendation, either from a Trustee or from a previous or regular visitor. You can see its advantage for the PM&#x2019;s purpose.&#x201d;<br><br>Reeves blurted out, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Chequers?&#x201d;<br><br>The others turned on him the brightly interested gaze of adults prepared to humour a precocious child.<br><br>Conistone said, &#x201c;Nothing. An agreeable house with, I understand, every comfort. But guests who are invited to Chequers tend to get noticed. Isn&#x2019;t that the purpose of their going there?&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh asked, &#x201c;How did Downing Street get to know about the island?&#x201d;<br><br>Conistone slid the paper back into his file. &#x201c;Through one of the PM&#x2019;s newly ennobled chums. He went to Combe to recover from the dangerous and arduous responsibility of adding one more grocery chain to his empire and another billion to his personal fortune.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are some permanent staff, presumably. Or do the VIPs do their own washing up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the secretary, Rupert Maycroft, previously a solicitor in Warnborough. We&#x2019;ve had to confide in him and, of course, inform the Trustees that Number Ten would be grateful if some important visitors could be accommodated in early January. At present it&#x2019;s all very tentative, but we&#x2019;ve asked him to make no bookings after this month. There are the usual staff&#x2014;boatman, housekeeper, cook. We know something about all of them. One or two of the previous visitors have been important enough to warrant security checks. It&#x2019;s all been done very discreetly. There&#x2019;s a resident physician, Dr. Guy Staveley, and his wife, although I gather she&#x2019;s more off than on the island. Can&#x2019;t stand the boredom apparently. Staveley&#x2019;s a refugee from a London general practice. Apparently he made a wrong diagnosis and a child died, so he&#x2019;s got himself a job where the worst that can happen is someone falling off a cliff, and he can&#x2019;t be blamed for that.&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness said, &#x201c;Only one resident has a criminal conviction, the boatman Jago Tamlyn in 1998 for GBH. I gather there were mitigating circumstances but it must have been a serious attack. He got twelve months. He&#x2019;s been in no trouble since.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh asked, &#x201c;When did the current visitors arrive?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All five in the last week. The writer Nathan Oliver, together with his daughter Miranda and copy-editor Dennis Tremlett, came on Monday. A retired German diplomat, Dr. Raimund Speidel, ex-Ambassador to Beijing, came by private yacht from France on Wednesday, and Dr. Mark Yelland, director of the Hayes-Skolling research laboratory in the Midlands, which has been targeted by the animal-liberation activists, arrived on Thursday. Maycroft will be able to put you in the picture.&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness broke in, &#x201c;Better take the minimum of people, at least until you know what you&#x2019;re dealing with. The smaller the invasion the better.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh said, &#x201c;It will hardly be an invasion. I&#x2019;m still awaiting a replacement for Tarrant, but I&#x2019;ll take Inspector Miskin and Sergeant Benton-Smith. We can probably manage without a SOCO or official photographer at this stage, but if it proves to be murder, I&#x2019;ll have to have reinforcements or let the local force take over. I&#x2019;ll need a pathologist. I&#x2019;ll speak to Kynaston if I can reach him. He may be away from his lab on a case.&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness said, &#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be necessary. We&#x2019;re using Edith Glenister. You know her, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t she retired?&#x201d;<br><br>Conistone said, &#x201c;Officially two years ago, but she does work occasionally, mostly on sensitive overseas cases. At sixty-five she&#x2019;s probably had enough of trudging gum-booted through muddy fields with the local CID, examining decomposing bodies in ditches.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh doubted whether this was why Professor Glenister had officially retired. He had never worked with her but he knew her reputation. She was among the most highly regarded of women forensic pathologists, notable for an almost uncanny accuracy in assessing the time of death, for the speed and comprehensiveness of her reports and for the clarity and authority with which she gave evidence in court. She was notable, too, for her insistence on maintaining the distinction between the functions of the pathologist and the investigating officer. Professor Glenister, he knew, would never hear details of the circumstances of the murder before examining the body, ensuring, presumably, that she came to the corpse with no preconceived ideas. He was intrigued by the prospect of working with her and had no doubt that it was the FCO who had originally suggested using her. All the same, he would have preferred his usual forensic pathologist.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not implying that Miles Kynaston can&#x2019;t be trusted to keep his mouth shut?&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness broke in. &#x201c;Of course not, but Cornwall is hardly his patch. Professor Glenister is stationed at present in the south-west. Anyway, Kynaston isn&#x2019;t available, we&#x2019;ve checked.&#x201d; Dalgliesh was tempted to say, How convenient for the FCO. They certainly hadn&#x2019;t lost any time. Harkness went on, &#x201c;You can pick her up at RAF St. Mawgan, near Newquay, and they&#x2019;ll arrange a special helicopter to take the body to the mortuary she uses. She&#x2019;ll treat the case as urgent. You should get her report sometime tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh said, &#x201c;So Maycroft rang you as soon as possible after finding the body? I suppose he was following instructions.&#x201d;<br><br>Harkness said, &#x201c;He was given a phone number, told that it was top secret and instructed to phone the Trustees if anything untoward happened on the island. He&#x2019;s been warned that you&#x2019;ll be arriving by helicopter and to expect you by early afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>Dalgliesh said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll have some difficulty explaining to his colleagu...</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of World Religions: Buddhism: Buddhism</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A major landmark of religious publishing and one to be widely welcomed.&#x201d;&#x2015;William Dalrymple, <em>New York Times</em></strong></p><p><em>The Norton Anthology of World Religions</em> offers a beautifully designed library of more than 1,000 primary texts, accompanied by headnotes, annotations, glossaries, maps, illustrations, chronologies, and a dazzling general introduction by Pulitzer Prize winner Jack Miles.

One day, they have a bigger adventure than they bargained for. Prairie Fire! Their old horses will never outrun the flames that are galloping right toward them! <br> What will Cora and Papa do to save their lives? <br> * <br> Cora Frear was a real pioneer girl, growing up on the prairie at the end of the nineteenth century. Her true story is as exciting as any novel. And it is only the first adventure in the Brave Kids series. Coming next: the story of Robert Henry Hendershot, Civil War drummer boy.</p><p>To research her various books and magazine articles,&nbsp;<b>Susan E. Goodman</b>&nbsp;has snowshoed through mountain forests, tried using a blowgun in the Amazon, and scared a moose at rest -- and herself in the bargain. Years ago, she went to U.S. Space Camp as a participant and loved the 1/6 Gravity Chair. Ms. Goodman lives with her family in Boston, Massachusetts.Launching the Brave Kids chapter book series, this morsel of historical fiction springs from a memoir by Cora Frear, born in 1887 and raised on the Iowa prairie. The tale opens as Cora's father, a doctor, invites her to accompany him on a buggy ride to visit an ailing patient. Cora, who often acts as her father's assistant, eagerly accepts. After spying dark clouds and a red glow in the sky behind them, Cora realizes that a prairie fire is heading their way. Her father decides to set a backfire he will sear a patch of grass that, reduced to ash, will serve as a "blessed island of safety" when the prairie fire approaches. The doctor's single match fails to ignite, but Cora manages to find one last remaining match in her father's cast-off vest pocket. The scene is set for high drama, but Goodman's (Animal Rescue) bland prose doesn't do justice to the duo's peril or anguish: "The fire was burning around them. The temperature was almost unbearable. The heat seemed to last forever." An afterword amplifies the historical setting. Illustrations not seen by PW.

To the forces of cultural nationalism hunkered down in their camps, this bold hook sounds a liberating call. There is, Paul Gilroy tells us, a culture that is not specifically African, American, Caribbean, or British, but all of these at once, a black Atlantic culture whose themes and techniques transcend ethnicity and nationality to produce something new and, until now, unremarked. Challenging the practices and assumptions of cultural studies, <i>The Black Atlantic</i> also complicates and enriches our understanding of modernism.</p><p>Debates about postmodernism have cast an unfashionable pall over questions of historical periodization. Gilroy bucks this trend by arguing that the development of black culture in the Americas arid Europe is a historical experience which can be called modern for a number of clear and specific reasons. For Hegel, the dialectic of master and slave was integral to modernity, and Gilroy considers the implications of this idea for a transatlantic culture. In search of a poetics reflecting the politics and history of this culture, he takes us on a transatlantic tour of the music that, for centuries, has transmitted racial messages and feeling around the world, from the Jubilee Singers in the nineteenth century to Jimi Hendrix to rap. He also explores this internationalism as it is manifested in black writing from the &#x201c;double consciousness&#x201d; of W. E. B. Du Bois to the &#x201c;double vision&#x201d; of Richard Wright to the compelling voice of Toni Morrison.</p><p>In a final <i>tour de force</i>, Gilroy exposes the shared contours of black and Jewish concepts of diaspora in order both to establish a theoretical basis for healing rifts between blacks and Jews in contemporary culture and to further define the central theme of his book: that blacks have shaped a nationalism, if not a nation, within the shared culture of the black Atlantic.</p></p><p>There is, Paul Gilroy tells us, a culture that is not specifically African, American, Caribbean, or British, but all of these at once, a black Atlantic culture whose themes and techniques transcend ethnicity and nationality to produce something new and, until now, unremarked.

But any hopes of respectability are dashed as the tenants reveal themselves to be a host of eccentrics: from a painter of nudes to a pair of glamorous young nurses whose late-night shifts combined with an ever-revolving roster of gentleman callers leading to a neighbourhood rumour that Margo is running a brothel.

Following his observations of the heavenly bodies, Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) abandoned the geocentric system for a heliocentric model, with the sun at the center. His remarkable work, On the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres, stands as one of the greatest intellectual revolutions of all time, and profoundly influenced, among others, Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton.</p><p><b>NICOLAUS COPERNICUS</b> was born, the youngest of four chil�dren, in Torun, Poland, on February 19, 1473. Following their father's death in 1484, the children were adopted by their uncle, Lukas Watzelrode, who later became bishop of Ermland. After attending the school at Torun, in 1491 Copernicus entered the University of Cracow, where he studied under Albert Brudzewski. From him Copernicus not only learned mathematics but became drawn to the new humanistic studies.<br><br>In 1496 Copernicus left Cracow for Italy, studying canon law, mathematics, and astronomy first at Bologna and later at Padua. After being appointed canon of the cathedral of Frauenburg in 1497, Copernicus immediately obtained a leave of absence to return to Padua to study medicine, taking his degree in 1499.<br><br>Following a lectureship in mathematics at Rome and doc�toral studies in canon law at Ferrara, Copernicus returned to Poland in 1506, first at Heilsberg as physician to his uncle, the bishop. Following his uncle's death in 1512, Copernicus took up residence as canonist at Frauenburg. Copernicus never took holy orders, taking only as many vows as were necessary for his duties as canonist: in this position he represented the cathedral chapter in the many disputes in which it was embroiled. He defended the chapter's rights and privileges during the war between Poland and the Teutonic Knights (1519-1521), and in 1522 he introduced a scheme for the reform of the currency before the Diet of Graudenz. Meanwhile Copernicus practiced as a physician, offering his medical services to the poor for free.<br><br>Despite his many duties as canonist and physician, Copernicus still found time for the study of astronomy. Continuing the astronomical observations begun in Italy, he sought, by a com�parative study of the ancients, to evolve from them a single sys�tem, at once simple and consistent. In 1530 Copernicus pro�vided a preliminary outline of his revolutionary heliocentric theory, with the sun at the center of the universe, in his <i>Commentariolus. </i>This work attracted great attention, and supporters prevailed on Copernicus to overcome his initial reluctance to introduce a new system of the universe which flew directly in the face of established dogma and tradition. The heliocentric theory was fully expounded in Copernicus's great work, <i>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of Heav�enly Spheres), </i>published in 1543. Copernicus lived only long enough to see the book into print: in late 1542 he was stricken with dysentery, followed by a severe stroke which left him partly paralyzed. An advance copy of the <i>Revolutions </i>was brought to Copernicus at Frauenburg on the day he died, May 24, 1543.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Business Leadership: A Jossey-Bass Reader</h2><p>The second edition of best-selling <i>Business Leadership</i> draws on the best thinking on leadership from the biggest names in the business to explore the fundamentals of business leadership: what it is, how to do it, and what maximizes its success.&nbsp; The books is intended as a resource for both experienced business leaders and those aspiring to the role.&nbsp; Newcomers can read cover-to-cover and explore leadership's scope, purpose, methods, and possibilities.&nbsp; They will find everything they need to get started and grow in their leadership.

In it, authors divulge professional secrets: how they first discovered they were writers, how they work, how they deal with the myriad frustrations and delights a writer's life affords. Culled from ten years of the distinguished <i>Washington Post</i> column of the same name, <i>The Writing Life</i> highlights an eclectic group of luminaries who have wildly varied stories to tell, but who share this singularly beguiling career. Here are their pleasures as well as their peeves; revelations of their deepest fears; dramas of triumphs and failures; insights into the demands and rewards. <br><br> Each piece is accompanied by a brief and vivid biography of the writer by <i>Washington Post Book World</i> editor Marie Arana who also provides an introduction to the collection. The result is a rare view from the inside: a close examination of writers' concerns about the creative process and the place of literature in America. For anyone interested in the making of fiction and nonfiction, here is a fascinating vantage on the writer's world--an indispensable guide to the craft.</p><p><b>Marie Arana</b> is the editor in chief of <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>. A former publishing executive, she is author of a highly acclaimed memoir, <i>American Chica.</i> She and her husband, Jonathan Yardley, live in Washington, D.C.Arana instituted the "Writing Life" column at the Washington Post Book World in 1993 shortly after assuming the editorial reins, and she collates here articles from several top names she's enlisted as contributors over the past decade. Her lavish introductions sometimes run nearly as long as the essays; after the buildup she provides Stanley Elkin, though, his vacuous rambling is a severe disappointment. There are other notable clunkers: James Michener recalls banal advice he has given aspiring writers, while Joanna Trollope's essay, though excellently written, says little more than that creative writing courses might be able to teach writing, but they can't teach creativity. But the best contributions make slogging through the worst worthwhile. Some of the better stories are already well known: Ray Bradbury's account of how he came to write the screenplay for Moby-Dick, for example, or Donald E. Westlake's story of the creation of the pseudonym Richard Stark for his hard-boiled novels. But there are new treasures to discover as well. Jane Smiley discusses why she disavows her most famous novel, A Thousand Acres: "I am no longer attracted to the dire mechanism of tragedy," while Julian Barnes turns in a droll account of his experience as literary executor for close friend Dodie Smith. Though some of the authors do pass on practical wisdom to would-be writers, this collection is ideally suited for those who want to enjoy the "literary life" vicariously. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cajas de carton (World Languages) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Cajas de carton is the first title in the literary series Nuestra vision: U.S. Latino Literature, which features original works by Latino authors living and working in the United States. This work is the Spanish version of the author&#39;s award-winning collection of stories, The Circuit. Jimenez&#39; 12 independent but intertwined short stories chronicle the experiences of a Mexican-American family of migrant farm laborers, as narrated by one of the children, Panchito. Unlike many readers for this level, which anthologize standard works, this book presents authentic, outstanding literature and themes that are highly relevant to native Spanish speakers in the U.S.</p><p>Francisco Jimnez emigrated from Tlaquepaque, Mexico, to California, where he worked for many years in the fields with his family. He received both his master&#39;s degree and his Ph.D. from Columbia University and is now chairman of the Modern Languages and Literature Department at Santa Clara University, the setting of much of Reaching Out. He is the award-winning author of The Circuit, Breaking Through, La Mariposa, and his newest novel, Reaching Out. He lives in Santa Clara, California, with his family.Grade 4-8-Jim?nez has created a moving autobiography that some critics have compared to John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. The story, originally published in English as The Circuit, begins in Mexico when the author is very young and his parents inform him that they are going on a very long trip to "El Norte." What follows is a series of stories of the family's unending migration from one farm to another as they search for the next harvesting job. Each story is told from the point of view of the author as a young child. The simple and direct narrative stays true to this perspective, never falling into moralistic or clich?d patterns. The backbreaking work and the soul-crushing effect of the endless packing and moving are portrayed through a child's dismay at having to leave a school where he has just gotten comfortable or, worse, having to miss several months of a school year in order to work. Panchito's desire to help his family by working in the fields often clashes with his academic yearning. In this case, as in the case of many Mexican migrant farm workers, the American dream never comes to fruition. Lifting the story up from the mundane, Jim?nez deftly portrays the strong bonds of love that hold this family together. An afterword recorded by the author gives even more background on his family. Vargas's narration offers an authentic and strong Mexican voice. Highly recommended for all collections and bookstores.

Known for her focus on the poetics and politics of language and landscape, the anthropologist Kathleen Stewart ponders how ordinary impacts create the subject as a capacity to affect and be affected. In a series of brief vignettes combining storytelling, close ethnographic detail, and critical analysis, Stewart relates the intensities and banalities of common experiences and strange encounters, half-spied scenes and the lingering resonance of passing events. While most of the instances rendered are from Stewart&#x2019;s own life, she writes in the third person in order to reflect on how intimate experiences of emotion, the body, other people, and time inextricably link us to the outside world.<p></p><p>Stewart refrains from positing an overarching system&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s called globalization or neoliberalism or capitalism&#x2014;to describe the ways that economic, political, and social forces shape individual lives. Instead, she begins with the disparate, fragmented, and seemingly inconsequential experiences of everyday life to bring attention to the ordinary as an integral site of cultural politics. Ordinary affect, she insists, is registered in its particularities, yet it connects people and creates common experiences that shape public feeling. Through this anecdotal history&#x2014;one that poetically ponders the extremes of the ordinary and portrays the dense network of social and personal connections that constitute a life&#x2014;Stewart asserts the necessity of attending to the fleeting and changeable aspects of existence in order to recognize the complex personal and social dynamics of the political world.</p></p><p>&#34;Kathleen Stewart is a distinctive voice in research on American culture and perhaps the foremost advocate for the development of cultural poetics as a style of doing anthropology. Ordinary Affects is an extraordinary work of finely observed aspects of everyday life in contemporary America. It is a beautiful book about waking life, being awakened to life, and the fear and desire rippling on the surface of people&#39;s ordinary movements through space. Radical yet familiar, it is a profoundly pedagogical book.&#34;--Lauren Berlant, author of The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and Citizenship&#34;Anything but ordinary, this book rewrites the social sciences from top to bottom through its bleak and beautiful honesty as to the human condition and the conditional nature of our language and concepts. How the author has been able to step outside of the bubble we call reality so as to render reality is a miracle, yet one we might all aspire to on reading this.&#34;--Michael Taussig, Columbia University</p><h2>Steel Magnolias &#x2013; Acting Edition</h2><p>A full length Comedy/Drama for a cast of 6 women. The action is set in Truvy&#39;s beauty salon in Chinquapin, Louisiana, where all the ladies who are &#34;anybody&#34; come to have their hair done. Helped by her eager new assistant, Annelle (who is not sure whether or not she is still married), the outspoken, wise-cracking Truvy dispenses shampoos and free advice to the town&#39;s rich curmudgeon, Ouiser, (&#34;I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;ve just been in a bad mood for forty years&#34;); an eccentric millionaire, Miss Clairee, who has a raging sweet tooth; and the local social leader, M&#39;Lynn, whose daughter, Shelby (the prettiest girl in town), is about to marry a &#34;good ole boy.&#34; Filled with hilarious repartee and not a few acerbic but humorously revealing verbal collisions, the play moves toward tragedy when, in the second act, the spunky Shelby (who is a diabetic) risks pregnancy and forfeits her life. The sudden realization of their mortality affects the others, but also draws on the underlying strength-and love-which give the play, and its characters, the special quality to make them truly touching, funny and marvelously amiable company in good times and bad.</p><p></p><h2>Black Horses for the King (Magic Carpet Books)</h2><p>Galwyn, the son of a bankrupt and dishonored aristocrat, has always had an ear for languages. So when Lord Artos&#x2014;later known as King Arthur&#x2014;needs an interpreter to help him buy large horses to breed a troop strong enough to carry armed warriors against the Saxon invaders, Galwyn gets a chance to redeem his father&#x2019;s honor and make a name for himself. <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Includes an author&#x2019;s note..</strong></i><strong><br></strong></p><p>Anne McCaffrey is back with this precious, well-researched yarn that follows a Celtic lad in service to King Arthur. Set in fifth-century Britain, McCaffrey's first historical novel for young adults rejects a fantastical, Hollywood treatment of King Arthur in favor of realism and solid storytelling. Take away the Round Table and the usual knights-in-shining-armor hoo-hah, and you're left with an engaging, endearing chapter from the life of Artos, <i>Comes Britannorum</i>, a young war leader in search of horses strong enough to carry his armored warriors into battle against the savage Saxons.<p> The story is told through the eyes of polite, earnest young do-gooder Galwyn Varianus, who has fled the service of his cruel, brutish, seafaring uncle to take up with the charismatic Artos. Galwyn quickly proves his value with his affinity for languages and horses, and he accompanies Artos and the <i>Companions</i> (proto-Knights of the Round Table) as they execute their plan: acquiring and then breeding a handful of fabled <i>Libyans</i>, the horses of the book's title, and then mastering and disseminating the knowledge of horseshoe-making. The action revolves around Galwyn's role in this plan and never rises above the pace of, say, an after-school special. But rich details, McCaffrey's obvious love of the subject matter, and involving characters go a long way to make up for the story's slow trot. (In particular, you'll find yourself waiting eagerly for the comeuppance of one character, a sneering rider named Iswy, Goofus to Galwyn's Gallant.) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Anne McCaffrey is best known for the dragons she invented in her Dragonriders of Pern series. What many people don't know is that her first love was for horses--and it still is! A number of years ago, she realized her dream of building a horse farm, and each year I go to visit her in Ireland, I see improvements and get the guided tour of all the horses. This last visit, Anne showed me where some of her most beloved horses are buried--and I was moved at how choked up she got just pointing out the spot (and a gorgeous spot it is, too, with views across the fields down to the Irish Sea). So it was no surprise to me when Anne wrote Black Horses for the King, a tale of King Arthur from the point of view of the boy who helped him build his cavalry and brought the art of farriery (shoeing horses, for those who aren't familiar with the term) to the British Isles. Anne even ran her own farriery school in Ireland for a while. So I know that the details in this book are correct, and the subject is about as near and dear to the author's heart as one could get.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor<br></p><h2>Venus</h2><p><br>Suzan-Lori Parks continues her examination of black people in history and stage through the life of the so-called "Hottentot Venus," an African woman displayed semi-nude throughout Europe due to her extraordinary physiognomy; in particular, her enormous buttocks.

Spanning the personal, the political and the philosophical, it includes never-before-published speeches and a major new essay about the effect of today's populist movements on the future of global democracy. Edited and with an introduction by the columnist's son, Daniel Krauthammer, it is the most intimate and profound book yet by the legendary writer and thinker.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In his decades of work as America's preeminent political commentator, Charles Krauthammer elevated the opinion column to a form of art. Whether writing about statecraft and foreign policy or reflecting on more esoteric topics such as baseball, spaceflight and medical ethics, Krauthammer was beloved not only for his penetrating wit and insight but also for his ability to identify the hidden moral truths that animate our politics and culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>This new collection, which Krauthammer composed before his death in June 2018, features the columns, speeches and unpublished writings that showcase the best of his original thought and his last, enduring words on the state of American politics, the nature of liberal democracy and the course of world history.<br>&nbsp;<br>The book also includes a deeply personal section offering insight into Krauthammer's beliefs about what mattered most to him--friendship, family and the principles he lived by--all anchored by Daniel Krauthammer's poignant eulogy for his father.<br>&nbsp;<br>For longtime readers and newcomers alike, <i>The Point of It All</i> is a timely demonstration of what it means to cut through the noise of petty politics with clarity, integrity and intellectual fortitude. It is a reminder of what made Charles Krauthammer the most celebrated American columnist and political thinker of his generation, a revealing look at the man behind the words and a lasting testament to his belief that anyone with an open and honest mind can grapple deeply with the most urgent questions in politics and in life.</p><p><b>Charles Krauthammer,</b>&nbsp;winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a syndicated columnist, political commentator, physician and bestselling author.

It was a noisy and boisterous entry, as befits a 10-�pound Krauthammer. It has been just as noisy and boisterous since. I had been warned by friend and foe that life would never be the same. They were right.<br><br>Of course, like all exhausted newborn fathers, I am just looking for sympathy. It is my wife, Robyn, whose life has been fully merged with his, in a symbiosis profound and delicate. His sucking, did you know, causes the uterus to contract and helps shrink it back to normal size. Twenty days old, and he is healing&nbsp;her.<br><br>What she does for him, of course, would not fit in a month&#x2019;s worth of columns. What do I do? It seems my job is to father, a verb which must count as one of the age&#x2019;s more inventive creations. How exactly to father? I don&#x2019;t really know. The women&#x2019;s movement, to which the idea owes its currency, is right to insist that the father do&nbsp;more.<br><br>But more of what? I have been asking myself that lately as I rock him and hold him and speak to him in the gravest of tones. But we both know, we all three know, the truth: Nature has seen to it that anything I can do, she can do better. Mine is literally a holding action.<br><br>Of course, the imperative to father is only the last of the social conventions one must bend to on the road to parenting. (I am learning the language.) First, there is Lamaze, the classes that teach you to be natural. Robyn does not fancy oxymorons. And I, as a former psychiatrist, know a placebo when I see one. We said no to Lamaze.<br><br>We said yes to the Volvo. In fact, on the Volvo we went all the way. We got the station wagon with roof rack: the ultimate yuppie conveyance. &#x201c;For safety reasons only,&#x201d; I explain to friends, a protest that meets with knowing smiles.<br><br>Finally, there is the supreme modern convention: the now-�absolute requirement that father, in surgical gear, attend the birth. Of course, you don&#x2019;t have to if you don&#x2019;t want to. You can, if you wish, wait outside, like Dagwood Bumstead, pacing and smoking and fretting until it&#x2019;s over. You have the perfect right to betray your wife, spurn your child and disgrace your sex. It&#x2019;s a free country.<br><br>The transformation of expectant father from nuisance&#x2014;�packed off to boil water, find towels and generally get out of the way&#x2014;� to conscripted co-�producer of the birth epic is one of the anthropological wonders of the age. And on the whole, apart from the coercion, a good thing. Father&#x2019;s presence serves two purposes. One is to reduce the anguish of the mother. The other is to increase the anguish of the father. Both seem to me laudable goals. It makes up a bit for the extraordinarily unfair imbalance of suffering that attends childbirth.<br><br>Thank God, the new convention does not (yet) command fathers to attend a caesarean delivery. I speak from experience. Robyn needed a caesarean and, hoping I could comfort her, I was with her in the operating room. I was not looking for a Maslovian peak-�experience, the kind of epiphany that reputedly accompanies the moment of birth. I was doubtful, not just because of my usual skepticism, but because of my previous career. In medical school, I had assisted at several births, including a couple of caesareans, and always had trouble seeing the poetry for the blood.<br><br>There was little poetry this time either. It was an agonizing hour for her, and for me. (Daniel did very well.) The poetry came afterward, in the recovery room, where I found Daniel asleep in Robyn&#x2019;s&nbsp;arms.<br><br>It has been poetry and reverie ever since. Having a child, I discovered, makes you dream again and, at the same time, makes the dreams utterly real. Lately I have been dreaming of the future. I find entirely new meaning in what we in Washington call &#x201c;out-�years.&#x201d; Take 1989, the year the budget deficit comes down to $100&nbsp;billion. A time far, far away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until I figured it is the year when we retire Daniel&#x2019;s Pampers. A manageable deficit, only a few thousand nappy changes&nbsp;away.<br><br>Stranger years, years of exotic immensity, years that till now had meaning to Arthur C. Clarke only, become utterly mundane. 2001, the year of the mystical obelisk, and Daniel should be getting his learner&#x2019;s permit. 2010, the obelisk returns and Daniel is looking for a job. 2050, a year of unimaginable distance: his first Social Security check.<br><br>&#x201c;Checks? Social Security?&#x201d; my friend Pepe interrupts. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your imagination, man? They&#x2019;ll all be memories. Think big. 2050: the year he takes a sabbatical on Saturn.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m thinking small. I gaze at his body, so perfectly formed, so perfectly innocent. It has yet to be written on. I look at his knee and wonder where will be the little mark that records his first too-�hard slide into second&nbsp;base.<br><br>The Washington Post, June&nbsp;28, 1985</p><h2>The Shadow of the Sun</h2><p>In 1957, Ryszard Kapuscinski arrived in Africa to witness the beginning of the end of colonial rule as the first African correspondent of Poland&#39;s state newspaper. From the early days of independence in Ghana to the ongoing ethnic genocide in Rwanda, Kapuscinski has crisscrossed vast distances pursuing the swift, and often violent, events that followed liberation. Kapuscinski hitchhikes with caravans, wanders the Sahara with nomads, and lives in the poverty-stricken slums of Nigeria. He wrestles a king cobra to the death and suffers through a bout of malaria. What emerges is an extraordinary depiction of Africa--not as a group of nations or geographic locations--but as a vibrant and frequently joyous montage of peoples, cultures, and encounters. Kapuscinski&#39;s trenchant observations, wry analysis and overwhelming humanity paint a remarkable portrait of the continent and its people. His unorthodox approach and profound respect for the people he meets challenge conventional understandings of the modern problems faced by Africa at the dawn of the twenty-first century.</p><p>When Africa makes international news, it is usually because war has broken out or some bizarre natural disaster has taken a large number of lives. Westerners are appallingly ignorant of Africa otherwise, a condition that the great Polish journalist and writer Ryszard Kapu&#x153;ci�ski helps remedy with this book based on observations gathered over more than four decades.<p> Kapu&#x153;ci�ski first went to Africa in 1957, a time pregnant with possibilities as one country after another declared independence from the European colonial powers. Those powers, he writes, had "crammed the approximately ten thousand kingdoms, federations, and stateless but independent tribal associations that existed on this continent in the middle of the nineteenth century within the borders of barely forty colonies." When independence came, old interethnic rivalries, long suppressed, bubbled up to the surface, and the continent was consumed in little wars of obscure origin, from caste-based massacres in Rwanda and ideological conflicts in Ethiopia to hit-and-run skirmishes among Tuaregs and Bantus on the edge of the Sahara. With independence, too, came the warlords, whose power across the continent derives from the control of food, water, and other life-and-death resources, and whose struggles among one another fuel the continent's seemingly endless civil wars. When the warlords "decide that everything worthy of plunder has been extracted," Kapu&#x153;ci�ski writes, wearily, they call a peace conference and are rewarded with credits and loans from the First World, which makes them richer and more powerful than ever, "because you can get significantly more from the World Bank than from your own starving kinsmen."</p><p> Constantly surprising and eye-opening, Kapu&#x153;ci�ski's book teaches us much about contemporary events and recent history in Africa. It is also further evidence for why he is considered to be one of the best journalists at work today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#x201c;A highly detailed, heartfelt, but unsentimental introduction to Africa&#x2019;s afflictions and a quiet love song to its profound appeal.&#x201d; --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Ryszard Kapuscinski (Author of <i>The Emperor)<br><br></i>"The penetrating intelligence of Mr. Kapuscinski's vision and his knack for a kind of crystallized descriptive writing have never been on better display. . . . A marvel of humane, sorrowful and lucid observation." --<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Kapuscinski] has explored that sliver of high, thinly populated ground on which journalism and literature are occasionally joined. . . . A wise, engaging close-up filled with faces, landscapes, rutted roads, and the daily perils of African life." &#x2014;<i>BusinessWeek<br></i><br>&#x201c;[Kapuscinski's] great strengths are his style--candid, understated and slightly absurdist, veering into abrupt flights of lyricism on unexpected subjects--and his gift for picking out stories, that condense volumes of information into a single perfectly crafted passage." --<i>The Washington Post<br></i></p><h2>Frog and Toad All Year (I Can Read Book)</h2><p><p><strong>In winter, spring, summer, and fall, Frog and Toad are always together.

Translated from the French by the author. Reprinted with a new foreward by Jalal Toufic. "This book, a masterwork of the dislocations and radiant outcries of the Arab world, reaffirms Etel Adnan, who authored the great poem, Jebu, as among the foremost poets of the French Language. THE ARAB APOCALYPSE is an immersion into a rapture of chaos clawing towards destiny, and nullified hope refusing its zero. Is is also the journey of soul through the cartography of a global immediacy rarely registered by maps, replete with signposts like hieroglyphs in a storm of shrapnel and broken glass. And above all it is a book that, though capable of being read in its orderly sequence, has so surrendered to 'being there,' it can rivet the sensibility to the Middle Eastern condition at any point in the text--so rapid are its mutations, so becoming its becomingness--like a wisdom book or a book of Changes"--Jack Hirschman.<br><br>"It has a power and intensity that few poets today can muster&#x2014;only Allen Ginsberg's Howl comes to mind."&#x2014;Alice Molloy<br><br>"The power of Adnan's language and imagery reminds us that she is indeed one of the most significant post-modern poets in contemporary Arab culture."&#x2014;Kamal Boullatta<br><br>"THE ARAB APOCALYPSE is, to date, Adnan's most triumphant battle with the exactness of words."&#x2014;Douglas Powell<br><br>"The poem invokes a mythic past of Gilgamesh, Tammouz, and Ishtar to presage a present that resists narration, THE ARAB APOCALYPSE contests an uncritical reflection on the immediate historical past."&#x2014;Barbara Harlow</p><p>Etel Adnan was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1925, the daughter of a Greek Christian from Smyrna and a high- ranking Ottoman officer from Damascus. Her work as a whole is a faithful record of the times and places she has lived in Beirut, Paris, and in the San Francisco Bay Area. At least eighteen works by Adnan have been published in English. They include SITT MARIE ROSE (Post-Apollo Press, 1982); THE ARAB APOCALYPSE (Post-Apollo Press, 1989); SEA AND FOG (Nightboat Books, 2012), winner of the Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Poetry and the California Book Award for Poetry; and PREMONITION (Kelsey Street Press, 2014). Nightboat Books published the 2-volume set, TO LOOK AT THE SEA IS TO BECOME WHAT ONE IS: AN ETEL ADNAN READER, in 2014. In 2011, Adnan received Small Press Traffic's Lifetime Achievement Award. Her paintings, described by New York Times art critic Roberta Smith as "stubbornly radiant abstractions," have been widely exhibited, most recently at Documenta 13 and in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. Spanning media and genres, Adnan's writings have led to numerous collaborations with artists and musicians, including the French part of <em>CIVIL WarS</em>, a multi-language opera by American stage director Robert Wilson, performed in Lyon and Bobigny in 1985.the sun is a traitor traitor is the sun<p>FOR EVER <br>the sun spits the blood it sucked from scorpions <br>the sun drills holes in the brain of the Palestinian <br>the sun unites Arabs against the Arabs <br>the sun married its mother to better crucify its son... <br>History has pushed the accelerator of its power to infinity <br>villages fell as grains of dust roses are dynamos <br>the sun has emptied all courtyards</p><p>drank the water's fountain <br>Gilgamesh has razed the Walls the fields refuse to shelter the harvest <br>the sun has set on the banks of the Orontes and the Tigris for ever <br>Gilgamesh has returned in an airplane to water us with petroleum <br>We washed our eyes in the solar inferno <br>Blind are the Arab kings who howl in the night....</p></p><h2>Reasoning from the Scriptures with Catholics</h2><p><p>Anyone interested in sharing the gospel with Catholic friends or understanding where members of that denomination stand on important points of theology will appreciate this thorough yet easy-to-use reference.

It gives us renewed hope, by locating the &#34;problem of pain&#34; in a profoundly theological framework, in which ultimate resolution of the mystery of illness and suffering is provided by the healing touch of Christ Himself, the Physician of our souls and bodies. John Breck, from the Foreword Jean-Claude Larchet&#39;s The Theology of Illness, already translated into several languages, now appears in English and explores biblical and patristic perspectives on sickness and redemptive suffering. The questions Larchet considers are fundamental: the origins of sin in a fallen world, its impact on physical health, and the healing of human nature by the incarnate Son of God. He explains healing as a means of glorifying God, stressing again the crucial role of prayer and sacramental grace in promoting genuine health. When illness plunges us into unfamiliar territory, even to the point of death, Larchet teaches us to marshal spiritual reserves in a society dominated by technology and materialism. In a time when the physician has been dubbed the high priest of the god of Modern Medicine, Larchet encourages us to situate these crucial experiences within the framework of their relationship to the unique reality of the Holy Trinity.</p><p>Jean-Claude Larchet is an Orthodox layman and a professor of philosophy in a French lycee in Strasbourg</p><h2>Perrault&#39;s Fairy Tales (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Here are the original eight stories from the 1697 volume <i>Contes de temps pass�</i> by the great Charles Perrault (1628&#x2013;1703) in a translation that retains the charming and unsentimental simplicity that has won Perrault a permanent position in French literature. These were among the earliest versions of some of our most familiar fairy tales ("Cinderella," "Sleeping Beauty," "Little Red Riding Hood," "Puss in Boots," and "Tom Thumb") and are still among the few classic re-tellings of these perennial stories.<br>In addition to the five well-known tales listed above, Perrault tells three others that are sure to delight any child or adult: "The Fairies," a short and very simple tale of two sisters, one sweet and one spiteful; "Ricky of the Tuft," a very unusual story of a brilliant but ugly prince and a beautiful but stupid princess; and "Blue Beard," a suspense story perhaps more famous as a classic thriller than as a fairy tale. The witty verse morals that Perrault included in the original edition (often omitted in later reprintings) are retained here in verse translations.<br>This edition also includes 34 extraordinary full-page engravings by Gustave Dor� that show clearly why this artist became the foremost illustrator of his time. These illustrations have long been considered the ideal accompaniment to Perrault's fairy tales. In many cases they created the pictorial image that we associate with the stories.<br>Along with the collections of Andersen, Lang, and the Brothers Grimm, this volume is among the great books of European fairy tales. These stories have been enjoyed by generation after generation of children in many countries, and are here, with magnificent Dor� illustrations, waiting to be enjoyed again.</p><p>Here are the original eight stories from the 1697 volume Contes Du Temps Passe by the great Charles Perrault (1628-1703) in a translation that retains the charming and unsentimental simplicity that has won Perrault a permanent position in French literature.French illustrator Gustave Dor� (1833&#x2013;83) began his prolific career at the age of 15, and his dramatic engravings have exercised an incalculable influence over latter-day artists. The remarkable scope of his work ranges from Milton, Dante, and the Bible to Rabelais, Shakespeare, and street scenes of 19th-century London.</p><h2>This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don&#39;t Touch It (John Dies at the End, 2)</h2><p><p><b>From David Wong, the writer of the cult sensation <i>John Dies at the End,</i>omes another terrifying and hilarious tale of almost Armageddon at the hands of two hopeless heroes.</b></p><p>Warning: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR. </p><p> You will dismiss this as ridiculous fear-mongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fear-mongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection -- the creature stimulates skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That's just as well, since the "cure" involves learning what a chainsaw tastes like. You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed. </p><p> Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is <i>not</i> the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.</p><p>"Like an episode of AMC's "The Walking Dead" written by Douglas Adams of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." ...Imagine a mentally ill narrator describing the zombie apocalypse while drunk, and the end result is unlike any other book of the genre.

That actually made me want to act crazy, to impress him. Maybe that was his tactic. I thought, <i>maybe I should tell him I&#x2019;m the only person on Earth who has seen his entire skeleton.</i><br>Or, I could make something up instead. The therapist, whose name I had already forgotten, said, &#x201c;You believe your role here is to convince me you&#x2019;re not crazy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... you know I&#x2019;m not here by choice.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think you need the sessions.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand why the judge ordered it. I mean it&#x2019;s better than jail.&#x201d;<br>He nodded. I guess that was my cue to keep talking. Man, psychiatry seems like a pretty easy job. I said, &#x201c;A couple months ago I shot a pizza delivery guy with a crossbow. I was drunk.&#x201d;<br>Pause. Nothing from the doctor. He was in his fifties, but looked like he could still take me in a game of basketball, even though I was half his age. His gray hair was cut like a 1990&#x2019;s era George Clooney. Type of guy whose life had gone exactly as he&#x2019;d expected it. I bet he&#x2019;d never shot a delivery guy with a crossbow even once.<br>I said, &#x201c;Okay, I wasn&#x2019;t drunk. I&#x2019;d only had one beer. I thought the guy was threatening me and my girlfriend Amy. It was a misunderstanding.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He said you accused him of being a monster.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was dark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The neighbors heard you shout to him, and I&#x2019;m quoting from the police report, &#x2018;Go back to Hell you unholy abomination, and tell Korrok I have a lot more arrows where that came from.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... that&#x2019;s out of context.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So you do believe in monsters.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. Of course not. It was&nbsp;... a metaphor or something.&#x201d;<br>He had a nameplate on his desk: Dr. Bob Tennet. Next to it was a bobblehead of a St. Louis Cardinals baseball player. I glanced around the room, saw he had a leftover Halloween decoration still taped to his window, a cardboard jack-o&#x2019;-lantern with a cartoon spider crawling out of its mouth. The doctor had only five books on the shelf behind him, which I thought was hilarious because I owned more books than that and I wasn&#x2019;t even a doctor. Then I realized they were all written by him. They had long titles like <i>The Madness of Crowds: Decoding the Dynamics of Group Paranoia</i> and <i>A Person Is Smart, People Are Stupid: An Analysis of Mass Hysteria and Groupthink.</i> Should I be flattered or insulted that I apparently got referred to a world-class expert in the subject of why people believe in stupid shit?<br>He said, &#x201c;You understand, the court didn&#x2019;t order these sessions because you believe in monsters.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right, they want to make sure I won&#x2019;t shoot anyone else with a crossbow.&#x201d;<br>He laughed. That surprised me. I didn&#x2019;t think these guys were allowed to laugh. &#x201c;They want to make sure you&#x2019;re not a danger to yourself or others. And while I know it&#x2019;s counterintuitive, that process will actually be easier if you don&#x2019;t think of it as a test you have to pass.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But if I&#x2019;d shot somebody over a girl or a stolen case of beer, I wouldn&#x2019;t be here. I&#x2019;m here because of the monster thing. Because of who I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want to talk about your beliefs?&#x201d;<br>I shrugged. &#x201c;You know the stories that go around this town. People disappear here. Cops disappear. But I can tell the difference between reality and fantasy. I work, I have a girlfriend, I&#x2019;m a productive citizen. Well, not <i>productive</i>, I mean if you add up what I bring to society and what I take out, society probably breaks even. And I&#x2019;m not crazy. I mean, I know anybody can say that. But a crazy person can&#x2019;t fake sane, right? The whole point of being crazy is that you can&#x2019;t separate crazy ideas from normal ones. So, no, I don&#x2019;t believe the world is full of monsters disguised as people, or ghosts, or men made of shadows. I don&#x2019;t believe that the town of&#x2014;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>*The name of the town where this story takes place will remain undisclosed so as not to add to the local tourism traffic.*</i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>&#x2014;is a howling orgy of nightmares. I fully recognize that all of those are things only a mentally ill person believes. Therefore, I do not believe them.&#x201d;<br><i>Boom. Therapy accomplished.</i><br>No answer from Dr. Tennet. Fuck him. I&#x2019;ll sit like this forever. I&#x2019;m great at not talking to people.<br>After a minute or so I said, &#x201c;Just&nbsp;... to be clear, what&#x2019;s said in this room doesn&#x2019;t leave this room, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Unless I believe a crime is about to be committed, that&#x2019;s correct.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can I show you something? On my phone? It&#x2019;s a video clip. I recorded it myself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s important to you.&#x201d;<br>I pulled out the phone and dug through the menus until I found a thirty-second clip I&#x2019;d recorded about a month ago. I held it up for him to see.<br>It was a nighttime scene, at an all-night burrito stand near my house. Out front was a faded picnic table, a rusted fifty-five-gallon drum for a trash can and a whiteboard with prices scrawled in dry erase marker. Without a doubt the best burritos you can possibly get within six blocks of my house at four in the morning.<br>The grainy shot (my phone&#x2019;s camera wasn&#x2019;t worth a damn in low light) caught the glare of headlights as a black SUV pulled up. Stepping out of it was a young Asian man in a shirt and tie. He casually walked around the tiny orange building, nodding to the kid at the counter. He went to a narrow door in the rear, opened it and stepped inside.<br>After about ten seconds, the shot shakily moved toward the door. A hand extended into frame&#x2014;my hand&#x2014;and pulled the door open. Inside were some cardboard boxes with labels like LARGE LIDS and MED. PAPER BAGS&#x2014;WHITE along with a broom and a mop and bucket.<br>The Asian man was gone. There was no visible exit.<br>The clip ended.<br>I said, &#x201c;You saw it, right? Guy goes in, guy doesn&#x2019;t come out. Guy&#x2019;s not in there. He&#x2019;s not in the burrito stand. He&#x2019;s just <i>gone</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You believe this is evidence of the supernatural.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen this guy since then. Around town. This isn&#x2019;t some burrito shop Bermuda Triangle, sucking in innocent passersby. The guy walked right toward it, on purpose. And he came out somewhere else. And I knew he was coming, because he did the same thing, every night, at the same time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You believe there was a secret passage or something of the sort?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not a physical one. There&#x2019;s no hatch in the floor or anything. We checked. No, it&#x2019;s like a&nbsp;... wormhole or something. I don&#x2019;t know. But that&#x2019;s not even the point. It&#x2019;s not just that there was a, uh, magical burrito door there, or whatever it was, it&#x2019;s that <i>the guy knew what it was and how to use it</i>. There are people like that around town.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you believe these people are dangerous.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Jesus Christ, <i>I am not going to shoot him with a crossbow.</i> How can you not be impressed by this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s important to you that I believe you.&#x201d;<br>I just realized he was phrasing all of his questions as statements. Wasn&#x2019;t there a character in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> who did that? Did Alice punch him in the face?<br>&#x201c;Okay. I could have faked the video. You have the option of believing that. And man, if I could have that option, like if I could buy it from you, I&#x2019;d pay anything. If you told me you&#x2019;d reach into my brain and turn off my belief in all of this stuff, and in exchange I just had to let you, say, shoot me in the balls with one of those riot control beanbag guns, I&#x2019;d sign the deal right now. But I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That must be very frustrating for you.&#x201d;<br>I snorted. I looked down at the floor between my knees. There was a faded brown stain on the carpet and I wondered if a patient had once taken a shit in here in the middle of a session. I ran my hands through my hair and felt my fingers tighten and twist it, pain radiating down my scalp.<br><i>Stop it.</i><br>He said, &#x201c;I can see this is upsetting you. We can change the subject if you like.&#x201d;<br>I made myself sit up and take a deep breath.<br>&#x201c;No. This is what we&#x2019;re here to talk about, right?&#x201d;<br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s important to you.&#x201d;<br><i>Yes, in the way that the salt is important to the slug.</i><br>He said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s up to you.&#x201d;<br>I sighed, considered for a few beats, then said, &#x201c;One time, early in the morning, I was getting ready for work.

Arenas recounts a stunning odyssey from his poverty-stricken childhood in rural Cuba and his adolescence as a rebel fighting for Castro, through his supression as a writer, imprisonment as a homosexual, his flight from Cuba via the Mariel boat lift, and his subsequent life and the events leading to his death in New York. In what <b>The Miami Herald</b> calls his "deathbed ode to eroticism," Arenas breaks through the code of secrecy and silence that protects the privileged in a state where homosexuality is a political crime. Recorded in simple, straightforward prose, this is the true story of the Kafkaesque life and world re-created in the author's acclaimed novels.</p><p><b>Reinaldo Arenas</b> was born in Cuba in 1943. In 1980, he was one of 120,000 Cubans who arrived in the United States on the Mariel boatlift. Arenas settled in New York where he lived until his death from AIDS ten years later.INTRODUCTION<p>In May of 1980, the Cuban dissident poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943&#x2013;1990) arrived in Key West, Florida, after a harrowing five-day sea voyage on a pleasure craft named the <i>San L�zaro</i>. Having thus completed his own Mariel &#x201c;exodus&#x201d; that should have taken no more than seven hours, he expected to be welcomed by the American intellectual community that had hailed his works, published abroad while he was still in Cuba. He did not realize how parsimoniously the title of dissident was meted out to <i>foreign</i> authors (who ever heard of a dissident American author?) by the U.S. intellectual community and its publishers. Throughout the 1960s, &#x2019;70s, and &#x2019;80s, &#x201c;dissident&#x201d; was a term customarily restricted to certain, and only certain, Soviet and Eastern European authors, the qualifications for which have never been revealed by Washington insiders or the then budding media conglomerates. Latin American authors were not dissidents but &#x201c;exiles.&#x201d; Cuban exiles, Haitian exiles, Dominican exiles, Chilean exiles, Argentine exiles. Manuel Puig (Argentina) was not a dissident writer; Milan Kundera (Czechoslovakia) was. Likewise, Solzhenitsyn (USSR); but not Manlio Argueta (El Salvador). And especially not Cubans, writers or otherwise&#x2014;</p><p><i>Gusanos</i> (worms), <i>escoria</i> (dregs), <i>agentes del CIA</i> (CIA agents), perhaps. Reinaldo did not know that in America he would become, not a celebrity, but an invisible man; that he would vanish, disappear.</p><p>There is an old saying of the Cold War, first told me by Carlos Franqui, one of the early revolutionaries who joined Fidel Castro in the Sierra Maestra, to organize and direct Radio Rebelde: &#x201c;In Communism and in Capitalism, they kick you in the ass,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But the difference is, under Communism, you have to smile and say, Thank you; whereas under Capitalism, at least you can scream.&#x201d; Well, Reinaldo Arenas had come to scream...</p><p>In time, of course, Arenas would learn that when you scream without a microphone, nobody hears you, except maybe the next-door neighbor, who calls the landlord who calls the police, to have you evicted from your 43rd Street, rat-infested, New York City apartment. In the meantime, professors at famous American universities began expunging his novels from their syllabuses. Newspapers would select reviewers who had just come back from their latest two-week junket in Havana, all expenses paid by the Revolution, to learn how Utopia thrived in &#x201c;the first free territory of the Americas.&#x201d; While Reinaldo was living in a police-patrolled, rent-controlled Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen apartment, the neighboring <b>New York Times</b> published a Sunday magazine cover story on &#x201c;Revolution and the Intellectual in Latin American.&#x201d; The theme of the piece was, of course, Fidel Castro&#x2019;s Cuban Revolution, its pros and cons in the minds of the Latin American intelligentsia. Incorporating extended interviews with, among other authors, Garc�a M�rquez of Colombia (pro-Fidel), Octavio Paz of Mexico (anti-Fidel), and Julio Cort�zar of Argentina (frequent-flier on <i>Cubana de Aviaci�n</i>, though his books never accompanied him), the most telling aspect of the entire piece was what was <i>un</i>told, naturally. Not a single Cuban intellectual, either inside or outside of Cuba, had been asked his opinion on the subject. Reinaldo wrote a letter of protest to the editor, which was never published. He did not exist.</p><p>In Germany, one of Arenas&#x2019;s publishers sponsored a Latin American festival, to coincide with the Frankfurt Book Fair of 1985, to which neither he, nor the Cuban novelist and essayist Guillermo Cabrera Infante (also in exile, and under contract to the same publisher) were invited. One of the editors of the publishing house was, yes, traveling back and forth to Cuba, learning about the Revolution. It seems that <i>UNEAC</i> (the Union of Cuban Writers and Artists) had insisted it would only send its authors if no were invited. None were, but the promised shipment of genuine intellectual <i>puros</i> never showed up either. As Cabrera Infante would say, <i>Holy Smoke!</i></p><p>Curiously, even the published versions of Reinaldo&#x2019;s&#x2014;</p><p>and Guillermo&#x2019;s&#x2014;</p><p>works became extremely difficult to find. Their Spanish publisher &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t give them away.&#x201d; Still, when bookstores ordered copies, they consistently received notices that the publisher was &#x201c;temporarily out of stock.&#x201d; Arenas had also been told by his French publisher, shortly after his escape from Cuba, that his translator (the most famous in all of France) was just too busy to translate his remaining works; a few years later Reinaldo received a disheartened letter from that same translator asking why, after so many years of faithful service, the author had no longer wanted him as his translator. Reinaldo screamed. Nobody heard...</p><p>How different it had been in Cuba. In 1965, a then twenty-two-year-old Reinaldo Arenas had won second prize for the manuscript of his first novel, <b>Celestino Before Dawn</b>, in an annual competition for best fiction sponsored by <i>UNEAC</i> in Havana. With a truly incantatory blend of the prosaic and the lyrical, a young boy &#x201c;sings&#x201d; the tale of his own awakenings, sexual and poetic, to the world about him through the irreverent promptings of his (imagined?) cousin Celestino. The novel would be published in 1967, selling out within a week, but would never be reissued inside of Cuba again. (It was eventually rewritten in exile as <b>Singing from the Well</b>. The first version is rumored to have been recently republished in Havana.)</p><p>In 1966, heralded as a young prodigy of the Revolution and acknowledged by such luminaries as the Cuban literary &#x201c;giant,&#x201d; Jos� Lezama Lima, for the baroque pyrotechnics of his style, his wit and (more discreetly) his libido, Arenas improvidently entered the manuscript of a second novel in the next annual competition. Improvidently, because with <b>Hallucinations</b> he quite daringly recast the life of the historical Fray Servando into fiction, updating this Mexican <i>p�caro&#x2019;s</i> exploits with salacious detail and political innuendo.</p><p>On December 12, 1794, the iconoclastical friar, Servando Teresa de Mier (1763&#x2013;1827), renowned for the brilliance of his oratory, his wit, and his intellect, had delivered a heretical sermon at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The heresy was in suggesting, however obliquely, that the aboriginal Americans might have already been blessed with a good Christian &#x201c;education&#x201d; prior to the Spanish Conquest&#x2014;</p><p>by the Apostle Thomas, whom Servando believed to be revered by the Aztecs as <i>Quetzalcoatl</i> (the Plumed Serpent). Immediately, the incorrigible Servando was banished to Spain, tried, and imprisoned. The balance of his life was spent in jail or in flight, harassed by the Holy Inquisition, hounded by the Spanish authorities, escaping dungeons, wandering in exile. The infamous sermon had wreaked havoc on the course of his life, though fortunately it would provoke his final revenge: the writing of his fantastic memoirs.</p><p>His, too, had been an age of revolutions (1776, in America; 1789, in France) and conflicting fanatical fervors, throughout Europe and Latin America. The powers of the Catholic Church and the Spanish Empire had been foundering on both continents. There were many Inquisitions, not all of them religious. Eighteenth-Century Rationalism, in its quest for ideological Purities (whether atheistic or clerical, republican or monarchical), seemed bent upon cleansing the Body Politic of the Past, or of the Future.</p><p>Arenas&#x2019;s astonishing fictionalization of Servando&#x2019;s life in his <b>Hallucinations</b> did win him another &#x201c;second&#x201d; prize&#x2014;</p><p>but, this time, as something of an anomaly: there would be no first prize. Two jurors (one of them, the Cuban poet Vergilio Pi�era) had voted in favor of his novel; two jurors (one of them, the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier) had voted against it. The irony was that, despite his strong objections to the Arenas manuscript, Carpentier could find no substitute worthy of the prize. Yet, so great was the venerable novelist&#x2019;s prestige (Had not Fidel appointed him cultural attach� to an embassy in Paris?), or perhaps his spite (Was he not the inventor of &#x201c;marvelous reality&#x201d; in fiction?), that with a simple wave of his magical-realist baton he liquidated the category: <b>Hallucinations</b> was awarded &#x201c;first honorable mention.&#x201d;</p><p>Never published in Cuba, it had to be smuggled abroad. Translations of the novel soon appeared, to critical acclaim, in half a dozen languages. In France, it was nominated for another prize&#x2014;</p><p>the Prix M�dicis, for best foreign novel of the year (1969). Here was a brilliantly inventive, comic novel written by a Latin American Gorky, a Cuban peasant raised from the stark brutality of his impoverished childhood in rural Oriente Province, from an island once ruled by a capitalist dictator he had helped to overthrow, joining the rebels in the Sierra Maestra as a young teenager, a rural foundling whom now the Cuban revolution had generously lifted out of ignorance and, behold: turned into a <i>writer</i>!</p><p>Meanwhile, at home curious things began to happen to Reinaldo Arenas, the writer, who could no longer publish in Cuba. Like Fray Servando before him, he found himself caught in an age of wars and revolutions, militant fervors and fanatical conflicts of ever spiraling dimensions. For here was another man of letters from another splendid Age&#x2014;</p><p>that of Twentieth-century Progress&#x2014;</p><p>who had too late realized that the old Colonial Spanish interdiction against fiction (and <i>Eros</i>) in the New World, had yet to be lifted in his utopian <i>Caribe</i> paradise. &#x201c;You and I are the same person,&#x201d; he had prophetically warned Fray Servando, in a prefatory letter to <b>Hallucinations</b>&#x2014;</p><p>or warned himself.</p><p>In 1970, Arenas was sent by UNEAC as a military recruit to a rural sugar mill, where he was expected to make his contribution to Fidel Castro&#x2019;s improbable goal of a ten-million-ton harvest by cutting cane and writing a book in praise of the experience. Instead, he composed the furiously inspired rebuttal to that inhuman experiment: <b>El Central (A Cuban Sugar Mill)</b>, which was also smuggled out of the country. It was during this period that the idea of a <i>pentagon�a</i> began also to mature in the author&#x2019;s mind: five novels or &#x201c;agonies,&#x201d; each depicting the life of a poet, who would live, write, suffer, and die, only to be reborn in the following novel. Together they would comprise &#x201c;the secret history of Cuba.&#x201d; Arenas had nothing but contempt for &#x201c;visible&#x201d; history, as blind as &#x201c;a file of more or less chronologically ordered manila folders.&#x201d;</p><p>The first volume (<b>Singing from the Well</b>), the poet as inspired wild-child, had already been written and published as <b>Celestino</b>. The second volume, <b>The Palace of the White Skunks</b>, smuggled out in 1972, recounts the adolescent dreams of a sexually ambivalent Fortunato, raised in a house of frustrated aunts, a tyrannical mother, and two ferociously primal grandparents. When the family abandons the farm and moves to Holgu�n, where his furiously taciturn grandfather hopes to open a grocery to put some food on the table, Fortunato decides to join the rebels in the Sierra Maestra, only to be captured while clumsily attempting to wrest a rifle from a Batista recruit, after which he is tortured and executed by government soldiers on the eve of the Revolution&#x2019;s (January, 1959) triumph. Here, Arenas has created a haunting family portrait, combining the lyrical empathy of a Tennessee Williams toward his characters&#x2019; troubled lives with a radically fractured narrative that pays dark tribute, less to Faulkner than to the schizophrenia of life under any dictatorial extreme.</p><p>The third volume, <b>Farewell to the Sea</b>, is arguably Reinaldo&#x2019;s finest novelistic achievement within the <i>Pentagon�a</i>. It had to be written three times, the first in 1969, when it was destroyed by a friend who was supposed to be hiding it away, chapter by chapter, as Reinaldo wrote it. A second version was confiscated by the authorities in 1972; and the present version, smuggled out in 1974, while Reinaldo was in prison. It was published in a (purposefully?) mangled and truncated version in Spain, in 1982, which quickly went out of print. There eventually followed an incompetently translated and dreadfully edited version in France, in 1987, which languished for years in a prohibitively expensive edition. That same year saw an English edition of the work come out here in the States, in Andrew Hurley&#x2019;s magisterial translation. Until quite recently, this was the only readable&#x2014;</p><p>or available&#x2014;</p><p>version of the work in any language.</p><p>The final draft of the novel inevitably reflected Arenas&#x2019;s growing desperation, as a writer and as a homosexual. He had been arrested in the summer of 1973, on trumped up charges of &#x201c;seducing minors.&#x201d; The experience is related factually in his memoirs <b>Before Night Falls</b>, and comically fictionalized in <b>The Color of Summer</b>, the fourth volume of the <i>Pentagon�a</i>. Suffice it to note that the two masculine minors, who had actually stolen Arenas&#x2019;s underwater gear at the beach, turned out to be well-above age and recanted their testimony at the trial. A contemptuous judge still managed to find him guilty of counterrevolutionary activities, in part through Arenas&#x2019;s <i>UNEAC</i> file (signed by, among other cultural commisars, the Cuban poet Nicol�s Guill�n) which confirmed that he had smuggled unauthorized manuscripts out of the country. After a bizarre escape (rivaling even Fray Servando&#x2019;s bravado) from the local prison near the beach, he was finally recaptured and sent to various prisons and forced-labor camps (for &#x201c;re-educating&#x201d; homosexuals), including the notorious El Morro prison, where his semi-fictional mentor had been imprisoned two centuries earlier.</p><p><b>Farewell to the Sea</b> is set, like the previous novel, on the eve of an anticipated triumph that will produce unmitigated disaster: Fidel&#x2019;s trumpeted goal, for 1970, of the ten-million ton harvest. The novel is completely divided, one might say severed, into two parts: the second part composed of six furious cantos, sung in silence to the ocean by Hector, a poet who no longer writes, or is no longer allowed to, away on a six-day vacation at the beach. He has endured the forced-labor of the cane fields as a &#x201c;volunteer.&#x201d; He has entered a sham-marriage (though the union is not devoid of genuine, sometimes heartbreaking affection), and even fathered a child, in order to avoid the charge of homosexuality. At the beach he has an affair with a young boy who on the sixth day mysteriously drowns. The first part of the novel is told in prose by Hector&#x2019;s wife, who genuinely loves him but does not seem to be his intellectual or emotional equal. She often feels awkward with him; he rarely talks to her anymore, finds her mawkish and sentimental. She recognizes intuitively what he is, but is still hopelessly drawn to him, perhaps in part because of the very horror of the death-in-life that totalitarianism has imposed upon them both. And yet, in her silent musings&#x2014;</p><p>upon the ocean, the beach, the groves of trees, the flight of birds, and even the young boy who has seduced (is seduced by?) her husband&#x2014;</p><p>which fill the six days of their holiday, she ...</p></p><h2>Betsy Ross: Designer of Our Flag (Childhood of Famous Americans)</h2><p>Recreates the childhood of the woman traditionally remembered as the maker of the first American flag, which was secretly presented to General George Washington in Philadelphia in 1776.</p><p>Anne Weil was the author of <i>Eleanor Roosevelt: Fighter for Social Justice, Betsy Ross: Designer of Our Flag, </i>and<i> Red Sails to Capri,</i> which was a 1953 Newbery Honor Book.</p><h2>The Great Acceleration: An Environmental History of the Anthropocene since 1945</h2><p><p>The Earth has entered a new age&#x2015;the Anthropocene&#x2015;in which humans are the most powerful influence on global ecology. Since the mid-twentieth century, the accelerating pace of energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and population growth has thrust the planet into a massive uncontrolled experiment. <i>The Great Acceleration</i> explains its causes and consequences, highlighting the role of energy systems, as well as trends in climate change, urbanization, and environmentalism.</p><p>More than any other factor, human dependence on fossil fuels inaugurated the Anthropocene. Before 1700, people used little in the way of fossil fuels, but over the next two hundred years coal became the most important energy source. When oil entered the picture, coal and oil soon accounted for seventy-five percent of human energy use. This allowed far more economic activity and produced a higher standard of living than people had ever known&#x2015;but it created far more ecological disruption.</p><p>We are now living in the Anthropocene. The period from 1945 to the present represents the most anomalous period in the history of humanity&#x2019;s relationship with the biosphere. Three-quarters of the carbon dioxide humans have contributed to the atmosphere has accumulated since World War II ended, and the number of people on Earth has nearly tripled.

Even though I have lived all my life in Sk&#x152;ne, where fog is forever closing in and shutting out the world, I&#x2019;ll never get used to it.<br><br>9 p.m., October 11, 1993.<br><br>Fog came rolling in from the sea. He was driving home to Ystad and had just passed Br?sarp Hills when he found himself in the thick of the white mass.<br><br>Fear overcame him right away.<br><br>I&#x2019;m frightened of fog, he thought. I should be scared of the man I have just been to see at Farnholm Castle instead. The friendly man whose menacing staff always lurk in the background, their faces in the shadows. I should be thinking about him and what I now know is hidden behind that friendly smile. His impeccable standing in the community, above the very least suspicion. He is the one I should be frightened of, not the fog drifting in from Han? Bay. Not now that I have discovered that he would not hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way.<br><br>He turned on the wipers to try to clear the windshield. He did not like driving in the dark. He particularly disliked it when rabbits scurried this way and that in the headlights.<br><br>Once, more than thirty years ago, he had run over a hare. It was on the Tomelilla road, one evening in early spring. He could still remember stamping his foot down on the brake pedal, but then a dull thud against the bodywork. He had stopped and got out. The hare was lying on the road, its back legs kicking. The upper part of its body was paralyzed, but its eyes stared at him. He had had to force himself to find a heavy stone from the verge, and had shut his eyes as he threw it down onto the hare&#x2019;s head. He had hurried back to the car without looking again at the animal.<br><br>He had never forgotten those eyes and those wildly kicking legs. The memory kept coming back, again and again, usually at the most unexpected times.<br><br>He tried now to put the unpleasantness behind him. A hare that died all of thirty years ago can haunt a man, but it can&#x2019;t harm him, he thought. I have more than enough worries about people still in the land of the living.<br><br>He noticed that he was checking his rearview mirror more often than usual.<br><br>I&#x2019;m frightened, he thought again, and I have only just realized that I am running away. I am running from what I know is hidden behind the walls of Farnholm Castle. And they know that I know. But how much? Enough for them to be afraid that I&#x2019;ll break the oath of silence I once took as a newly qualified lawyer? A long time ago that was, when an oath was just that: a sacred commitment to professional secrecy. Are they nervous about their old lawyer&#x2019;s conscience?<br>Nothing in the rearview mirror. He was alone in the fog, but in under an hour he would be back in Ystad.<br><br>The thought cheered him, if only for a moment. So they weren&#x2019;t following him after all. He had made up his mind what he was going to do tomorrow. He would talk to his son, who was also his colleague and a partner in the legal practice. There was always a solution, that was something life had taught him. There had to be one this time too.<br><br>He groped on the unlit dashboard for the radio. The car filled with a man&#x2019;s voice talking about the latest research in genetics. Words passed through his brain without his taking them in. He checked his watch: nearly 9:30. Still no one behind him, but the fog seemed to be getting even thicker. Nevertheless, he pressed down on the accelerator a little harder. The further he was from Farnholm Castle, the calmer he felt. Perhaps, after all, he had nothing to fear.<br><br>He forced himself to think clearly.<br><br>It had begun with a perfectly ordinary telephone call, a message on his desk asking him to contact a man about a contract that urgently needed verifying. He did not recognize the name, but had taken the initiative and made the call: a small law practice in an insignificant Swedish town could not afford to reject a potential client. He could recall even now the voice on the phone: polite, with a northern accent, but at the same time giving the impression of a man who measured out his life in terms of what each minute cost. He had explained the task, a complicated transaction involving a shipping line registered in Corsica and a number of cement cargoes to Saudi Arabia, where one of his companies was acting as an agent for Skanska. There had been some vague, passing reference to an enormous mosque that was to be built in Khamis Mushayt. Or maybe it was a university building in Jeddah.<br><br>They had met a few days later at the Continental Hotel in Ystad. He had arrived there early, and the restaurant was not yet open for lunch; he had sat at a table in the corner and watched the man arrive. The only other person there was a Yugoslav waiter staring gloomily out of the window. It was the middle of January, a gale was blowing in from the Baltic, and it would soon be snowing. But the man approaching him was suntanned. He wore a dark blue suit and was definitely no more than fifty. Somehow, he did not belong either in Ystad or in the January weather. He was a stranger, with a smile that did not belong to that suntanned face.<br><br>That was the first time he had set eyes on the man from Farnholm Castle. A man without baggage, in a discrete world of his own, in a blue, tailor-made suit, everything centering on a smile, and an alarming pair of shadowy satellites buzzing attentively but in the background.<br><br>Oh yes, the shadows had been there even then. He could not recall either of them being introduced. They sat at a table on the other side of the room, and rose without a word when their master&#x2019;s meeting was over. <br><br>Golden days, he thought, bitterly, and I was stupid enough to believe in it. A lawyer&#x2019;s vision of the world should not be influenced by the illusion of a paradise to come, not here on earth at least. Within six months the suntanned man had come to be responsible for half of the practice&#x2019;s turnover, and in a year the firm&#x2019;s income had doubled. Bills were paid promptly, it was never necessary to send a reminder. They had been able to afford to redecorate their offices. The man at Farnholm Castle seemed to be managing his business in every corner of the world, and from places that seemed to be chosen more or less at random. Faxes and telephone calls, even the occasional radio transmission, came from the strangest-sounding towns, some he could only with difficulty find on the globe next to the leather sofa in the reception area. But everything had been aboveboard, albeit complex.<br><br>The new age has dawned, he remembered thinking. So this is what it&#x2019;s like. As a lawyer, I have to be grateful that the man at Farnholm picked my name from the telephone book.<br><br>His train of recollections was cut short. For a moment he thought he was imagining it, but then he clearly made out the headlights in the rearview mirror.<br><br>They had crept up on him.<br><br>Fear struck him immediately. They had followed him after all. They were afraid he would betray his oath of silence.<br><br>His first reaction was to accelerate away through the fog. Sweat broke out on his forehead. The headlights were on his tail. Shadows that kill, he thought. I&#x2019;ll never get away, just as none of the others did.<br><br>The car passed him. He caught a glimpse of the driver&#x2019;s face, an old man. Then the red taillights vanished into the fog.<br><br>He took out a handkerchief and wiped his face and neck.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll soon be home, he thought. Nothing is going to happen. Mrs Dun?r has recorded in my diary that I was to be at Farnholm today. Nobody, not even he, would send his henchmen to kill off his own elderly lawyer on the way home from a meeting. It would be far too risky.<br><br>It was nearly two years before he first realized that something untoward was going on. It was an insignificant assignment, checking contracts that involved the Swedish Trade Council as guarantors for a considerable sum of money. Spare parts for turbines in Poland, combine harvesters for Czechoslovakia. It was a minor detail, some figures that didn&#x2019;t add up. He thought it was probably a misprint, maybe somewhere two digits had been muddled. He had gone through it all again and realized that it was no accident, it was all intentional. Nothing was missing, everything was correct, but the upshot was horrifying. His first instinct had been not to believe it. He had leaned back in his chair&#x2013;it was late in the evening, he recalled&#x2013;taking in that there was no doubt that he had uncovered a crime. It was dawn before he had set out to walk the streets of Ystad, and by the time he reached Stortorget he had reluctantly accepted that there was no alternative explanation: the man at Farnholm Castle was guilty of a gross breach of trust regarding the Trade Council, of tax evasion, and of a whole string of forgeries.<br><br>After that he had constantly been on the lookout for the black holes in every document emanating from Farnholm. And he found them&#x2013;not every time, but more often than not. The extent of the criminality had slowly dawned on him. He tried not to acknowledge the evidence he could not avoid registering, but in the end he had to face up to the facts. But on the other hand he had done nothing about it. He had not even told his son. Was this because, deep down, he preferred to believe it wasn&#x2019;t true? Nobody else, apparently not even the tax authorities, had noticed anything. Perhaps he had uncovered a secret that was purely hypothetical? Or was it that it was all too late anyway, now that the man from Farnholm Castle was the principal source of income for the firm?<br><br>The fog was more or less impenetrable now. He hoped it might lift as he got nearer to Ystad.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t go on like this, that was certain. Not now that he knew that the man had blood on his hands.<br><br>He would talk to his son. The rule of law still applied in Sweden, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, even though it seemed to be undermined and diluted day by day. His own complaisance had been a part of that process. His having turned a blind eye for so long was no reason for remaining silent now.<br><br>He would never bring himself to commit suicide.<br><br>Suddenly he saw something in the headlights. He slammed on the brakes. At first he thought it was a hare. Then he realized there was something in the road.<br><br>He turned on his brights.<br><br>It was a chair, in the middle of the road. A simple kitchen chair. Sitting on it was a human-sized effigy. Its face was white.<br><br>Or could it be a real person made up like a tailor&#x2019;s dummy?<br><br>He felt his heart starting to pound. Fog swirled in the light of his headlamps. There was no way he could shut out the chair and the effigy. Nor could he ignore his mounting fear. He checked his rearview mirror. Nothing. He drove slowly forward until the chair and the effigy were no more than ten meters from the car. Then he stopped again.<br>The dummy looked impressively like a human being. Not just some kind of hastily put-together scarecrow. It&#x2019;s for me, he thought. He switched off the radio, his hand trembling, and pricked up his ears. Fog, and silence. He didn&#x2019;t know what to do next.<br><br>What made him hesitate was not the chair out there in the fog, nor the ghostly effigy. There was something else, something in the background, something he couldn&#x2019;t make out. Something that probably existed only inside himself.<br><br>I&#x2019;m very frightened, he said to himself, and fear is undermining my ability to think straight.<br><br>Finally, he undid his seat belt and opened the door. He was surprised by how cool it felt outside. He got out, his eyes fixed on the chair and the dummy lit up by the car&#x2019;s headlights. His last thought was that it reminded him of a stage set with an actor about to make his entrance.<br><br>He heard a noise behind him, but he didn&#x2019;t turn. The blow caught him on the back of his head.<br><br>He was dead before his body hit the damp asphalt.<br><br>It was 9:53 p.m. The fog was now very dense.</p><h2>Double Deuce (Spenser)</h2><p>Hawk wants Spenser to wage war on a street gang. Susan wants Spenser to move in with her. Either way, Spenser&#39;s out of his element. So why not risk both?</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Spenser and Hawk take on a black street-gang while, on the domestic front, Susan persuades Spenser to move in: more hard- boiled mystery with a runny yolk from the ever-entertaining Parker. After some good-natured haggling, Spenser's dark-side alter- ego Hawk agrees to pay the Boston shamus a third of what he's getting--``nothing''--to free a decayed ghetto housing project from the ``Hobarts,'' the violent drug-dealing youth gang that controls it utterly; and, at the same time, to bring to justice whoever-- most likely a Hobart--gunned down a 15-year-old and her infant daughter at the project. With Hawk as guide, then, Spenser enters the forbidding world of gangs, marveling at their colorful slang and ritualized ways, meditating--with input from a saintly youth worker--on their hopeless lives...which gets him to thinking a lot about Hawk and the cruel sacrifices the black bermensch made to escape the ghetto. Spenser's longtime girlfriend Susan thinks about that, too, while monitoring how her experiment in domesticating the p.i. is faring--not too well, actually, despite all the usual lovingly described scenes of cooking and soulful cooing between the two: Spenser is pacing like a caged tiger. Meanwhile, the gang's leader has fixed on Hawk as a kind of father figure, but one he'll have to slay (``Hawk, you and me the same,'' he says. ``It got to be done we step up. Ain't afraid to be killing, ain't afraid to be dying'') unless Hawk kills him first. The inevitable showdown is pure adrenaline--and the subsequent avenging of the murders, plus Spenser's dignified coming to terms with Susan, pure satisfaction. Nothing new, just Parker marking perfect time: Spenser fans will love it. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Today, though, I felt free and whimsical and impulsive. All the moms in my neighborhood had told me there were great bargains inside the old warehouse. I needed no bargains. Adam and I could afford whatever we wanted. With the income of two physicians&#x2014;a pediatric orthopedist and an anesthesiologist&#x2014;money had never been our problem. It wasn't until I stepped inside the building, the scent of lemon oil enveloping me, that I realized why I was there. I remembered Katie Winston, one of the women in my North Raleigh neighborhood book club, talking about the beautiful nursery furniture she'd found inside. Katie had been pregnant with her first child at the time. Now she was expecting her third. <em>I'll finally fit in, </em>I thought, as I walked into the building's foyer, where the concrete floor was layered with old Oriental rugs and the walls were faux painted in poppy and gold.<br><br>Every single one of the fifteen women in my book club had children except for me. They were always warm and welcoming, but I felt left out as their conversations turned to colic and day care and the pros and cons of Raleigh's year-round school program. They thought I didn't care. Being a doctor set me apart from most of them to begin with, and I was sure they believed I'd chosen career over motherhood. Every one of them was a stay-at-home mom. Most had had short careers before getting pregnant, and a couple still did some work from home, but I knew they saw me outside their circle. They had no idea how much I longed to be one of them. I kept those feelings to myself. Now, though, I was ready to let them out. I'd tell my neighbors at our next meeting. I hoped I could get the words out without crying.<br><br>Today marked sixteen weeks. I rested my hand on the slope of my belly as I walked down the aisle on the far left of the building, past cubicles filled with beautiful old furniture or handcrafted items. I was safe. <em>We </em>were safe. Most people waited until the first trimester had passed to tell people the news, but Adam and I had learned that even reaching the twelve-week mark wasn't enough. I'd made it to twelve weeks and two days the last time. We'd wait four months this time, we'd decided. Sixteen weeks. We wouldn't tell anyone before then&#x2014;except Rebecca, of course&#x2014;and we wouldn't start fixing up the nursery until we'd passed that sixteen-week milestone.<br><br>Smiling to myself, I strolled calmly through the building as though I was looking for nothing in particular. Some of the cubicles were filled with a hodgepodge of goods, crammed so tightly together I couldn't have walked inside if I'd wanted to. Others were a study in minimalism: shelves set up just so, each displaying a single item. Some of the cubicles had shingles in the entryway to give the appearance of a shop on a quaint street corner instead of a small square cubby in a warehouse. Rustler's Cove. Angie's Odds 'n' Ends. North Carolina Needlepoint. There were few other shoppers, though, and absolutely no one who appeared to be guarding the merchandise. If you wanted to slip a knickknack into your pocket, there was no one to see. No one to stop you. That sort of trust in human nature filled me with sudden joy, and I knew my hormones were acting up in a way that made me giddy I ran my fingertips over a smooth polished tabletop in one cubicle, then fingered the edge of a quilt in the next. I passed one tiny cubby that contained only a table with a coffeepot, a plate of wrapped blueberry muffins, a small sign that read <em>Coffee: Free, Muffins: $1.50 each </em>and a basket containing six dollar bills. I couldn't resist. I took two of the muffins for tomorrow's breakfast and slipped a five-dollar bill into the basket. I walked on, the irrational joy mounting inside me. People could be trusted to pay for their muffins. What a wonderful world!<br><br>I felt like calling Adam just to hear his voice. How long since I'd done that? Called him for no reason? I hadn't seen him before he left for the hospital that morning, and I'd spent the day seeing patients in my office. If all went well with Adam's surgeries today, he'd be home in time to go out to eat. We could celebrate the sixteen-week milestone together. The baby was due New Year's Day. What could be more fitting? The start of a new year. A new life for all three of us. Things would be better with Adam now. Ever since learning I was pregnant, there'd been a tension between us that we hadn't really acknowledged because we didn't know how to get rid of it. If I was being honest with myself, I had to admit the tension had been there much longer than that. Now, though, I was sure it would disappear. We'd talk at dinner that evening, our future finally full and glowing ahead of us. Maybe we'd make lists of names, something we hadn't dared to do before now. Then we'd go home and make love&#x2014;<em>really </em>make love, the way we used to before all our lovemaking had turned into baby making. Once upon a time, we'd been good together in bed. I wanted that back.<br><br>I saw a sign hanging from a cubicle several yards in front of me. <em>BabyCraft, </em>it read, and I walked straight toward it. This was the place Katie had mentioned, I was sure of it. The lemony scent grew strong as I walked inside the rectangular cubicle. It was filled with furniture, but there was order to the layout. White cribs and dressers and gliders on one side, espresso-colored cribs and changing tables and rockers on the other. I shivered with anticipation, unsure what to look at first. Tags hung from each piece of furniture, telling me the original pieces had been refinished to meet twenty-first-century safety requirements. Lead paint removed. Crib bars moved closer together. The pieces were exquisite. Although Adam and I had held back from turning one of the bedrooms into a nursery, we'd already planned everything to the final detail, lying awake at night, talking. How many men would take that much interest? It had been easier to imagine the mural we'd have painted on the nursery wall than it was to imagine the baby. That would change now.<br><br>I spent nearly an hour in the broad cubicle, typing notes into my BlackBerry about the furniture. Prices. Contact information for the BabyCraft shop owner. Everything. And finally, reluctantly, I walked on. I couldn't buy anything. Not yet. I wasn't ready to tempt fate.<br><br>I'd be nearly thirty-five when the baby was born. I would have preferred to have my first earlier, but I didn't care at this point<em>. My first. </em>There would be more to come, at least one more baby to use the furniture. Maybe two. <em>Maybe a houseful, </em>I thought, the giddiness returning.<br><br>***<br><br>Adam called on my cell when I walked into the house.<br><br>"Going to be a long night," he said. "Couple of emergency surgeries, and I'm it. You doing okay?"<br><br>"I'm great," I said as I slid open the back door to let Chaun-cey into the yard, spotting the four deer munching our azaleas a second too late. Chauncey tore down the deck steps, barking his crazy head off, and I laughed as the deer raised their indifferent eyes in his direction. They knew he wouldn't take a step past the invisible fence.<br><br>"What's with Chaunce?" Adam asked.<br><br>"Deer," I said, leaving out the part about the azaleas. Adam thought the deer were funny and beautiful until it came to the yard. "You'll get something to eat at the hospital?" I asked, knowing our celebration would have to wait until the following night.<br><br>"Right." He paused for a moment. "I'll be working with Lisa tonight," he said, referring to one of the surgeons who was a good friend of both of ours. "Can I tell her about the Pollywog?"<br><br>I smiled. The baby would have his last name&#x2014;Pollard&#x2014;and he'd started calling him or her "the Pollywog" a couple of weeks ago. I knew then that he was confident everything would go well this time. I felt the slightest twinge of anxiety over him telling Lisa, but tamped it down. It was time to let the world share our happiness. "Absolutely," I said.<br><br>"Great, My." I could hear the grin in his voice. "Let's stay up late tonight and talk until dawn, okay?"<br><br><em>Oh, yes. </em>"I can't wait," I said.<br><br>I fed Chauncey and ate a salad, then went upstairs to sit in the room that would become the nursery. The only piece of furniture currently in the room was a rocker. That was one thing we wouldn't need to buy, and if our battered old rocker didn't match the rest of the BabyCraft furniture, I didn't care. It was the rocking chair of my childhood. My mother had nursed and cuddled both Rebecca and myself in that rocker. It was one of the few pieces of furniture I owned that had belonged to my parents. Rebecca had none of it, of course. She lived in an apartment on the second floor of Dorothea Ludlow's Durham Victorian, and her furniture was slapped together from whatever she could find. She was rarely there and couldn't have cared less, but I wished we'd had the foresight to keep more of our parents' belongings. We'd been teenagers then, and furniture had been the last thing on our minds. It was only because the social worker had told us we'd one day appreciate having the rocker that we kept it, too numb to argue with her.<br><br>Sitting in the rocker, I imagined the BabyCraft furniture in the room. It would fit perfectly and still leave space for the mural on one wall. I rested my hands on my stomach. "What do you think, little one? Mammals? A Noah's ark kind of thing? Or fish? Birds?" <em>I'm dreaming, </em>I thought. How long had it been since I'd let myself dream?<br><br>"You're a rarity," Adam had told me early on, when we were still new to each other and everything about our relationship seemed to sparkle. "Part doctor, part dreamer. A scientist and a romantic, all in one endearing package." Oh, how right he'd been, and what an uneasy blend of traits that could be at times. I could see myself as a stay-at-home mom like so many of my neighbors, my life filled easily and completely with the needs of my children. Yet I loved the challenge of my work. I knew I would find a way to do both. My plan for the next five months was to keep working, stopping as close to my delivery as possible as long as everything went well with my pregnancy. <em>Sixteen weeks. </em>I was going to be fine.<br><br>***<br><br>The streets of our neighborhood were deserted as I walked Chauncey before bed. The full moon was veiled by thin gray clouds and a fine mist fell, weaving itself into my hair. It had been a wet August. As we walked beneath a streetlamp, I saw Chauncey's fur glow with tiny damp droplets. The houses were set far apart on the winding, sidewalkless streets, and they were a mix of styles. Brick colonials, like ours, and cedar-sided contemporaries. Woods divided one lot from another, and the trees hugged the road between the houses. Usually Adam was with us for this late-night outing, and walking through the darkness in our perfectly safe neighborhood still sent a shiver through me. Chauncey was a big dog, though. A hundred pounds. Some mix of Swiss Mountain dog and German shepherd, perhaps. He was dark and fierce looking with the personality of a lamb. He was wonderful with kids, and that had been the most important criterion when we found him at the SPCA three years earlier. We hadn't realized then that the wait for those kids would be this long.<br><br>The pain was so subtle at first that another woman might not have noticed it. But I'd felt that pain before, the fist closing ever so slowly, sneakily around my uterus.<br><br>I stopped in front of a long stretch of fir trees. "Oh, no," I whispered. "No. Go away."<br><br>Chauncey looked up at me and I pressed my hand to my mouth, all of my being tuned to that barely perceptible pain.<br><br>Was it gone? I focused hard. Maybe I'd imagined it. Maybe just a twinge from the walk? Maybe some stomach thing?<br><br>Chauncey leaned against my leg and I rested my hand on top of his broad head. I thought of walking home very slowly, but my feet were glued to the road. There it was again. The sly, sneaky fist.<br><br>My fingers shook as I reached for my BlackBerry where it was attached to my waistband. If the surgery was over, Adam would pick up. But when I lifted the phone, it was my sister's number I dialed.<br><br>***<br><br>"Do you even know how many of the men at this conference you've slept with?" Dorothea looked around the massive hotel restaurant and Rebecca followed her gaze with annoyance.<br><br><em>"What?" </em>she said. "Dot, you're so full of it. I've slept with exactly one. Brent."<br><br>She could see Brent, sandy haired and tan, sitting with a group of people at a table not far from where she and Dorothea were eating dinner. He looked like an aging beach bum, though she knew his coppery skin was from the sun in Peru, where he'd been working in a village devastated by a mudslide and not from lazy days on the beach. She'd known him for years. Her stomach didn't exactly flip with desire at the sight of him, but she felt the sort of warmth you'd feel when you caught a glimpse of a good friend.<br><br>"I don't mean this week." The end of Dorothea's long gray braid brushed precariously close to her plate. "I mean, of the couple hundred men at this conference, how many have you slept with over the years?"<br><br>"Is that a serious question?" Rebecca rubbed her bare arms. She'd worked out for nearly an hour in the hotel's health club that morning and her muscles had the tight achiness she relished. "Why on earth do you care?" She was crazy about Dorothea Ludlow, but the woman could be such a snark.<br><br>"I'm just curious. Your libido's always amazed me. You're like a well that's impossible to fill."<br><br></p><h2>Presstitutes Embedded in the Pay of the CIA: A Confession from the Profession</h2><p>The eagerly awaited English edition of "Bought Journalists" was suppressed for three years under the title "Journalists for Hire" -- and still got 24 five-star-only Amazon reviews from would-be readers. 18 months on the bestseller list in Germany. Now it's finally here!<p>Ever get the feeling the media tries to manipulate or lie to you? You have plenty of company! And you are right -- the facts are in. A world-class media insider has blown the whistle on what really goes on inside the media industry.</p><p>Author Udo Ulfkotte was a respected journalist for 17 years with Germany's newspaper of record, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He begins this explosive expos� by first owning up to his own career, where he had to sell out to have the job. He then reveals the deceptive tricks and secret networks of power within the media. How perks are used to bribe journalists and opinion makers to twist their reporting. How the tone of corruption is set from the top -- play along or quit. How the long arm of the NATO press office enrolls the media to get Europe to support more foreign wars. </p><p>Ulfkotte names hundreds of names and gives you a behind-the-scenes look at the organizations that influence the German media with one-sided propaganda, such as The Atlantic Bridge, Trilateral Commission, German Marshall Fund, CFR, and Aspen Institute. He unmasks the intelligence agencies behind these lobbies groups and the propaganda techniques they use, such as US Embassy grants for projects to influence European public opinion. </p><p>When the CIA holds the hand that holds the pen </p><p>Would you be surprised to learn that spies sit and write articles in newspaper editorial offices? Which are then published on op-ed pages under the names of well-known journalists? Or which journalists receive bribes for their reporting? Have you heard how prestigious "journalism prizes" are a reward system for cooperation? Much as "Heroes of Labor" were honored for writing the best communist propaganda in the former East bloc. Seen from the inside, the difference between journalist and propagandist isn't as far as you might like. </p><p>The elite owners of the media feel it's their right to think for us, and to mold public opinion to their agendas. Their Freedom of the Press is Freedom to Censor the news. </p><p>Our nation depends on the media to understand our world, just as each one of us depends on our eyes and ears. The media are our senses. When they hide the truth, or lie to us, they put us all in danger. </p><p>A million people died in Iraq, Libya and Syria because the press didn't just report the news, didn't just lie about the news, but they invented and sold the events that served as pretexts for wars. The author spent years in the Middle East, surviving an attack with chemical weapons supplied by US and German firms. </p><p>This book is a veteran's guide to the media spider's web. It shows how the system works, sharpens your common sense skepticism, and increases your immunity to the controlled media's attempts to do our thinking for us. </p><p>You will gain a whole new perspective on media reports. A good idea of how much you can believe the news on TV or the radio: almost nothing. Ulfkotte dissects the German media establishment, which media outlets are owned by political parties, the journalists that are under their influence, and what keeps them there. You will see how whole countries are manipulated &#x2013; and who is pulling the strings and why. Here is the bad news about the news: our idea of a free press with a broad spectrum of opinion is pure fantasy. Very often, what is called the "news" is simply brainwashing.</p></p><p></p><h2>Persepolis Box Set (Pantheon Graphic Library)</h2><p><b>Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood</b><br><br>Wise, funny, and heartbreaking, <i>Persepolis</i> is Marjane Satrapi&#x2019;s memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah&#x2019;s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran&#x2019;s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.<br><br><i>Persepolis</i> paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane&#x2019;s child&#x2019;s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, <i>Persepolis</i> is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.<br><b>Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return</b><br><br>Here is the continuation of Marjane Satrapi's fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.<br><br>Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.<br><br>As funny and poignant as its predecessor, <i>Persepolis 2</i> is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism. In its depiction of the struggles of growing up&#x2014;here compounded by Marjane&#x2019;s status as an outsider both abroad and at home&#x2014;it is raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating.</p><p><b>Marjane Satrapi</b>&nbsp;was born in Rasht, Iran. She now lives in Paris, where she is a regular contributor to magazines and newspapers throughout the world, including&nbsp;the<i> New Yorker&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;the<i> New York Times.</i>&nbsp;She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Persepolis, Persepolis 2, Embroideries, Chicken with Plums,&nbsp;</i>and several children's books. She cowrote and codirected the animated feature film version of&nbsp;<i>Persepolis,&nbsp;</i>which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature."A memoir of growing up as a girl in revolutionary Iran, <i>Persepolis</i> provides a unique glimpse into a nearly unknown and unreachable way of life... That Satrapi chose to tell her remarkable story as a gorgeous comic book makes it totally unique and indispensable."<br>--<i>Time</i></p><h2>A House of Tailors</h2><p>SEWING! NO ONE could hate it more than Dina Kirk. <br><br>Endless tiny stitches, button holes, darts. Since she was tiny, she&#x2019;s worked in her family&#x2019;s dressmaking business, where the sewing machine is a cranky member of the family.<br><br>When 13-year-old Dina leaves her small town in Germany to join her uncle&#x2019;s family in Brooklyn, she turns her back on sewing. Never again! But looking for a job leads her right back to the sewing machine. Why did she ever leave home? Here she is, still with a needle and thread&#x2014;and homesick to boot. <br><br>She didn&#x2019;t know she could be this homesick, but she didn&#x2019;t know she could be so brave either, as she is standing up to an epidemic or a fire. She didn&#x2019;t know she could grow so close to her new family or to Johann, the young man from the tailor&#x2019;s shop. And she didn&#x2019;t know that sewing would reveal her own wonderful talent&#x2014;and her future. <br><br>In Dina, the beloved writer <b>Patricia Reilly Giff</b> has created one of her most engaging and vital heroines.

I could hear the pop-pop-pop of the cannons.<br><br>Inside was the sewing room. Gray cloth forms of Mama's clients stood along one wall, reminding me of the soldiers we saw on the streets outside, but without their spiked helmets, of course, or their splendid blue tunics with the gold trim.<br><br>War! How exciting it was. Our own German soldiers from the Fifth Infantry Regiment had swarmed into our sleepy little town, determined to take on the French who lived just on the other side of the Rhine River.<br><br>And that sparkling river flowed so close to our front door I could have tossed a stone from my window and seen the ripples it made in the water.<br><br>I didn't care two pins about our Otto von Bismarck and his determination to unite all of Germany in this war. What difference could it possibly make to me?<br><br>But I did love to think about those soldiers, who looked so fierce and elegant . . . and who wandered up and down the street so close to the sewing room that I was tempted to tap on the window with my thimble and wave to them.<br><br>Mama would have had a fit!<br><br>Being a soldier would certainly be better than sitting here in this room sewing buttons on Frau Ottlinger's winter bodice--ten brass buttons from collar to waist--running the thread through the tallow to give it strength.<br><br>Frau Ottlinger, Mama's most important client, thought she was going to be a fashion plate this Christmas, dressed in the style of those infantrymen. She was more likely to look like a breakfast bun studded with raisins.<br><br>"Dina!" Mama said. Even with her back turned she knew my mind was wandering. And I knew exactly what she was going to say next: "Christmas is almost upon us, and we have dozens of orders still to fill!" As she spoke, she rubbed the already spotless sewing machine wheel with a soft cloth.<br><br>That sewing machine! It was like a cranky member of the family that had to be cleaned, and polished, and fed with oil whenever I turned around. And every two minutes it seemed we had to put a new piece of felt underneath to save the rose rug from being worn away. <br><br>Today there was a fire in the grate, and smoky lanterns for light--smoky because I had forgotten to wash them. Mama had swished the curtains closed in anger at the first burst of gunfire. "These dresses must be finished tonight," she had said to my sister, Katharina, and me. "Pay no attention to those ruffians out there."<br><br>Anyone who disturbed Mama was a ruffian.<br><br>Luckily the curtains were opened the width of one of Mama's business cards: Frau Kirk and Daughters--Tailors. I could see part of our little southern German town of Breisach nestled between the mountains and the river, and once in a while a cannon flash as our soldiers fired across that river at the French.<br><br>France would be defeated, we knew that. Someone had told Mama the French had no harnesses for their horses, no bullets, and, worse, they were fighting smallpox, a disease so terrible it made me shiver to think about it.<br><br>Poor Elise, my French friend for so many years. She lived on the other side of the river, and we had met at a fall festival in happier times, when we were less than ten years old. How often on early sunny mornings we rowed back and forth across the river to trade patterns, and cookies, and gossip.<br><br>Mama leaned over me now. "Those buttonholes look like cabbage heads."<br><br>I looked down guiltily.<br><br>Mama took the bodice and my needle. Carefully she made invisible blanket stitches around the edges of the top hole, filling in the space to make it smaller. "You know how to do this as well as I do." She patted my shoulder. "You are thirteen years old. Stop dreaming. We have no time for it."<br><br>Stop dreaming. Stop thinking. I stretched my cramped fingers. I remembered the first buttonholes I had made at the age of four, practicing on a piece of toweling, first Mama, then Katharina showing me patiently. How many buttonholes had I made since then? A thousand?<br><br>Mama was sympathetic. "I know it takes forever to do all those buttons when you'd rather be--"<br><br>Reading the letter that's propped up on the fabric table was what I wanted to say. "Having morning muffins," I said instead so that I wouldn't be accused of having more curiosity than Ksnig, our cat.<br><br>My eyes kept going to the letter that had arrived this morning: a tissue-thin envelope covered with stamps from America. Mama had said, "I'm too busy adding the braid to Frau Ottlinger's skirt to open it. It has nothing to do with you anyway, Dina." But she smiled to take the sting out of her words.<br><br>And my older sister, Katharina! She didn't have as much curiosity as the piece of tailor's chalk on the table. With barely a glance at the letter, she had picked up a package of flannel sheets, neatly hemmed, and gone out the back door to deliver them to a family on Mettau Street.<br><br>I was on the fifth button, holes newly drawn in, when at last Mama stood up, arching her back and running her hands over her waist as she left the sewing room for the kitchen. I'd have about three minutes alone while she stirred the soup and added the marrow balls she had prepared an hour ago.<br><br>Out of my chair in an instant, I picked up the letter, which crackled in my hand, and tried to read the words through the envelope.<br><br>In my mind was a picture of the uncle who had sent it: Mama's rich older brother, who lived in luxury. No wonder! Everyone who lived in Brooklyn, New York, probably did. After his first wife died, he had married again and sailed immediately for America. How romantic it was. I hadn't seen him since I was a little girl, but I imagined him handsome and funny, and the young second wife, Barbara, slim and lovely.<br><br>I held the letter up, turning it one way and then another. The name Katharina jumped out at me. "Katharina," I said aloud. "What is he saying about Katharina?"<br><br>And I was caught, of course.<br><br>Mama plucked the letter from my hand.<br><br>"Well, what do you think it says?" I asked.<br><br>"I know what it's about," Mama said, "and Katharina does, too."<br><br>"Why don't I know? Why is it that everything is kept from me?"<br><br>Mama shook her head impatiently. "Nothing can be kept from you for very long." She sighed. "My brother is offering Katharina a place with him and his wife."<br><br>I sank down on the chair, my heart thumping in my chest. "And I? Will I go with her?"<br><br>Mama shook her head. I could see she felt a little sorry for me. "Only Katharina."<br><br>Katharina to go to America! I loved my older sister; she was my best friend.

After a year apart, and an ill-fated affair with the Winter Street Inn's old Santa Claus, Mitzi has returned to rule the roost; Patrick is about to be released from prison; Kevin has a successful new business and is finally ready to tie the knot with Isabelle; and best of all, there's hopeful news about Bart, who has been captured by enemy forces in Afghanistan. <br><br>That doesn't mean there aren't a few dark clouds on the horizon.

In 2008, Brigit Pegeen Kelly was awarded the 2008 Academy Fellowship from the Academy of American Poets. Her work has appeared in many anthologies and literary magazines, including The Nation, The Yale Review, New England Review, Poetry, The Antioch Review, The Massachusetts Review, The Southern Review, five Pushcart Prize volumes, and six volumes of The Best American Poetry. Kelly, who has taught for many years primarily at the University of Illinois, has also taught at the University of California at Irvine, Purdue University, Warren Wilson College, and numerous writers&#39; conferences. In 2002 the University of Illinois awarded her both humanities and campus-wide awards for excellence in teaching.Kelly has won some of the most prestigious awards available to poets, among them the Yale Series of Younger Poets award in 1988 for To the Place of Trumpets (LJ 5/15/88) and now the Lamont Award of the Academy of American Poets for her current volume. The title poem is an absolute gripper: a haunting story of the sacrificial mutilation of a child's pet goat that finally attains an arresting, spellbinding, ghostly immortality. This opening poem is a hard act to follow, but Kelly keeps the interest high. Descriptions are vivid and indelible as Kelly skillfully captures the elusive nature of sights, sounds, odors, and taste ("The window opens. The smell and even taste of wetted dirt and wild fruit steps/Up"). A strong thread of spirituality is woven into almost all the poems, which move from reflections on a flock of wild turkeys to Botticelli's St. Sebastian. Kelly is far from a minimalist-her poems are long-lined and full of rich, compelling words-but she is never wordy-and she truly deserves the recognition she has received.

On the rain-drenched trail to the&nbsp;&nbsp;lawless town of Seven Pines, Hopalong discovers two men&#x2014;one dead, the other badly wounded. Returning&nbsp;&nbsp;with medical help, Hopalong finds the wounded man&nbsp;&nbsp;has been shot through the temple. Who would&nbsp;&nbsp;commit such a murder? To find out, Hopalong hires on&nbsp;&nbsp;at Bob Ronson's Rocking R Ranch. There he learns&nbsp;&nbsp;that more than a thousand cattle have been run off&nbsp;&nbsp;by men keeping one scheming eye on the ranch and&nbsp;&nbsp;the other on the monthly stagecoach shipments of&nbsp;&nbsp;gold. Hopalong is determined to stop those&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible. But even the best gunfighter needs men he&nbsp;&nbsp;can trust to watch his back, men willing to risk&nbsp;&nbsp;their lives to do what's right. With their help,&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopalong fights to save the Rocking R, only to&nbsp;&nbsp;find himself the target of a ruthless gunman in a life-and-death struggle for frontier justice.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> TWO DEAD MEN<br> &nbsp;<br> Hopalong Cassidy stopped his white gelding on the bald backbone of the ridge. No soil covered the windswept sandstone, only a few gnarled cedars that seemed, as is their way, to draw nourishment from the very rock itself. In this last hour before sunset the air was of startling clarity, so much so that objects upon the mountainside across the valley stood out, clearly defined as though but a few yards away instead of as many miles.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where he sat the sun was bright, but in the west, which was his direction, towering masses of cumulus piled to majestic heights, dwarfing the mountains to insignificance. The crests of the mighty clouds were glorious with sunlight, but the flat undersides were sullen with impending rain. Hopalong squinted appraisingly at the sky and became no happier at what he saw.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven Pines, proudly claiming title as the toughest town west of anywhere, was a good twelve miles off, hidden in the mountains across the valley. Long before he could ride a third of that distance those clouds would be giving the valley a thorough drenching. What he needed now was shelter, and he needed it badly.<br> &nbsp;<br> So it was that he sat in his saddle studying the country with careful eyes. The stage route was but a mile or so to the north, but he had heard of no shelter there and so far his information had been most accurate. Even as he watched, the gigantic cloud moved nearer, lightning stabbed through it, and the thunder rolled and grumbled.<br> &nbsp;<br> To the south and west the valley narrowed before spewing out into the vast waste of Adobe Flat. Waterless most of the time, after a rain it would become a slippery, greasy surface that concealed unexpected sinks and mud traps. Close by, the mountainside was broken and serrated, carved by upheaval and erosion. There were notches among the rocks in some of the canyons, but they might well prove deathtraps in such a storm as this would be. Hopalong Cassidy had lived too long in the West not to realize the danger that lay in the bottoms of canyons and dry washes. It was such a sudden rush of water that had finally ended his feud with Tex Ewalt and brought them together as friends, but more often than not, it meant only death to the unwary traveler.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, as he was about to ride on, a movement caught his eye and he drew up sharply. From the mouth of a canyon below and to the southwest a small group of riders had emerged. Something in their bunched way of riding warned Cassidy, and he kneed his mount to the partial concealment of a juniper. At this distance even his field glasses offered him no marks of identification, save a single white splotch on the flank of one horse and that same horse&#x2019;s white nose. There were six riders, and they moved north at a rapid pace, keeping close to the mountain and choosing a route that offered cover from view.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He watched them until they disappeared, scowling slightly, for he knew this land in which he lived. Although a stranger in this area, he was far from strange to the West and western ways, and it seemed these men were riding on a mission. A mission that demanded they remain hidden from anyone passing down the stage-coach road.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, Topper,&#x201d; Hopalong said quietly to the short-coupled gelding, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s ride along and see what happens. It&#x2019;s a cinch they know where there&#x2019;s shelter. They won&#x2019;t like to get wet any more than we do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The white horse moved along, choosing its own trail, heading down and northward on a slant. With another appraising glance at the cloud, much nearer now, Hopalong Cassidy drew his six-shooters one after the other and carefully wiped them free of dust. They were worn silver-plated Colt .45&#x2019;s, their bone handles networked with tiny cracks, their balance perfect. It had been weeks since he had drawn a gun for any reason, but he knew that the price of safety was unresting vigilance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven Pines was his immediate destination, but actually he was just roving across the country. Somewhere to the north, an old friend of the cattle trails, Gibson of the old 3 T L, had a ranch where he lived with his widowed daughter. Hopalong planned to stop with them for a few days before swinging northeast into Montana.<br> &nbsp;<br> The presence of the riders, even while it promised the proximity of shelter, disturbed him. He had no desire to walk into a range war or any trouble whatsoever. This ride of his was strictly a sightseeing trip, taken with money in his pocket and no feeling of hurry.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few spattering drops of rain struck his hat brim, sweeping it with a hasty barrage. Hopalong frowned and dug for his slicker, donning it without slowing his pace. By now he was off the ridge and well into a stand of cedar, his eyes busy searching for shelter. Once he glimpsed an old mine dump, but the tunnel was long since caved in and the buildings had collapsed.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he reached the vague trail skirting the foot of the mountain he found the tracks of the bunch ahead of him. He studied the tracks briefly, reading them as easily as another man might read a page of print. These were fresh horses, well shod, but one horse had the hoof trimmed too narrow, causing him to toe in somewhat. Another dash of rain came, gained impetus, and then proceeded in a downpour that drew a gray veil across the desert and mountains. The sky darkened and the rolling clouds closed out the sun, shutting down all the miles before him with darkness and slashing rain.<br> &nbsp;<br> The gray streak of a trail led downward from the mine dump, offering a chance of speed, so he lifted the gelding into a canter and went down the mountain to the main road. Halting briefly, he again found the tracks of the riders. Not yet wiped out by the rain, they crossed the road and then ran along through the brush parallel to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The shower eased, and Hopalong smelled the old familiar odor that raindrops bring to long-dry dust. Then there was a crash of thunder and more rain, and behind the rain a roaring weight of wind. Now the darkness became absolute, without a chink of light anywhere except for the constant play of lightning. The wide valley was filled with sound, and the rain came down in solid sheets of water turned into a scythe driven by the fierce wind.<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned onto the stage road, and Topper held to his canter. Then suddenly the storm lulled, and down this hallway of silence Hopalong heard the sudden crash of shots!<br> &nbsp;<br> Two&nbsp;...&nbsp;three more, a light volley&nbsp;...&nbsp;and then one. The last was a lone, final shot. The ending of something.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reining in, Hopalong strained his ears against the sudden silence, listening. There was nothing, and then the rain came again, whispering at first, then mounting in crescendo to new heights of fury. Pushing on, his hat brim pulled low, his slicker collar high around his ears, he wondered at the shots. A cold drop fell down the back of his neck and found a trail down his spine. He shivered and strained his eyes into the blackness ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Riding suddenly onto the scene of a shooting was anything but smart, but this was new country to him, known only by hearsay, and if he got off the trail now he could easily wander out into the valley and become lost. Suddenly Hopalong felt the gelding&#x2019;s muscles tense and in a flash of lightning he saw its head come up sharply. At the same time Hopalong saw, on the trail ahead, a dark shape sprawled in the mud!<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing up, he waited for lightning. It came, and he stared beyond the man&#x2019;s body, but the trail was empty as far as he could see. Whatever had happened here was now over. Swinging down beside the fallen man, he turned him over. Rain splashed on a white, dead face and over a bullet-riddled body. One hole was in the head. Shielding a struck match, Hopalong&#x2019;s lips compressed. This man had been downed by the other shots, but the last one had been fired by a gun held against his skull, burning with its muzzle blast the hair and skin. Of this man they had made sure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quickly he went through the man&#x2019;s pockets, removing his wallet, papers, and what loose money he could find. These things should go to the man&#x2019;s relatives, if any, and would help serve as identification. In this rain they would soon become soaked and illegible unless protected.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dead man had made a try for his life. His pistol was gripped in his hand and one shot had been fired.<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing over him, oblivious of the rain, Hopalong studied the situation. The man had been removed from the stage, for he lay to one side of the trail, and it looked as if he had been given his chance, had taken it, and lost. Cut deeply into the trail were the tracks of the stage. &#x201c;Holdup,&#x201d; Hoppy muttered. &#x201c;This hombre either asked for a scrap or had it forced on him. One thing, he doesn&#x2019;t size up like any pilgrim. He&#x2019;d been to the wars before.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mounting, Hopalong rode up the trail a short distance, then stopped as a flash of lightning revealed yet another body. Swinging down, Hopalong bent to touch the man, and he groaned. Straightening up, Hopalong waited for another flash of light, then spotted a slight overhang in the rock of the cliff, an overhang that gave promise of growing deeper as the rock curved away from the trail.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Juana and Lucas</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Pura Belpr� Author Award</b><br><b><b><br></b>Fans of Judy Moody and Clarice Bean will love Juana, the spunky young Colombian girl who stars in this playful, abundantly illustrated new series.</b><br><br>Juana loves many things &#x2014; drawing, eating Brussels sprouts, living in Bogot�, Colombia, and especially her dog, Lucas, the best <i>amigo</i> ever.

Five unsolved murders. A hundred years of mystery. One sprawling conspiracy, one&nbsp;metropolis on the brink of the twentieth century, one bloody-minded Ripper ushering London into the modern age of terror, and one comics masterpiece.&nbsp;<i>From Hell </i>is now available in a handsome hardcover edition, with a brand new cover.</p><p>The mad, shaggy genius of the comics world dips deeply into the well of history and pulls up a cup filled with blood in <i>From Hell</i>. Alan Moore did a couple of Ph.D.'s worth of research into the Whitechapel murders for this copiously annotated collection of the independently published series. The web of facts, opinion, hearsay, and imaginative invention draws the reader in from the first page. Eddie Campbell's scratchy ink drawings evoke a dark and dirty Victorian London and help to humanize characters that have been caricatured into obscurity for decades. Moore, having decided that the evidence best fits the theory of a Masonic conspiracy to cover up a scandal involving Victoria's grandson, goes to work telling the story with relish from the point of view of the victims, the chief inspector, and the killer--the Queen's physician. His characterization is just as vibrant as Campbell's; even the minor characters feel fully real. Looking more deeply than most, the author finds in the "great work" of the Ripper a ritual magic working intended to give birth to the 20th century in all its horrid glory. Maps, characters, and settings are all as accurate as possible, and while the reader might not ultimately agree with Moore and Campbell's thesis, <i>From Hell</i> is still a great work of literature. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Alan Moore</b>&nbsp;is widely regarded as the best and most influential writer in the history of comics. His seminal works include&nbsp;<i>Miracleman&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>, for which he won the coveted Hugo Award.

Her short fiction appeared in <i>Seventeen, The Massachusetts Review, </i>and <i>The Colorado Review. </i>She lives year-round on Nantucket Island with her husband, Chip Cunningham, who manages the Cliffside Beach Club, and their son. <i>The Beach Club</i> is her first novel.Well-fit, great-looking hotel employees in Nantucket prowl for love..Everyone at the Nantucket Beach Club and Hotel this summer wants something, and wants it badly. The receptionist, Love, is so obsessed with getting pregnant that she sees each male guest as a potential sperm donor. Bill, who owns the place with his wife Therese, wants his 18-year-old daughter Cecily to agree to take over the hotel. But Cecily&#x2019;s one desire is to fly to Rio for a reunion with her well-endowed Brazilian boyfriend. For Therese, concerned about Bill&#x2019;s failing heart and dreading Cecily's impending independence, all would be well if only Cecily would marry Mack, the hotel's manager, who loves the Beach Club as if it were his own&#x2014;though he has a long-term girlfriend, Maribel, who is desperate for him to propose. On top of all this, the head bellman, Vance, having lost the manager's job to Mack 12 years ago, has marked this as the summer when he'll finally take his revenge. At the center of all the turmoil, easygoing Mack simply wants everyone off his back while he decides whether to make the alluring island his home or return to his farm in Iowa. With Maribel pursuing Mack, Jem (another bellman) pursuing Maribel, Vance pursuing Love, and Love pursuing everyone, the club is awash with hormones, and quarrels break from one minute to the next. The ever-changing cast of hotel guests&#x2014;a sexy suspected drug dealer, an extracurricular flame of Mack's, a generous dying man&#x2014;adds to the mix. After a crescendo that begins with Vance taking Mack's decision into his own hands and culminates with a hurricane that leaves the hotel engulfed in sand, the characters find all their obsessive needs gone&#x2014;carried off, as if by the wind&#x2014;letting peace reign. A feisty, evanescent first novel, lively enough to keep a sunbather awake.Literary Guild selection -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Combining political theory with ethnographic research among the Mohawks of Kahnaw�:ke, a reserve community in what is now southwestern Quebec, Audra Simpson examines their struggles to articulate and maintain political sovereignty through centuries of settler colonialism. The Kahnaw�:ke Mohawks are part of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy. Like many Iroquois peoples, they insist on the integrity of Haudenosaunee governance and refuse American or Canadian citizenship. Audra Simpson thinks through this politics of refusal, which stands in stark contrast to the politics of cultural recognition. Tracing the implications of refusal, Simpson argues that one sovereign political order can exist nested within a sovereign state, albeit with enormous tension around issues of jurisdiction and legitimacy. Finally, Simpson critiques anthropologists and political scientists, whom, she argues, have too readily accepted the assumption that the colonial project is complete. Belying that notion, <i>Mohawk Interruptus</i> calls for and demonstrates more robust and evenhanded forms of inquiry into indigenous politics in the teeth of settler governance.</p><p><p>Audra Simpson is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University.

They will look at me with their big, innocent eyes and try to make sense of what they&#x2019;re hearing. It isn&#x2019;t always easy explaining what happened even to adults, so how am I going to explain it to my kids?<br> <br>There is so much I want to share with them, so much I want them to know. You see, my story is one of hope and forgiveness and salvation, and of the glorious healing power of God&#x2019;s presence. It&#x2019;s the story of what I saw and what I learned when, during a hospital stay, I left my body for nine minutes and went to heaven and stood before God. And it&#x2019;s the story of how, when I came back to Earth, my life was profoundly and permanently changed&#x2014;changed down to the very core of my being.<br> <br>But it is also a story that, for the longest time, I didn&#x2019;t want to tell.<br> <br>I live in a wonderful town in southern Oklahoma, in a community of friendly and God-fearing people, a place where passion for Jesus runs deep. Still, I know how much damage a juicy piece of gossip can cause. I was a teacher&#x2014;someone parents trust to teach and care for their children&#x2014;and I was afraid that if people heard my story, I&#x2019;d be shunned and ridiculed and maybe even fired.<br> <br>I was afraid people would think I was flat-out crazy.<br> <br>And even though God&#x2019;s instructions to me could not have been any clearer&#x2014;&#x201c;Tell them what you can remember&#x201d;&#x2014;I struggled to understand why I had been chosen and what exactly He wanted me to do.<br> <br>I struggled, because I&#x2019;m the least likely person to be telling anyone about God.<br> <br>Put simply, I&#x2019;m not ever going to be on any short list for sainthood. Early in my life I was a sinner, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure I broke every one of the Ten Commandments. That&#x2019;s right, not just some&#x2014;all ten.<br> <br>Even the big one&#x2014;Thou shalt not kill. When I was younger, I committed a sin I believed to be so grievous and so unforgivable, I was sure God could never love me, if He even existed at all.<br> <br>And that was the other thing about me&#x2014;when it came to God&#x2019;s existence, I was a skeptic. I had grown up in the heart of the Bible Belt, been baptized not once but four times, gone to church regularly, and heard a million sermons about God. And yet, deep in my heart, I wasn&#x2019;t convinced. Over and over I challenged God to prove He existed, and every time He did. I&#x2019;d set up a new roadblock, a new challenge for Him to overcome.<br> <br>I saw the hardships in my life as evidence that God had no interest in protecting me from harm. I questioned Him, and I cursed Him. And at times I vowed to cut Him out my life.<br> <br>And still&#x2014;and still!&#x2014;God chased me and wooed me and loved me and chose me, and then He sent me back to this world to share a message.<br> <br>And so, eventually, I began to tell my story. I told strangers in restaurants, customers at Walmart, and patrons eating ice cream at Braum&#x2019;s&#x2014;anywhere and everywhere I felt God&#x2019;s familiar nudge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;My name is Crystal McVea, and in 2009 I died and went to heaven.&#x201d;<br> <br>How&#x2019;s that for an icebreaker?<br> <br>And what happened after I started telling the full story of my journey to heaven is a remarkable, miraculous tale all its own.<br> <br>Now I am sharing that story with you, in this book. Believe me, writing a book is not anything I ever thought I&#x2019;d do. It&#x2019;s not like it was on my bucket list (like taking my kids to see a Broadway show and going to the Grand Canyon), and every single day I worked on this book was a day I had to pinch myself to make sure it was really happening.<br> <br>But as soon as I got over my fears and started testifying, I knew that God&#x2019;s plan for me was to share what happened with as many people as I could. And frankly I can only spend so many hours a day at Walmart accosting strangers in the checkout line. Writing a book will leave me lots more time to get dinner ready for the kids.<br> <br>Now, are there people out there who will think I&#x2019;m a fraud, or a religious nut, or crazy? I&#x2019;m sure there are. Maybe some people who pick up this book will toss it across the room midway through and write it off as fiction. Who is this mom from Oklahoma who says she stood with God? Why should we believe anything she says? One response I sometimes get is, &#x201c;Oh, Crystal, I believe that you believe you saw God. I just don&#x2019;t know if I believe it.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s just a polite way of saying I&#x2019;m either lying or crazy without actually having to say it.<br> <br>The truth is, I know my story is hard for some people to believe. I know what I went through is beyond the realm of what we can experience on Earth. Listen, if someone had come up to me before this happened and told me they had died and stood with God, I&#x2019;m pretty sure I would have been skeptical, too.<br> <br>But I also know this book deals with the biggest and most important questions of them all: Does God exist? Is there a heaven? What is God&#x2019;s plan for us? Why are we even here?<br> <br>I certainly don&#x2019;t pretend to have all the answers. In fact, I still have plenty of questions. Nor am I claiming to be anyone special. I&#x2019;m a run-of-the-mill American mom living in the heartland. I spend my days begging my twins to take their naps, driving my older kids around to practices, and trying hard to eat better and lose a little weight (and not always succeeding). Before this happened I loved my life as a mother and a wife and a teacher, and that life fulfilled me deeply.<br> <br>But what happened to me did happen, and now I know&#x2014;after a lifetime of not knowing&#x2014;that God does exist. He gloriously, beautifully, wonderfully exists.<br> <br>And since God told me to share my whole story, that is what I&#x2019;m doing&#x2014;even though much of my story is painful and not always pretty. You will learn as you get deeper into this book that for most of my life I lived with terrible shame and horrible secrets. For the longest time I hated myself and believed I was worthless, and as a result I made so many bad choices.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s important to realize who I was in order to understand who I have become.<br> <br>Some of what I describe about my time in heaven may be familiar to you from other accounts of people dying and coming back&#x2014;the quality of the light, the shimmering entranceway, the presence of angels&#x2014;but some of it probably isn&#x2019;t. Everything I describe is absolutely, 100 percent how I remember it&#x2014;that has always been my one and only rule for sharing my testimony. Nothing is embellished or exaggerated even the tiniest bit. I always tell people, &#x201c;If I was going to make this up, I&#x2019;d have made it a lot more dramatic.&#x201d; What I describe is what I experienced, nothing more or less.<br> <br>What I can say is that the things God showed me were simply astonishing in their power and impact, and now the reality of God&#x2019;s presence bursts forth from my heart every day. The truth is, I was more alive in those nine minutes than I have ever been in all my years on this Earth.<br> <br>And now I can only hope that through my descriptions, however inadequate they may be, you will feel even a fraction of the power and the impact and the absolute glory of what I experienced.<br> <br><br> <br>NOT LONG AGO I read about a national Pew survey that showed the number of young Americans who have doubts about the existence of God is growing. In 2007, only 17 percent of people aged thirty or younger said they had some doubt that God was real. In 2012, that number went up to 32 percent. That&#x2019;s roughly a third of young Americans surveyed who aren&#x2019;t sure if they believe God is real.<br> <br>Then there is a recent comment from Professor Stephen Hawking, the famous Cambridge scientist. &#x201c;There is no heaven or afterlife,&#x201d; he said in a 2012 interview. &#x201c;That is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maybe the Pew poll and Hawking&#x2019;s comment should upset me, but they don&#x2019;t. And the reason they don&#x2019;t is because I used to be one of those doubters. I understand the skepticism, because a skeptical streak still runs through me. As a kid I questioned everything, and as an adult I&#x2019;m still nosing around, searching for answers.<br> <br>And while I no longer have any doubts about God and His power, I also realize that I am lucky, because I got to stand with Him. For many others, faith is about believing in a God they can&#x2019;t see. And for some, faith means believing in a God they have questions about. Just because you have questions doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t have faith.<br> <br>My point is, I can&#x2019;t prove that what happened to me actually happened. Reading this book requires some measure of faith. Ultimately, what you take from my story depends on what you believe.<br> <br>In the hallway of our home, just outside the bedroom where my youngest daughter plays with her purple stuffed donkey and my youngest son cooks up adventures for his little wooden robot, not far from where my oldest boy lifts weights and my teenage daughter texts her friends nonstop, a verse from the Bible is stenciled across the wall in black script. It reads<br> <br>&#x201c;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,<br> <br>And the evidence of things unseen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hebrews 11:1&#x2013;3<br> <br>Because of what happened to me, I know that God is real. But you don&#x2019;t have to die and stand with God to know what I know.<br> <br>What makes God real for anyone is faith.<br> <br>And so, when my twins come up to me and ask me about my story, what will I tell them? I guess I will sit them down and start by saying, &#x201c;Children, there is a heaven, and heaven is beautiful.&#x201d;</p><h2>J.r.r. Tolkien: Author of the Century</h2><p>Recent polls have consistently declared that J.R.R. Tolkien is "the most influential author of the century," and The Lord of the Rings is "the book of the century." In support of these claims, the prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy Professor Tom Shippey now presents us with a fascinating companion to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, focusing in particular on The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion.<br> The core of the book examines The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic and cultural map and as a response to the meaning of myth. It presents a unique argument to explain the nature of evil and also gives the reader a compelling insight into the unparalleled level of skill necessary to construct such a rich and complex story. Shippey also examines The Hobbit, explaining the hobbits' anachronistic relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth, and shows the fundamental importance of The Silmarillion to the canon of Tolkien's work. He offers as well an illuminating look at other, lesser-known works in their connection to Tolkien's life.</p><p>The Definitive Critical Study of J.R.R. Tolkien's Greatest Works -- An Indispensable Companion to the World of Middle-Earth <p>"Shippey succeeds brilliantly...[His] exploration of Tolkien's themes, especially the nature of evil, power, and what one character calls 'the long defeat,' is superb...Taking on the critics on their own ground, Shippey reveals Tolkien's use of a complex narrative structure and the flexibility with which he moved between different literary modes." --<i>Independent</i> </p><p>"Shippey's witty, combative book is illuminating...the central chapters demonstrate the ingenious articulation of the trilogy, the profundity of its thought about suffering, and evil, both personal and institutional, cosmic and frankly devilish." &#x2013;<i>Observer</i></p><p>Tom Shippey taught at Oxford University at the same time as J.R.R. Tolkien and with the same syllabus, which gives him an intimate familiarity with the works that fueled Tolkien's imagination. He subsequently held the chair of English language and medieval literature at Leeds University that Tolkien had previously held.</p></p><h2>Vindicating the Vixens: Revisiting Sexualized, Vilified, and Marginalized Women of the Bible</h2><p>Gain a greater understanding of gender in the Bible through the eyes of a diverse group of evangelical scholars who assert that Christians have missed the point of some scriptural stories by assuming the women in them were "bad girls."<br><br>Did the Samaritan woman really divorce five husbands in a world where women rarely divorced even one? Did Bathsheba seduce King David by bathing in the nude? Was Mary Magdalene really a reformed prostitute?<br><br>While many have written studies of the women in the Bible, this is a new kind of book--one in which an international team of male and female scholars look afresh at vilified and neglected women in the Bible.

What a joy to know teachers have a resource to exhort their congregations to be like Peter and Paul, and also like Tamar and Rahab. As each chapter vindicates another woman, God&#x2019;s love for the marginalized and oppressed jumps off the pages reminding us that he welcomes men and women to pick up the hammer and get to work in the <i>Missio Dei</i>. (Nika Spaulding, Resident Theologian at St Jude Oak Cliff 2017-08-01)<br><br><i>Vindicating the Vixens</i> is a monumentally important work in that it confronts the prevalent misinterpretations of some of the most critical women in Scripture. The faithful and meticulous research of Dr. Glahn and the contributing authors advances the powerful message of the book&#x2015;of God&#x2019;s passion for the marginalized, the misunderstood, and the outsider. This book will challenge the way you look at women, both those in the Bible and those you meet every day. (Paul Lanum, Vice President of Publishing <i>RightNow Media</i> 2017-08-01)<br><br>One of the most important tasks of the believer is to practice faithful exegesis of Scripture, to allow the text to speak for itself without inserting personal or cultural bias. Through the centuries, many women of the Bible have unfairly labeled, and thus, inaccurately taught. Drawing from faithful study, insight, and experience, the authors expose the errors passed down through the generations and bring to light this beautiful truth: The God of the Bible highly esteems and works through women. Let the Vixens be vindicated and the Word of God celebrated! I am so grateful for this book. (Rebecca Carrell, Conference Speaker, Bible Teacher, and KCBI Morning Show Co-Host 2017-08-01)<br><br>The biblical narrative provides an accurate description of gender. All human beings bear the imago Dei and enjoy the same God-given value and dignity. The fall distorted the relationship of humanity with God and among all people regardless of their gender. The salvation and restoration that Christ brings to humanity makes no distinction between male or female and, in fact, destroys all human-made gender marginalization. For this reason, it becomes imperative to handle faithfully the biblical text in order to have an appropriate understanding of gender, sexuality, and marginalization. Sandra Glahn selected an important group of contributors who together portray a faithful description of key women in the Bible. This exceptional and relevant text fills and unfortunate gap created by distorted perspectives created by tradition and not from the Scriptures. (Octavio Javier Esqueda, Professor of Christian Higher Education <i>Talbot School of Theology at Biola University</i> 2017-08-01)<br><br>I always love the stories of God's daughters in His storybook of His relentless love and pursuit of us. I especially love when the fuller stories open our eyes to surprising realities. In <i>Vindicating the Vixens</i>, Sandra Glahn has pulled together a treasure trove of those stories, written with careful theology, cultural comprehension and captivating narrative. I can name a few of my favorites&#x2015;Eve, Ruth, Deborah, Mary Magdalene&#x2015;but truly, I loved getting to know every one of these too-often maligned sisters better. And so will you, I'm sure. (Judy Douglass, Director, Women&#x2019;s Resources <i>Cru</i> 2017-08-01)<br><br><i>Vindicating the Vixens</i> is a course correction for the Church&#x2015;and an invaluable one at that. Chapter after chapter it redeems the reputation of many of the biblical women we&#x2019;ve often misunderstood. In the process, it removes misunderstandings, misplaced convictions, and unintentional bias and in their place leaves a better sense of God's love and justice. Reassessing my forgone conclusions has never felt so valuable.

Is natural selection an unsupported hypothesis or a confirmed mechanism of evolutionary change? These were the courageous questions that professor of law Phillip Johnson originally took up in 1991. His relentless pursuit to follow the evidence wherever it leads remains as relevant today as then. The facts and the logic of the arguments that purport to establish a theory of evolution based on Darwinian principles, says Johnson, continue to draw their strength from faith--faith in philosophical naturalism. In this edition Johnson responds to critics of the first edition and maintains that scientists have put the cart before the horse, regarding as scientific fact what really should be regarded as a yet unproved hypothesis. Also included is a new, extended introduction by noted biologist Michael Behe, who chronicles the ongoing relevance of Johnson&#39;s cogent analysis.</p><p><strong>Phillip E. Johnson</strong> is a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Chicago Law School. He taught law for more than thirty years at the University of California at Berkeley where he is professor emeritus. For the last decade Johnson has also been at the forefront of the public debate over evolution and creation. He has taken his message to such places as the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em> His InterVarsity Press titles include <em>Reason in the Balance, The Wedge of Truth, The Right Questions</em> and <em>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds.</em>In his own era, Darwin's most formidable opponents were fossil experts, not clergymen. Even today, according to the author, the fossil record, far from conclusive, does not support the presumed existence of intermediate links between species. A law teacher at UC-Berkeley, Johnson deems unpersuasive the alleged proofs for Darwin's assertion that natural selection can produce new species. He also argues that recent molecular studies of DNA fail to confirm the existence of common ancestors for different species. Doubting the smooth line of transitional steps between apes and humans sketched by neo-Darwinists, he cites evidence for "rapid branching," i.e., mysterious leaps which presumably produced the human mind and spirit from animal materials. This evidence, to Johnson, suggests that "the putative hominid species" may not have contained our ancestors after all. This cogent, succinct inquiry cuts like a knife through neo-Darwinist assumptions. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Was Logging</h2><p>&#34;Someday&#34; Big Fred Hewett used to say in his Humboldt Saloon in Aberdeen, Washington, &#34;these pictures will show how the boys used to do it.&#34; He knew the day would come when the Pacific Northwest&#39;s &#34;Big Woods&#34; would be only a fog-blurred memory and the cry &#34;Logs! More Logs!&#34; would no longer be heard ringing up and down the skidroads. With the superb views of timber photographer Darius Kinsey, comprising more than 200 pictures made from wet plate celluloid negatives, 11&#34; x 14&#34;, and processed by his pioneer wife, Tabitha, author Andrews dramatically presents a panorama of lumbering&#39;s great days in these woods from 1890 to 1925. Shown in sharp detail are the first axes, 12-foot crosscut saws, the first oxen and horses, the first donkey engines and &#34;lokeys&#34;. Then the story continues into the &#34;highball&#34; days, the high production period with the steel tower skidders and miles of steel rigging.</p><p>From his home in Seattle, Ralph Andrews has written many books to document American Northwest logging and its people.</p><h2>Miami Blues</h2><p>After a brutal day investigating a quadruple homicide, Detective Hoke Moseley settles into his room at the un-illustrious El Dorado Hotel and nurses a glass of brandy. With his guard down, he doesn&#x2019;t think twice when he hears a knock on the door. The next day, he finds himself in the hospital, badly bruised and with his jaw wired shut. He thinks back over ten years of cases wondering who would want to beat him into unconsciousness, steal his gun and badge, and most importantly, make off with his prized dentures. But the pieces never quite add up to revenge, and the few clues he has keep connecting to a dimwitted hooker, and her ex-con boyfriend and the bizarre murder of a Hare Krishna pimp.<br><br>Chronically depressed, constantly strapped for money, always willing to bend the rules a bit, Hoke Moseley is hardly what you think of as the perfect cop, but he is one of the the greatest detective creations of all time.</p><p>"If you are looking for a master's insight into the humid decandence of South Florida and its polyglot tribes, nobody does that as well as Mr. Willeford."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Harrowing and surprising."<br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"The best book on the mystery racks these days [is] Charles Willeford's <i>Miami Blues.</i>"<br><i>--The Village Voice</i></p><p></p>Beware of the cop.&nbsp;&nbsp;He bites.<br><br>Hoke Moseley never saw him coming: the person who crashed into his squalid little hidey-hole in the Eldorado Hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;When his assailant was was done, Hoke's pride and joy, his dentures, were gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;So were his gun and his badge.<br><br>Recovering from the brutal beating, Hoke tried to figure out who had administered it.

By the end of the fifth century, Roman rule had vanished in western Europe and much of northern Africa, and only a shrunken Eastern Empire remained. In his account of the fall of the Roman Empire, prizewinning author Adrian Goldsworthy examines the painful centuries of the superpower&#x2019;s decline. Bringing history to life through the stories of the men, women, heroes, and villains involved, the author uncovers surprising lessons about the rise and fall of great nations.</p><p>This was a period of remarkable personalities, from the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius to emperors like Diocletian, who portrayed themselves as tough, even brutal, soldiers. It was a time of revolutionary ideas, especially in religion, as Christianity went from persecuted sect to the religion of state and emperors. Goldsworthy pays particular attention to the willingness of Roman soldiers to fight and kill each other. Ultimately, this is the story of how an empire without a serious rival rotted from within, its rulers and institutions putting short-term ambition and personal survival over the wider good of the state.</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, May 2009: </b>Adrian Goldsworthy's <i>Caesar: Life of a Colossus</i> was a masterly fusion of vivid historical biography and scholarly detail, an impeccably researched work that also succeeded as a compelling read. With <i>How Rome Fell</i>, Goldsworthy's eye turns to the forces that ultimately destroyed the Roman Empire, challenging the traditional assumption that Rome was sacked by ultimately irrepressible foreign armies. Goldsworthy asserts that Rome's foes in the death throes of empire weren't any more formidable than those at its peak, but that the cutthroat nature of its political system fractured and diverted forces better spent maintaining the integrity of provincial borders--it was civil war and paranoia that destroyed the empire from within. Drawing parallels to modern societies might be tempting, but Goldsworthy is interested in Rome and resists foreboding or moralistic tones--even making a point of acknowledging the different dynamics that drive the rise and fall current powers. In just over 400 pages, <i>How Rome Fell</i> speeds the both the casual and Rome-savvy reader through 400 years of tumultuous and world-changing history--it's a worthy successor to the triumph of <i>Caesar</i>.--<i>Jon Foro</i><p>A conversation with Adrian Goldsworthy . . .</p><p>Q: &nbsp;&nbsp;How does focusing on an individual life, as in your highly acclaimed <i>Caesar,</i> compare with the sweeping history of empire that you have created in <i>How Rome Fell</i>?</p><p>A:&nbsp; It is very different. In a biography the framework of the book naturally follows that of an individual&#x2019;s life from birth to death fifty-six years in Caesar&#x2019;s case.&nbsp;Looking at the decline and fall of the Roman Empire is a much bigger question. The time span I chose covers some four centuries. This makes it a much more complex story to tell, yet this complexity makes it all the more fascinating. &nbsp;</p><p>Q:&nbsp; Did you have Gibbon in mind as you wrote?&nbsp;</p><p>A:&nbsp; The scale and perception of Gibbon&#x2019;s work remains awe inspiring. However,&nbsp;<i>Decline and Fall </i>was very much a product of its author and his age the volumes were released in the shadow of the American Revolution and reflected an eighteenth-century Englishman&#x2019;s view of society and religion.</p><p>Q:&nbsp; How did you determine your starting and ending points?</p><p>A: &nbsp;Like Gibbon, I begin with the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180, as he is the last emperor for a long period whose character we can know not least through his famous <i>Meditations</i>. It is also a good point to look at the Empire at this period, when it was clearly at its height. Gibbon, however, continued his narrative into the fifteenth century, ending with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. That marked the end of a state directly descended from the empire of the Caesars. However, the Eastern Roman Empire was already a pale shadow of its united predecessor by the end of the sixth century, even before much of its territory was overrun by the initial conquests of the Muslim Arabs in the seventh century. The theme of <i>How Rome Fell</i> is the process that led to this.</p><p>Q:&nbsp; Your subtitle is <i>Death of a Superpower.</i> Are you suggesting a direct correlation between events of Ancient Rome and&nbsp;America in the twenty-first century?</p><p>A:&nbsp; No, the situations are, of course, very different. Besides, we need to understand the past on its own terms before drawing lessons from the present and future.</p></p><h2>Challenging Behavior in Young Children: Understanding, Preventing and Responding Effectively</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p> <p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

Using the dialogue form, a genre common in classical philosophical works, Galileo masterfully demonstrates the truth of the Copernican system over the Ptolemaic one, proving, for the first time, that the earth revolves around the sun. Its influence is incalculable. The Dialogue is not only one of the most important scientific treatises ever written, but a work of supreme clarity and accessibility, remaining as readable now as when it was first published.

Yesterday we resolved to meet today and discuss as clearly and in as much detail as possible the character and the efficacy of those laws of nature which up to the present have been put forth by the partisans of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic position on the one hand, and by the followers of the Copernican system on the other. Since Copernicus places the earth among the movable heavenly bodies, making it a globe like a planet, we may well begin our discussion by examining the Peripatetic steps in arguing the impossibility of that hypothesis; what they are, and how great is their force and effect. For this it is necessary to introduce into nature two substances which differ essentially. These are the celestial and the elemental, the former being invariant and eternal; the latter, temporary and destructible. This argument Aristotle treats in his book De Caelo, introducing it with some discourses dependent upon certain general assumptions, and afterwards confirming it by experiments and specific demonstrations. Following the same method, I shall first propound, and then freely speak my opinion, submitting myself to your criticisms-particularly those of Simplicio, that stout champion and defender of Aristotelian doctrines.<br><br>The first step in the Peripatetic arguments is Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world. For, he tells us, it is not a mere line, nor a bare surface, but a body having length, breadth, and depth. Since there are only these three dimensions, the world, having these, has them all, and, having the Whole, is perfect. To be sure, I much wish that Aristotle had proved to me by rigorous deductions that simple length constitutes the dimension which we call a line, which by the addition of breadth becomes a surface; that by further adding altitude or depth to this there results a body, and that after these three dimensions there is no passing farther-so that by these three alone, completeness, or, so to speak, wholeness is concluded. Especially since he might have done so very plainly and speedily.<br><br>Simp. What about the elegant demonstrations in the second, third, and fourth texts, after the definition of "continuous"? Is it not there first proved that there are no more than three dimensions, since Three is everything, and everywhere? And is this not confirmed by the doctrine and authority of the Pythagoreans, who say that all things are determined by three-beginning, middle, and end-which is the number of the Whole? Also, why leave out another of his reasons; namely, that this number is used, as if by a law of nature, in sacrifices to the gods? Furthermore, is it not dictated by nature that we attribute the title of "all" to those things that are three, and not less? For two are called "both," and one does not say "all" unless there are three.</p><h2>The Question That Never Goes Away: Why?</h2><p><p><strong>Finding Meaning in the Midst of Suffering</strong></p><p>In his classic book <em>Where Is God When It Hurts, </em>Philip Yancey gave us permission to doubt, reasons not to abandon faith, and practical ways to reach out to hurting people.</p><p>And now, thirty years after writing his first book, Yancey revisits our cry of &#x201c;Why, God&#x201d; in three places stunned into silence by the calamities that have devastated them.&nbsp; At some point all of us will face the challenges to faith Yancey writes about and look for the comfort and hope he describes.</p><p>There are reasons to ask, once again, the question that never goes away: Where is God when we suffer?

Revisiting historical icons so familiar that schoolchildren learn to take them for granted, he makes surprising connections that enable readers to see old stories in a new light.<br><br>Among the historical moments revisited here, a revolutionary nation arises from its environment and struggles to reconcile the diversity of its people with the claim that nature is the source of liberty. Abraham Lincoln, an unlettered citizen from the countryside, steers the Union through a moment of extreme peril, guided by his clear-eyed vision of nature's capacity for improvement. In Topeka, Kansas, transformations of land and life prompt a lawsuit that culminates in the momentous civil rights case of <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.<br><br>By focusing on materials and processes intrinsic to all things and by highlighting the nature of the United States, Fiege recovers the forgotten and overlooked ground on which so much history has unfolded.

More and more people are interested in the American system of justice and the individuals who experience it firsthand.<br><br><em>Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology</em> gives you an inside view of 20 of the highest profile legal cases of the last 50 years. Drs. Ewing and McCann take you "behind the scenes" of each of these cases, some involving celebrities like Woody Allen, Mike Tyson, and Patty Hearst, and explain the impact they had on the fields of psychology and the law. Many of the cases in this book, whether involving a celebrity client or an ordinary person in an extraordinary circumstance, were determined in part by the expert testimony of a psychologist or other mental health professional. Psychology has always played a vital role in so many aspects of the American legal system, and these fascinating trials offer insight into many intriguing psychological issues. In addition to expert testimony, some of the issues discussed in this entertaining and educational book include the insanity defense, brainwashing, criminal profiling, capital punishment, child custody, juvenile delinquency, and false confessions.<br><br>In <em>Minds on Trial</em>, the authors skillfully convey the psychological and legal drama of each case, while providing important and fresh professional insights.<br><br>Mental health and legal professionals, as well as others with an interest in psychology and the law will have a hard time putting this scholarly, yet readable book down.<br></p><p>Charles Patrick Ewing is at SUNY Buffalo.

The authors, well-respected forensic mental health professionals, make expert testimony come alive in a series of well known and not so well known cases, providing examples of expert testimony at its best and worst. Their analysis of the testimony proffered in these cases should serve to remind all experts of their accountability and the effects their opinions have on the lives of others."-- Alan M. Goldstein, Ph.D., ABPP, Board Certified Forensic Psychologist, John Jay College of Criminal Justice - CUNY<p></p><br>"<em>Minds on Trial</em> accomplishes a rare feat: it is both solidly academic and utterly fascinating. Ewing and McCann present vivid accounts of the twenty most memorable moments that psychologists have had in the courtroom. The reader will learn a great deal about psychology and about law from this book, not least because he or she will not be able to put it down."-- John Monahan, Doherty Professor of Law and Psychology, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Ewing and McCann have achieved the remarkable objective of a readable and scholarly reexamination of twenty of the most important criminal &amp; forensic cases. In a style as engrossing as a good novel, they delve into defendants like Andrea Yates and Jeffrey Dahmer and experts like Park Dietz, Elizabeth Loftus, and Gisli Gudjonsson, and what their lives and work teach us about law, justice, and the nature of psychiatric disorders. This terrific combination of psychological substance and engaging writing style illuminates personal and the professional aspects of the famous crimes of our time.

The process seems fairly straightforward, but at the last minute, the newlyweds discover that Parnell Vaughn, Catherine's legal father,&nbsp;has a claim on the child, and his grasping fianc�e is demanding&nbsp;a financial settlement to relinquish parental rights. Even though exchanging money for a child is illegal, Frank and Sarah's love for Catherine drives them to comply. <br><br>When Frank returns with the money and finds Vaughn beaten to death, all evidence points to Frank as the culprit. A not-quite-famous actor with modest means, Vaughn seems an unlikely candidate for murder, particularly such a violent crime of passion. But Frank soon uncovers real-life&nbsp;intrigue as dramatic as any that appears on stage. <br><br>Sarah and Frank enlist those closest to them to help hunt for Vaughn's killer as Frank's own life--and the future of their family--hang in the balance.</p><p><b>Victoria Thompson</b> is the Edgar� and Agatha award-nominated author of the Gaslight mysteries--including <i>Murder in the Bowery, Murder in Morningside Heights, Murder on St. Nicholas Avenue</i>, and <i>Murder on Amsterdam Avenue</i>--as well as numerous historical novels. She lives in the Chicago area with her family.1<br><br> What do you mean, we can't adopt Catherine?" Sarah asked the attorney.<br><br> "Michael Hicks gave her a look that told her he shared her frustration. "I'm sorry-"<br><br> "I thought Mr. Wilbanks settled all of this in his will," Sarah's husband said. Frank Malloy reached over and took her hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. They'd come to Michael's office today expecting good news. Plainly, they were going to be disappointed.<br><br> "I thought David had settled everything, too," Michael said. "And I know he certainly intended to as well. My father-in-law was a very careful man, but you see, I didn't draw up his final will. Estates are not my area of expertise, and it would be unethical for me to prepare a will for a family member in any case, so I referred him to a colleague of mine, Bill Jonson."<br><br> "Are you saying this colleague made a mistake?" Malloy was angry now but trying not to take it out on poor Michael. Sarah understood completely.<br><br> "Not a mistake." Michael was being very diplomatic. "My father-in-law was careful but also very private. He didn't believe he needed to tell Mr. Jonson all the sordid details about Catherine's birth."<br><br> "Which ones did he leave out?" Malloy asked.<br><br> Michael winced. "I, uh, I've asked Mr. Jonson to join us, if you don't mind, so he can explain it all to you." He got up and went to his office door to admit a man who had obviously been waiting for this summons.<br><br> Michael introduced Mr. Jonson, who was a distinguished-looking man of middle age wearing a conservatively cut, tailor-made suit and immaculate shirtfront. When they were all seated again, Michael said, "Bill, I have informed Mr. and Mrs. Malloy that they cannot adopt Catherine, but I haven't explained exactly why yet. I thought you could do that better than I."<br><br> "Of course." Mr. Jonson gave them his best reassuring smile. "You see, Mr. Wilbanks told me that Catherine was the illegitimate child he had with his mistress, an actress named Emma Hardy. However, he didn't think it necessary to explain that Emma Hardy also happened to be married to a Mr. Parnell Vaughn at the time of their affair. He probably thought it was none of my business."<br><br> "But what difference does that make?" Sarah asked. "Even Mr. Vaughn admitted he couldn't possibly be Catherine's father because he and Emma were separated when she met Mr. Wilbanks."<br><br> "Which is why Mr. Wilbanks didn't think it necessary to mention Mr. Vaughn at all," Jonson said. "Unfortunately, the law is rather unforgiving when it comes to matters of paternity."<br><br> "What does that mean?" Malloy asked.<br><br> "It means that the law considers a woman's husband to be the father of her children, regardless of any evidence to the contrary."<br><br> "But that's ridiculous," Sarah tried.<br><br> "In some cases, yes, but it is nevertheless the law."<br><br> "So you're telling us that the law considers Parnell Vaughn to be Catherine's father?" Malloy asked, no longer bothering to hide his anger.<br><br> "Yes," Michael said, "and that's one reason why David decided to leave part of his estate to Frank rather than directly to Catherine."<br><br> "You mean he knew about this paternity law?" Sarah asked.<br><br> "No, I'm sure he didn't," Mr. Jonson said. "And I certainly didn't explain it to him because I had no idea Miss Hardy was ever married to Mr. Vaughn. Rest assured, I would have made sure to settle the matter prior to Mr. Wilbanks's death. Even without knowing about Mr. Vaughn, I was already very concerned that if he left Catherine a great deal of money in her own right, she'd be a tempting target for any greedy family members Emma Hardy may have had or anyone willing to pretend to be her family member. A large inheritance would also make her a target for fortune hunters later in life."<br><br> "But after seeing how much you loved Catherine, Frank," Michael said, "David decided you were the man who could and would protect her from both of those dangers."<br><br> Malloy winced and glanced at his wife. "He should have left the money to Sarah."<br><br> "I'm afraid David was also old-fashioned. He would never trust a female with so much money, and besides, Sarah had already told him she wouldn't accept it." Michael smiled slightly. "I must also tell you that Mr. Jonson did not approve of David making you one of his heirs, Frank."<br><br> "I certainly did not," Jonson said. "Even though Mr. Wilbanks's will instructed you to become Catherine's legal guardian, there was no way to compel you to do so. Such a provision causes an attorney great concern."<br><br> "Yes, it does," Michael said. "Bill was almost apoplectic about it."<br><br> "So was I," Malloy said. "I wish I'd suspected he was going to do it so I could have threatened to refuse it like Sarah did."<br><br> "Which is why he never informed you, I'm sure," Michael said.<br><br> Mr. Jonson still looked distressed. "You see, after you received your inheritance, you could have abandoned Catherine completely, and even now you have no obligation to share any of the money with her."<br><br> "But we would never abandon Catherine," Sarah said.<br><br> "David believed that, I know," Michael said, "which is why he did what he did, but the fact remains that he has put you in a difficult position. You can't adopt Catherine as long as Vaughn is legally her father."<br><br> "You might get a judge to name you as her official guardian," Jonson said, "but it would mean a court case and publicity you'd find distasteful and a scandal that could follow her all of her life. You'd probably win in the end, although there's no guarantee of that, but even if you did, you still wouldn't be able to adopt Catherine, and Vaughn would always be there."<br><br> "You might never hear from him again, of course," Michael said, "but whenever there's money involved, people do tend to make nuisances of themselves. There's no telling what he might do, and after what happened before . . ."<br><br> "You don't think he'd try to kidnap her?" Sarah asked in alarm, remembering the horror of her first encounter with Catherine's blood relatives.<br><br> "It wouldn't legally be kidnapping," Michael said. "In the eyes of the law, he's her father, so he could be entitled to custody."<br><br> Sarah couldn't help groaning.<br><br> "So what can we do about this?" Malloy asked impatiently. "I know you lawyers always have an answer for everything."<br><br> Michael glanced at Jonson, who said, "We do try, but there isn't always an easy answer for everything. In this case, you would need for Vaughn to relinquish his parental rights. I could have the documents drawn up and when he has signed them, you could then proceed with the adoption."<br><br> "And Vaughn couldn't come back later to reclaim Catherine?" Sarah asked.<br><br> "No, he couldn't."<br><br> "I wonder how much he'll want in exchange for his signature," Malloy said.<br><br> "Uh, that's another thing we need to discuss," Michael said uneasily. "It's illegal for you to pay him to give up custody."<br><br> "What?" Malloy nearly shouted. "Why would that be illegal?"<br><br> "Because it's considered selling a child, and selling human beings is illegal in the United States, I'm happy to say."<br><br> Sarah wanted to weep. "So we're supposed to convince Mr. Vaughn to sign Catherine over to us out of the goodness of his heart?"<br><br> "I'm afraid so."<br><br> "And if he doesn't have any goodness in his heart?" Malloy asked.<br><br> Michael and Mr. Jonson exchanged looks again. "Let's just hope he does."<br><br> What are we going to do?� Sarah asked Malloy the moment Michael�s office door closed behind them.<br><br> "<br><br> "We're going to find Parnell Vaughn and convince him to sign Catherine over to us."<br><br> "What are the chances he'll do it?"<br><br> Sarah didn't like Malloy's expression one little bit. "Very small, I'd guess."<br><br> Sarah wanted to weep again. "He'd do it if we paid him, I'm sure."<br><br> "I know, which is why I think we'll have to pay him."<br><br> "But Michael said that's illegal!"<br><br> "Which means we're stuck either way."<br><br> "What do you mean?"<br><br> "I mean, when Vaughn finds out he's legally Catherine's father, he'll probably decide he'd be a fool to sign her over. He'll know that as long as he has the right to claim her, we'll be willing to keep paying him off to keep him from doing so."<br><br> "But if he signs the papers . . ." Sarah said.<br><br> "Which he won't do unless we pay him, and if he knows that's illegal, he'll always have that over us, too. If we don't keep paying him, he'll accuse us of 'buying' Catherine and try to get her back again."<br><br> "So, we're back to my original question: What are we going to do?"<br><br> "I'm going to find Vaughn. We can't decide anything until we've talked to him."<br><br> He was right, of course. "He's probably touring in some theater company, though." Vaughn was an actor, too, which was how he'd met Emma Hardy. "How will we track him down?"<br><br> "Same way we did before, and with any luck, we'll find out he drank himself to death since we last saw him."<br><br> "Oh, Malloy, we don't really wish him dead," Sarah said, although she couldn't help thinking how Vaughn's death would make everything so much simpler.<br><br> Mr. Malloy is right,� Maeve said. �If Vaughn was dead, that would make everything so much easier.�<br><br> "<br><br> Sarah gave her nanny a look meant to chasten her, although she was sure such efforts were wasted on the girl. "We do not wish Mr. Vaughn ill, Maeve. We simply want him to sign some papers." Sarah had gone straight home after their meeting with Michael Hicks, while Malloy had gone to find out what he could about Parnell Vaughn. Maeve had just returned from the Lower East Side, where she was supervising the workmen who were turning the old house Sarah had purchased into a maternity clinic that would provide services free of charge to women in need. She'd wanted to tell Sarah how she'd outsmarted the workmen yet again and terrorized them into doing exactly what she demanded, but she'd forgotten all that when Sarah told her about their meeting with the attorney.<br><br> "Oh no, I don't wish Mr. Vaughn any misfortune," Maeve assured her with just the right amount of sincerity. "But I'm afraid your lawyer is right. People act strange when money is involved."<br><br> "Then we'll deal with that when we must. In the meantime, tell me how the clinic is coming along."<br><br> "Women are still coming to the door every day wanting to know when we're going to open," Maeve said.<br><br> "I know. You've told me that before. I'm sure everyone knows the midwives have moved in, too, so that probably doesn't help."<br><br> "Those two women you hired are going to be perfect, and having them move in to make sure the place is occupied at night was a very good idea. They're already making home visits, and Miss Hanson delivered a baby last night."<br><br> "She did?" Sarah couldn't have been more delighted. "Oh, I do miss those deliveries." Sarah had made her living as a midwife for years before her marriage.<br><br> "I already told them they'll need to let you deliver a baby every now and then."<br><br> "Thank you," Sarah said with a grin.<br><br> "Oh, and I almost forgot, you'll never guess who I saw today."<br><br> Sarah didn't particularly care, since her mind was still focused on Catherine and their situation, in spite of Maeve's best efforts to distract her. "Who?"<br><br> "That fortune-teller, Serafina Straface."<br><br> "Serafina? Really?" Sarah asked in surprise. "How long has it been since we saw her?"<br><br> "A couple years, I think."<br><br> "What did she want?"<br><br> Maeve gave her a pitying look. "The same thing all the other women want."<br><br> "Oh!" So Serafina was expecting.<br><br> "Yes. Apparently, she's still telling fortunes or whatever it was she did."<br><br> "She's a medium."<br><br> Maeve rolled her eyes at such a notion. "So she says. Then I guess she's still a medium, but I gathered she's looking for a private place to have her baby."<br><br> "I suppose she married her young man, Mr. DiLoreto."<br><br> "You can suppose that all you want, but when she told me her name, she said it was Straface."<br><br> "Oh dear." The world was not kind to unwed mothers. Then she remembered. "In Italy, women don't take their husband's name."<br><br> "Really?"<br><br> "Yes, really."<br><br> "That's interesting. But I guess in America, actresses don't either. Emma Hardy didn't."<br><br> "You're right, she didn't. So Serafina is interested in using the clinic?"<br><br> "I think she was just interested in using you as a midwife. She said she went to your old house, and they sent her to the clinic to find you."<br><br> "Our neighbors have been very good about not telling people where we live now," Sarah said.<br><br> "Yes, they have, and it sure cuts down on the number of people coming here looking for a handout," Maeve said with a smirk. "She didn't tell me when, uh, she'll need the clinic, but she seemed glad to hear it should be ready in a few days."<br><br> "Do you think so?" Sarah asked in surprise.<br><br> "If I have anything to say about it, it will. I have those workmen terrified of Mr. Malloy, especially after they tried to pretend they didn't know they were supposed to fix the wall in the back today."<br><br> "Maeve, you missed your calling."<br><br> "I know. I should've been a man. I would've been good at it, too. Better than most men, anyway."<br><br> Sarah couldn't help laughing, in spite of everything, which she guessed had been Maeve's intention. "I didn't mean that. I meant you should have been a . . ."<br><br> Maeve waited a few seconds while Sarah tried in vain to think of some profession to which a woman could aspire that would use Maeve's talents. "See? You can't think of anything. I was right. I should've been a man."<br><br> "But instead you're going to help other women."<br><br> "I suppose, and maybe someday Mr. Malloy will let me work for him."<br><br> Finding Parnell Vaughn turned out to be much easier than Frank had anticipated. As an actor, Vaughn often worked for touring companies, and he might have been anywhere in the country. The last time they�d tried to locate him, he�d just been returning to New York from a tour. Frank tried the theatrical agent who had helped him then, only to discover that agents represented shows, not actors, and Vaughn was no longer appearing in any of that agent�s shows. Frank had to visit only a couple more agents, however, before he found his quarry.<br><br> "Oh yes, Parnell Vaughn," Mr. Dinsmore said with obvious distaste. "He's having quite a successful run with Mrs. Hawkes at the Palladium Theater."<br><br> "Mrs. Hawkes?" Adelia Hawkes was one of the most famous actresses in the country. "Are you sure? It's Parnell Vaughn I'm looking for. Maybe you have him confused with someone else."</p><h2>Damage Control (Joanna Brady Mysteries, 13)</h2><p><p>At first glance, it appears to be an accident . . .</p><p>A car carrying an elderly couple goes off the side of a mountain and tumbles into oblivion on a beautiful sunny day in the Coronado National Monument.

In a time when women could not vote, hold public office, or teach outside the home, the charismatic Hutchinson wielded remarkable political power. Her unconventional ideas had attracted a following of prominent citizens eager for social reform. Hutchinson defended herself brilliantly, but the judges, faced with a perceived threat to public order, banished her for behaving in a manner "not comely for [her] sex."</p><p>Written by one of Hutchinson's direct descendants, <em>American Jezebel</em> brings both balance and perspective to Hutchinson's story. It captures this American heroine's life in all its complexity, presenting her not as a religious fanatic, a cardboard feminist, or a raging crank&#x2014;as some have portrayed her&#x2014;but as a flesh-and-blood wife, mother, theologian, and political leader. The book narrates her dramatic expulsion from Massachusetts, after which her judges, still threatened by her challenges, promptly built Harvard College to enforce religious and social orthodoxies&#x2014;making her the mid-wife to the nation's first college. In exile, she settled Rhode Island, becoming the only woman ever to co-found an American colony.</p><p>The seeds of the American struggle for women's and human rights can be found in the story of this one woman's courageous life. <em>American Jezebel</em> illuminates the origins of our modern concepts of religious freedom, equal rights, and free speech, and showcases an extraordinary woman whose achievements are astonishing by the standards of any era.</p></p><p><p>Eve LaPlante, a sixth great-granddaughter of Samuel Sewall, is the author of two previous critically acclaimed books: <em>American Jezebel</em>, a biography of her ancestor Anne Hutchinson, and <em>Seized</em>, a narrative portrait of temporal lobe epilepsy. LaPlante has degrees from Princeton and Harvard and has written for <em>The Atlantic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>, and <em>Boston</em> magazine. She lives with her family in New England on land once owned by Judge Sewall. </p><i>*Starred Review.*</i> LaPlante, an 11th-generation granddaughter of Hutchinson, provides a fast-paced and elegant account of Hutchinson's life and work, including the reasons that Hutchinson's teachings threatened the fabric of Puritan theology. By the time she was born, her father, Francis Marbury, had already been in and out of jail for challenging the religious authority of the Anglican priests in England. His continuing nonconformity, according to LaPlante, had a lasting impact on Hutchinson's own views of religious authority. Hutchinson also learned from the Reverend John Cotton that God's revelation to individuals occurred mystically as a kind of inner light and did not require a formal religious setting. After she moved to the colonies with her husband, William Hutchinson, she began to teach that men and women could attain salvation not through performing religious works but through this inward grace. The Puritans, who emphasized that the covenant of works was the only guarantee of salvation, charged her with antinomianism (an attack against the law of God) and with violating God's commands that a woman should not teach. LaPlante offers a stimulating account of Hutchinson's eloquent self-defense at her trial. Knowing that the magistrates had no religious or political grounds to convict her, since a woman was not a subject of the law, Hutchinson stymied their questioning. LaPlante's first-rate biography offers glimpses into the life and teachings of a much-neglected figure in early American religious history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Deckard travels this oedipal path in <i>Blade Runner</i> (1982) when he learns that he might be the enemy he has been ordered to pursue. Ecological awareness takes this shape because ecological phenomena have a loop form that is also fundamental to the structure of how things are.<br><br>The logistics of agricultural society resulted in global warming and hardwired dangerous ideas about life-forms into the human mind. Dark ecology puts us in an uncanny position of radical self-knowledge, illuminating our place in the biosphere and our belonging to a species in a sense that is far less obvious than we like to think. Morton explores the logical foundations of the ecological crisis, which is suffused with the melancholy and negativity of coexistence yet evolving, as we explore its loop form, into something playful, anarchic, and comedic. His work is a skilled fusion of humanities and scientific scholarship, incorporating the theories and findings of philosophy, anthropology, literature, ecology, biology, and physics. Morton hopes to reestablish our ties to nonhuman beings and to help us rediscover the playfulness and joy that can brighten the dark, strange loop we traverse.</p><p>A philosophical and historical account of our ecological crisis and a roadmap for the way forward.Timothy Morton is Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University.

Revered by some and reviled by many, Monsieur Arthens has been lording it over the world's most esteemed chefs for years, passing judgment on their creations, deciding their fates with a stroke of his pen, destroying and building reputations on a whim. But now, during these his final hours, his mind has turned to simpler things. He is desperately searching for that singular flavor, that sublime something once sampled, never forgotten, <i>the Flavor</i> par excellence. Indeed, this flamboyant and self-absorbed man desires only one thing before he dies: one last taste. <br><br> Thus begins a charming voyage that traces the career of Monsieur Arthens from childhood to maturity across a celebration of all manner of culinary delights. Alternating with the voice of the supercilious Arthens is a chorus belonging to his acquaintances and familiars&#x2015;relatives, lovers, a would-be prot�g�, even a cat. Each will have his or her say about M. Arthens, a man who has inspired only extreme emotions in people. Here, as in <i>The Elegance of Hedgehog</i>, Muriel Barbery's story celebrates life's simple pleasures and sublime moments while condemning the arrogance and vulgarity of power.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2009:</strong> Proust's infamous <em>madeleine</em> cannot hold a candle to the lush, winsome memories of meals past that you'll find in Muriel Barbery's <em>Gourmet Rhapsody</em>. M. Pierre Arthens is France's premier restaurant critic&#x2014;so premier in fact that he's simply called the Ma�tre&#x2014;and we meet him as he lies in bed, waiting to die. Fervently he mines years of gastronomic delights and discoveries in search of one single flavor, one that he says is "the only true thing ever accomplished." What unfolds&#x2014;in vignettes narrated by him and by a chorus of his familiars (most human, some quite comically not)&#x2014;is a portrait of a man in thrall to the very ingredient that makes French cuisine so inescapably, ecstatically, seductive: It's not cream, nor cognac, but the cook who defines those glorious tastes. "The only true work of art, in the end," he says, "is another person's feast." --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em><br> <p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Muriel Barbery and Alison Anderson on <em>Gourmet Rhapsody</em></strong><br></p> <strong>Amazon.com</strong>: What was it like returning to <em>rue de Grenelle</em> in <em>Gourmet Rhapsody</em>, after working on <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em>? <br><br><strong>Alison Anderson</strong>: I missed Ren�e (we only see her briefly, and she's grumpier than usual) and Paloma! This <em>rue de Grenelle</em> was a far more gloomy place, given both the character of Monsieur Arthens and the circumstances. But the dog and the cat provided some comic relief, and there are some lovely excursions away from <em>rue de Grenelle</em> (I particularly enjoyed the farm in Normandy...). <p></p> <strong>Amazon.com</strong>: Do you see yourself writing more novels set in Number 7, <em>rue de Grenelle</em>? <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: No, I think I am through with this locale. And it was by chance, I didn't plan to set my second novel in the same place as the first one. I have been lucky enough to have travelled a lot over the last two or three years and now I long for new literary horizons. Besides, the setting was not very important for me. It provided a means of amusing myself by deploying a satirical tone, but this is absolutely not the point in either novel. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: This story teems with the Ma�tre's lush, intimate memories of meals past. Are any of these memories your own? Do you have a favorite among them, or a personal food memory you could tell our readers about? <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: I am an ordinary person and as it is for all of us, it is for me: food is linked with very early and intimate memories. All great chefs have such blessed remembrances of precocious culinary ecstasies. And those of the novel are mine, of course. I couldn't describe emotions and feelings that are not authentic. When I read it over, I think that the whiskey moment makes the greatest impression on me, because it was at the same time intense and unexpected. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: The Ma�tre is a caustic, cryptic kind of character (outside of his own recollections), compared to Renee Michel, whose quirky intelligence endears you to her. Which is more challenging for you to write: a person you love or a person you hate? <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: Both are easy and difficult to exactly the same extent. They match with different moments of my life; I don't choose the characters: they blossom naturally at an uncontrollable moment and I just try to follow their voice. But I spent much more time with Ren�e than with Pierre Arthens; this was a moment of writing infused with pure joy, with a feeling of freedom I had not felt when writing my first novel. I felt free to write with no fetters, for the mere intoxication of abandoning myself to all the sensations and emotions this voice was offering to me. She led me much further than I could have ever imagined. <br><br>But on the other hand, adopting Arthens's voice was an extraordinary experience: the voice of a man, a brutal one, without qualms or remorse, extremely distant from my own character, was a matchless means of addressing some significant matters I otherwise wouldn't have dared to evoke. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: Could you tell us more about Muriel Barbery&#x2019;s style? What in the original text helped you impart the emotional force found in the chorus of characters that make up <em>Gourmet Rhapsody</em>? <br><br><strong>Alison Anderson</strong>: Muriel's prose is not easy to translate, but it is among the most rewarding I have ever worked with. She loves words, loves expressing herself, and a translator can tell when a text has been carefully written, so conveying the intent I mentioned above becomes the main issue. If I could taste the sashimi, or the tomatoes, in <em>Une gourmandise</em> [Editor's note: the French title of <em>Gourmet Rhapsody</em>], the reader of the English version has to be able to taste them too, so that's where I sometimes rely on my experience as a novelist...how to get that sensation across. And as I mentioned above, with regard to the chorus of characters, if I find the right balance between the original and my own "version" or reading of the text, it should work in the English...again, because Muriel wrote so well, so precisely, in <em>Une gourmandise</em>, the signposts were in the text pointing me in the right direction in English. I don't work with an overall vision for the text the way the author might, other than achieving consistency in style and voice, and that's really a question of word by word, phrase by phrase. I work with the leaves and the trees, not the forest....<br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: You thank the renowned French chef Pierre Gagnaire at the close of the novel. What was his role in your inspiration for the Ma�tre&#x2019;s story? <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: When I wrote the novel, I could not afford to go to fancy restaurants. But I wanted to write a scene in just such a setting, to show the contrast between complexity and simplicity, luxury and raw, rough but deep sensations. I had heard him speaking about his art, and he spoke with great poetry. I sent him a letter asking for a <em>carte</em> and a <em>menu </em>of his restaurant. I used it in the chapter about the mayonnaise. I often think that denominations of dishes in French restaurants are slightly or frankly ridiculous and pompous. But sometimes it's beautiful. In this case, I enjoyed reading his <em>carte </em>a lot.<br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: The idea of a "last meal" is a seductive one, and certainly a hard choice. We won&#x2019;t give away the Ma�tre&#x2019;s final feast, but we are curious to know what you&#x2019;d choose. <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: It's a very personal and intimate question, indeed. If I write novels, it's because I need fiction to put what I feel into words. And who knows what one would choose? The imminence of death is an extraordinary and radical counselor. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: How involved are you in the translation process? Would you compare it at all to having a piece of work adapted for stage or screen? <br><br><strong>Muriel Barbery</strong>: Unfortunately, my level of English does not allow me to be as involved as I would like to be. I am very interested in the issue of translation, precisely because it's completely different from the challenges associated with other forms of adaptation. Novels are pure language before they are stories suitable for adaptation in other fields. How can the translator respect the spirit of the text while drawing in the genius and idiosyncrasies of his/her own language? This implies a complete reinvention within a framework that he or she is coerced into. And I adore comparing texts: it illuminates aspects of my own language.<br><br>Mainly, I am incredibly lucky to have such an excellent translator in Alison Anderson: I made a few remarks about the first version but it was already close to perfection. And I was amazed to discover the solutions she chose for very difficult passages. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: You are both a novelist and a translator. How would you compare the two roles? <br><br><strong>Alison Anderson</strong>: They're very different. When I'm translating, I'm relieved of the responsibility of creating characters, developing a certain style, plotting&#x2014;all the elements that put your creativity (and your soul) on the line, as a novelist. With translation your responsibility is to the author's text and words and you don't have the freedom to invent, or go off on a tangent. You have to be faithful to someone else's creativity. But at the same time there is a very pleasurable freedom in working with words, without the burden of having to make up the narrative. <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong>: How did you find your way to literary translation? Given the enormous success of <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em>, do you think there is more opportunity now to expose U.S. readers to works of translation? <br><br><strong>Alison Anderson</strong>: I trained as an "international organization" translator but then didn't find work. I was a sailing enthusiast and the French are great single-handed sailors so I translated a single-handed round-the-world chronicle and it actually was published! That gave me the confidence to try fiction, and eventually establish contacts in the literary world, through the American Literary Translators' Association. <br><br>It is my sincere hope that <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em> will encourage more people to read books in translation. There is an unfortunate perception in the US that translated books are difficult or academic, (which can be true as many translations are published by university presses, who select the "cream" of foreign literature, often experimental works that may not be easily accessible to the "average" reader), but <em>Hedgehog</em> proves that there is an appetite for foreign fiction, and that there are many books being written in other languages that are enriching and humorous and well-written, and that offer a whole world for readers to discover. I believe all types of literature deserve to be sampled in English (just as they are in German or French, or the vast majority of other languages in the world!) The boom in Scandinavian crime fiction is an interesting phenomenon for example, and books like these and Muriel Barbery&#x2019;s may open up the way for many more translations. Let's hope so.<br><br><b>Muriel Barbery</b>&nbsp;was born in 1969 in Casablanca.

Yet despite the attention lavished on this epic battle by historians, much about it has been greatly misunderstood or hidden from view&#x2014;as David Glantz, the world's foremost authority on the Red Army in World War II, now shows. <br><br>This first volume in Glantz's masterly trilogy draws on previously unseen or neglected sources to provide the definitive account of the opening phase of this iconic Eastern Front campaign. Glantz has combed daily official records from both sides&#x2014;including the Red Army General Staff, the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the German Sixth Army, and the Soviet 62nd Army&#x2014;to produce a work of unparalleled detail and fresh interpretations. Jonathan House, an authority on twentieth-century warfare, adds further insight and context. <br><br>Hitler's original objective was not Stalingrad but the Caucasus oilfields to the south of the city. So he divided his Army Group South into two parts-one to secure the city on his flank, one to capture the oilfields. Glantz reveals for the first time how Stalin, in response, demanded that the Red Army stand and fight rather than withdraw, leading to the numerous little-known combat engagements that seriously eroded the Wehrmacht's strength before it even reached Stalingrad. He shows that, although advancing German forces essentially destroyed the armies of the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts, the Soviets resisted the German advance much more vigorously than has been thought through constant counterattacks, ultimately halting the German offensive at the gates of Stalingrad. <br><br>This fresh, eye-opening account and the subsequent companion volumes&#x2014;on the actual battle for the city itself and the successful Soviet counteroffensive that followed&#x2014;will dramatically revise and expand our understanding of what remains a military campaign for the ages.<br><br></p><p>"A magisterial new survey that draws on a wealth of previously inaccessible Red Army records and will be indispensable reading for all serious students of the battle."--Michael K.

She needed only to park her car and use the private elevator to the penthouse suite of Jimenez Properties; she would be at her desk in the little office next to that of her boss, Manuel Jimenez, when he arrived, promptly at eight o'clock, as was his habit.</p><p>As she parked her new Toyota Avalon in the reserved space, next to that of her boss, she was surprised and not a little annoyed to see that his Mercedes was already in its spot. She was going to have to start coming in earlier, she thought; she couldn't have Manny getting there before she did.</p><p>There was something odd about the Mercedes, she realized, through the fog of her recent sleep. Until she had her morning coffee, a double espresso, she would not think quickly. She sat in the Toyota with the motor still running while she tried to figure it out.</p><p>The lights, she decided. The interior lights of the Mercedes were on, and unless she turned them off, Manny would soon have a dead battery. She gathered her small briefcase, purse, coffee thermos, and the <b>Miami Herald</b> and struggled out of her car. She set her things down on the driver's seat and smoothed her skirt before continuing. She was looking forward to reading Carl Hiassen's column in the paper before doing any real work. She loved Hiassen, read all his novels, too, and never missed his column.</p><p>She gathered her things once again, closed the car door, and pressed the button on the remote control to lock all the doors and the trunk. Some cars had been broken into in this garage, in spite of the security cameras. She wished Manny had sprung for a garage with a manned entrance, instead of the electronic surveillance; a guard on duty made her feel safer. Embracing her belongings, she walked around Manny's car and saw immediately why the interior lights were on: the driver's door was open. She took another step or two, reaching out for the door, then she peered over the things in her arms and saw what they had concealed until now.</p><p>Manny Jimenez was lying on the garage floor in an oddly contorted position.</p><p>Heart attack! Sara thought immediately. She had taken a CPR course at her church, and she knew exactly what to do. She put her things on the garage floor, reached out to Manny, and turned him over. Manny had not had a heart attack. A heart attack did not put a hole in his head, and particularly, did not spray his blood and brains across the inside of the Mercedes door. Sara did not pause to take Manny's pulse or put her ear to his chest. He was stiff as a board, and she knew what that meant. She picked up her things and ran for the elevator. As soon as she had opened the door with her key, she was digging in her briefcase for her cellphone.</p><p>Steven Steinberg stood on the eighteenth tee of the Doral Country Club's famous course, the Blue Monster, and gazed down the fairway, utterly relaxed and confident. He had played this schmuck from New York like a violin, and now he was going to take his money. Even though Steinberg had an official handicap of six, and even though he should have carried a card that said three, he had allowed his guest to play him neck and neck for seventeen holes. They were now tied at eleven over par, and it was time to crank the handle on the cash register.</p><p>Steinberg took his stance, his right foot back a couple of extra inches, and without a practice swing, hit the ball. It started to the right, then turned over and dropped into the middle of the fairway, two hundred and seventy yards down the course.</p><p>Fleischman stared after the ball with an expression of disbelief on his face.</p><p>"Something wrong?" Steinberg asked.</p><p>"Nothing at all," Fleischman replied, teeing up. He swung mightily at the ball and sliced it into a fairway bunker, two hundred and twenty yards down the fairway. He picked up his tee. "So how come, all of a sudden, after seventeen holes, you're outdriving me?"</p><p>Steinberg shrugged. "Every now and then I really connect. Don't you, sometimes?"</p><p>"Sometimes," Fleischman said. "But not usually on the eighteenth, and not for that kind of length."</p><p>They got into Steinberg's customized golf cart. "You know what I'd do if I were you?" he said to his guest.</p><p>"No, Steven, what would you do?"</p><p>"I'd take a seven wood and go for it."</p><p>"Out of a bunker?"</p><p>"Why not? It's a shallow bunker; there's enough loft on a seven wood to carry the edge, and you'd find yourself a nice little wedge from the flag. You got a seven wood? You want to borrow mine?" At this stage, he could afford to appear to be generous.</p><p>"I've got a seven wood," Fleischman said as the cart drew to a halt next to the bunker. He looked down the fairway toward the flag, checked the depth of the bunker, and pulled his seven wood from his bag.</p><p>"Come on," Steinberg said, "you can do it."</p><p>Fleischman lined up his shot. "Keep it smooth," he muttered to himself. "Nice easy shot." He swung the club and connected beautifully with the ball. It faded a little but dropped in the fairway, maybe eighty yards from the pin.</p><p>"Great shot!" Steinberg said.</p><p>"Thanks for the tip," Fleischman replied, getting into the cart.</p><p>They stopped next to Steinberg's ball. He didn't even glance down the fairway, just went to his bag and came back with a fairway wood.</p><p>"What are you doing with that club?" Fleischman asked. "It's only a hundred and sixty yards to the flag; you'll knock it into the next county."</p><p>"This is an eleven wood," Steinberg replied, lining up on the ball. He relaxed, took a breath and let it out, and took a slow-looking, liquid swing at the ball. It rose high into the air, sailed down the fairway, past the guarding bunkers, and dropped onto the green with only a single bounce, stopping four feet from the pin.</p><p>"I'm getting one of those," Fleischman muttered.</p><p>"You should," Steinberg replied, still holding his finish.</p><p>Then Steinberg's head exploded.</p><p>For a tiny second before he screamed, Fleischman wondered if cheating at golf could make your head explode.</p><p><b>&#x2014;</b>Reprinted from Blood Orchid: A Holly Barker Novel by Stuart Woods by permission of G.P.

Sent to the notorious labor camp Yodok when he was nine years old, Kang observed frequent public executions and endured forced labor and near-starvation rations for ten years. In 1992, he escaped to South Korea, where he found God and now advocates for human rights in North Korea.<br>Part horror story, part historical document, part memoir, part political tract, this book brings together unassailable firsthand experience, setting one young man's personal suffering in the wider context of modern history, giving eyewitness proof to the abuses perpetrated by the North Korean regime.<br></p><p><b>Kang Chol-Hwan</b> is founder and president of the North Korea Strategy Center.<br><br> <b>Pierre Rigoulot</b> is a journalist, historian, and human rights activist living in Paris, France. He is the author of numerous books on the history of political repression and contributed the North Korean chapter to the bestselling <i>The Black Book of Communism</i>.North Korea is among the most opaque nations on earth, its regime noted for repression and for the personality cult of its father and son leaders, the late Kim Il Sung and his successor, Kim Jong Il. Kang Chol-hwan draws from firsthand experience in explaining the repression. After the division of North and South Korea, Kang's family returned to North Korea from Japan, where his grandparents had emigrated in the 1930s and where his grandfather had amassed a fortune and his grandmother became a committed Communist. They were fired with idealism and committed to building an edenic nation. Instead, the family was removed without trial to a remote concentration camp, apparently because the grandfather was suspected of counter-revolutionary tendencies. Kang Chol-hwan was nine years old when imprisoned at the Yodok camp in 1977. Over the next ten years, he endured inhumane conditions and deprivations, including an inadequate diet (supplemented by frogs and rats), regular beatings, humiliations and hard labor. Inexplicably released in 1987, the author states that the only lesson his imprisonment had "pounded into me was about man's limitless capacity to be vicious." Kang's memoir is notable not for its literary qualities, but for the immediacy and drama of the personal testimony. The writing, as translated by Reiner, is unadorned but serviceable, a style suited to presenting one man's account of a brutalized childhood. Kang now lives in South Korea, where he is a journalist; his co-author Rigoulot was a contributor to The Black Book of Communism. Together, they have added a chapter to the tales of horror that have come out of Asia in recent years. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Hal Leonard Ukulele Method Book 1 (with Online Audio Access)</h2><p>(Fretted).

And the dreaded government agent Jennifer Government is after him.<p> Like Steve Aylett, Alexander Besher, Douglas Coupland, Paul Di Filippo, Jim Munroe, Jeff Noon, and Chuck Palahniuk, Max Barry is an author of smartass, punky satire for the late capitalist era. It's a hip and happening field; before publication, <i>Jennifer Government</i> (Barry's second novel) was optioned by Stephen Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section 8 Films for a major motion picture. However, the level of literary accomplishment varies wildly among practitioners, from brilliant (Di Filippo and Palahniuk) to amateurish (Besher). This field is so hot, its writers needn't be nearly as accomplished as they'd have to become to break into any other form of fiction.</p><p> That said, like many of his fellow turn-of-the-millennium satirists, Barry is uneven. He has a lively imagination and a sharp eye for the absurdities and offenses of hypercorporate capitalism.

Readers are welcomed into the lives of Papua New Guinea rainforest dwellers to witness a dramatic arc of cultural change and human transformation.<p> When Knauft first studied them, Gebusi practiced powerful spirit s�ances and sorcery divinations, held resplendent initiations that included distinctive sexual customs, and endured high rates of violence. Sixteen years later, he found them participating in market activity, schooling, government programs, and sports; performing their own popular music; and practicing Christianity. More recently, Gebusi have been battered by economic hardship and withdrawal of government services but have admirably revitalized their culture and livelihood. Sustained by traditions, access to land and waterways, and a keen sense of humor and vitality, Gebusi exhibit resilience and dignity amid conditions of continuing uncertainty and change.</p><p> An absorbing, well-written, and humanistic account based on profound scholarship, <i>The Gebusi, 4/E</i> includes end-of-chapter Broader Connections that link Gebusi experiences to major anthropological topics subsistence, kinship and marriage, politics, religion, gender and sexuality, ethnicity, nationalism, modernity, and the ethics of engaged and applied anthropology. Sixty photos, including twenty in a full-color insert, accentuate Knauft's absorbing narrative. Callouts to new instructional videos recorded with Gebusi and to an extensive online image bank on the author's website enrich the ethnography.</p><p> Not-for-sale instructor's resource materials available online to college and university faculty only; contact publisher directly.</p></p><p>"I think this is a fine piece of ethnographic research.

We come back to it over and over in class to illustrate concepts in the primary text. It is very relatable as Knauft is young when he first visits the Gebusi.

Now a major motion picture starring Rooney Mara.&nbsp;<b>Sebastian Barry's latest novel,&nbsp;<i>Days Without End</i>, is now available.&nbsp;</b></b><br><br> Sebastian Barry's novels have been hugely admired by readers and critics, and in 2005 his novel <i>A Long Long Way</i> was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In <i>The Secret Scripture</i>, Barry revisits County Sligo, Ireland, the setting for his previous three books, to tell the unforgettable story of Roseanne McNulty. Once one of the most beguiling women in Sligo, she is now a resident of Roscommon Regional Mental Hospital and nearing her hundredth year. Set against an Ireland besieged by conflict, <i>The Secret Scripture</i> is an engrossing tale of one woman's life, and a poignant story of the cruelties of civil war and corrupted power.&nbsp;<i>The Secret Scripture</i> is now a film starring Rooney Mara, Eric Bana, and Vanessa Redgrave.</p><p>Sebastian Barry was born in Dublin in 1955. His plays include <i>Boss Grady's Boys</i> (1988), <i>The Steward of Christendom</i> (1995), <i>Our Lady of Sligo</i> (1998), <i>The Pride of Parnell Street</i> (2007), and <i>Dallas Sweetman</i> (2008). Among his novels are <i>The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty</i> (1998), <i>Annie Dunne</i> (2002) and <i>A Long Long Way</i> (2005), the latter shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

His awards include the Irish-America Fund Literary Award, The Christopher Ewart-Biggs Prize, the London Critics Circle Award, The Kerry Group Irish Fiction Prize, and Costa Awards for Best Novel and Book of the Year. He lives in Wicklow with his wife Ali, and three children, Merlin, Coral, and Tobias.Lucky listeners receive the gift of a great narrator and an amazing writer in THE SECRET SCRIPTURE, which was nominated for the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Ninety-nine-year-old Roseanne McNulty has been a patient in an Irish mental hospital for over 50 years. Not apparently crazy, she decides to write her story at the same time that the hospital director begins to interview her. While Rose reexamines a life lived during the Irish &#34;troubles&#34; and within the confines of a sectarian, conformist country, Dr. Grene tells his version of her story. Wanda McCaddon&#39;s exquisite reading illuminates the lyrical writing, and brings listeners deep into the book&#39;s explosive emotions. Rose&#39;s determined Irish lilt, a priest&#39;s oily tones, Dr. Grene&#39;s fragile neutrality. It&#39;s all here, and it&#39;s terrific. A.C.S.

Secrecy--its possible convenience, its price, and even its civility--hovers throughout the novel. A Heart So White becomes a sort of anti-detective story of human nature. Intrigue; the sins of the father; the fraudulent and the genuine; marriage and strange repetitions of violence: Mar�as elegantly sends shafts of inquisitory light into shadows and onto the costs of ambivalence.</p><p>Javier Mar�as was born in Madrid in 1951. He has published ten novels, two collections of short stories and several volumes of essays. His work has been translated into thirty-two languages and won a dazzling array of interna�tional literary awards, including the prestigious Dublin IMPAC award for <i>A Heart So White</i>. He is also a highly practiced translator into Spanish of English authors, including Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Thomas Browne and Laurence Sterne. He has held academic posts in Spain, the United States and in Britain, as Lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br><br><i><br><br>I think it was Faulkner who once said that when you strike a match in a dark wilderness it is not in order to see anything better lighted, but just in order to see how much more darkness there is around. I think that literature does mainly that. It is not really supposed to &#x2018;answer&#x2019; things, not even to make them clearer, but rather to explore &#x2013; often blindly &#x2013; the huge areas of darkness, and show them better</i>.<br>This was Javier Mar�as&#x2019;s response to an online interviewer who asked him, &#x2018;What is the purpose of writing?&#x2019;, and it not only provides an unexpectedly lucid answer to that intimidating question; it also directly illuminates Mar�as&#x2019;s own practice, and that of A Heart So White in particular. For this is a novel which asks the profoundest, most unsettling questions about knowledge itself: about human curiosity, about the keeping of secrets, about our need to know the truth and our (sometimes equally pressing) need not to know it; and about language, too &#x2013; for knowledge can only be imparted in words, and words, as writers know only too well, are slippery, unreliable, and have a tendency to falsify the very truths they are meant to impart.<br><br>Most novelists have a &#x2018;breakthrough&#x2019; book, the one that introduces them to a wider public: in the case of Mar�as it was All Souls (Todas las almas), published in 1989. Offering up the simple pleasures of traditional fiction rather more willingly than some of Mar�as&#x2019;s subsequent work, it tells the story of a Spanish academic who comes to Oxford and has an affair with a fellow-tutor, and has some points of contact with the &#x2018;campus novel&#x2019; genre so beloved of Anglo-Saxon comic writers. A Heart So White (Coraz�n tan blanco) followed in 1992, hard on the heels of that success, but there is not much sense here of a writer compromising himself in order to accommodate a larger, less specialized readership. The wisp of a plot can be summarized in a few words &#x2013; newlywed translator learns the deadly secret behind his father&#x2019;s three marriages &#x2013; but it is a more opaque, demanding work than its predecessor. The novel&#x2019;s long, looping opening sentence sets the agenda at once:<br><i><br>I did not want to know but I have since come to know that one of the girls, when she wasn&#x2019;t a girl anymore and hadn&#x2019;t long been back from her honeymoon, went into the bathroom, stood in front of the mirror, unbuttoned her blouse, took off her bra and aimed her own father&#x2019;s gun at her heart, her father at the time was in the dining room with other members of the family and three guests. (p.3)<br></i><br>Notice, first of all, what a strange, violent temporal journey we make while negotiating the jumble of tenses in that sentence. We start (&#x2018;I did not want to know&#x2019;) at some unspecified point in the past, then (&#x2018;have since come to know&#x2019;) move forward, then (&#x2018;when she wasn&#x2019;t a girl anymore&#x2019;) rewind even further into the past and then (&#x2018;hadn&#x2019;t long been back from her honeymoon&#x2019;) locate ourselves a little more exactly within this timeframe, and so on. Any promise of a conventionally linear narrative is immediately shattered, and we are already made aware, subliminally, of one of the novel&#x2019;s major themes: the evanescence of human experience, the fact that everything belongs to the past as soon as it has happened, the fact that &#x2018;everything is constantly in the process of being lost&#x2019;.<br><br>This might, of course, easily be described as a Proustian theme, and indeed the length and complexity of Mar�as&#x2019;s sentences have evoked stylistic comparisons with Proust, as well as with Henry James and Thomas Bernhard. But we would do well to remember that, earlier in his career, Mar�as had a distinguished parallel life as a translator, and probably his most celebrated translation was his Spanish rendering of Tristram Shandy. Because he is not the most obviously humorous of novelists, it might be tempting to downplay the extent of Mar�as&#x2019;s affinities with Laurence Sterne: but they seem to me just as strong as his links with the great twentieth-century European writers. Like Sterne, Mar�as is prey to a radical scepticism about the novel&#x2019;s capacity to render the complexity of subjective human experience in anything other than the crudest, most approximate way. Like Sterne, too, he is possessed by the notion that some of the smallest and most fleeting events in our lives are also the most significant; that these events occupy a space in our memories which seems quite out of proportion to their original duration; and that writers must therefore develop ever more inventive strategies that will give such transient but momentous events their narrative due.<br><br>There the resemblance more or less ends: for Mar�as, unlike Sterne, inclines towards narrative subversions which are po-faced rather than zany or farcical. One of his methods, for instance, is a highly distinctive form of repetition. Many novelists are scared of repetition, assuming that readers will take it for laziness or carelessness. Mar�as, on the other hand, realizes that our thought processes are often repetitious, and he wants to render this quality as scrupulously as possible. Thus we will find the narrator of A Heart So White reflecting that,<br><br><i><br><br>What takes place is identical to what doesn&#x2019;t take place, what we dismiss or allow to slip by us is identical to what we accept and seize, what we experience identical to what we never try, and yet we spend our lives in a process of choosing and rejecting and selecting, in drawing a line to separate these identical things and make of our story a unique story that we can remember and that can be told. (p.28)</i><br>Almost two hundred and fifty pages later, when the narrator has overheard a crucial conversation between his wife and his father, and has at last become privy to his father&#x2019;s secrets, he writes:<br><i>Sometimes I have the feeling that what takes place is identical to what doesn&#x2019;t take place, what we dismiss or allow to slip by us identical to what we accept and seize, what we experience identical to what we never try, and yet we spend our lives in a process of choosing and rejecting and selecting, in drawing a line to separate these identical things and make of our story a unique story that we can remember and that can be recounted, either now or at the end of time, and thus can be erased or swept away, the annulment of everything we are and do. (p.272)<br></i><br>Among other things, there is a certain rueful world-weariness about this technique: one of the things Mar�as is trying to tell the reader, it seems, is that no matter how much we experience, no matter how shocking or intense our experiences are, we remain locked within the same patterns of thought and reflection. One usually closes a Mar�as novel with the sense that human experience is immutable, and that people themselves rarely change. The precedent, again, might come from Sterne, although again Mar�as expresses the idea calmly and regretfully, with little of Sterne&#x2019;s cavorting humour.<br><br>The notion that &#x2018;what we experience is identical to what we never try&#x2019; has another consequence: not for Mar�as&#x2019;s characters, this time, but for his literary aesthetic. It makes him sceptical of the line dividing fiction from non-fiction: a scepticism he shares with many other European writers poised on the cusp of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Two obvious examples might be Milan Kundera (whose books were, as our narrator is somewhat tiredly aware, highly fashionable at the time when A Heart So White was written) and W. G. Sebald. Like Sebald, Mar�as likes to include photographs in his fictions (there are photographs in both All Souls and Your Face Tomorrow), leaving the reader with nagging uncertainties as to whether they are real or fake. And, like Sebald, he is just as interested &#x2013; more interested, it might be argued &#x2013; in reflection and analysis than he is in narration. A typical Mar�as sentence might begin with the description of an event, but this act of telling will rapidly morph into something discursive.</p><h2>The Ecological Indian: Myth and History</h2><p><p><strong>"A good story and first-rate social science."&#x2015;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> The idea of the Native American living in perfect harmony with nature is one of the most cherished contemporary myths. But how truthful is this larger-than-life image? According to anthropologist Shepard Krech, the first humans in North America demonstrated all of the intelligence, self-interest, flexibility, and ability to make mistakes of human beings anywhere. As Nicholas Lemann put it in <em>The New Yorker</em>, "Krech is more than just a conventional-wisdom overturner; he has a serious larger point to make. . . . Concepts like ecology, waste, preservation, and even the natural (as distinct from human) world are entirely anachronistic when applied to Indians in the days before the European settlement of North America." "Offers a more complex portrait of Native American peoples, one that rejects mythologies, even those that both European and Native Americans might wish to embrace."&#x2015;<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>Shepard Krech III is a professor of anthropology at Brown University. He lives in Providence, Rhode Island, and in Maine.Iron Eyes Cody, the Weeping Indian, was a fraud, and so, says Krech, is the image of the American Indian as protoecologist. When, in 1971, Keep America Beautiful used Cody (an Italian-American who passed himself off as a Native American) as its antipollution icon, it furthered a then-emerging view of American Indians as somehow better people vis-...-vis the land than the Europeans who supplanted them. That view gained popularity in later years, helped along by advocates like Vine Deloria, a Sioux historian and attorney, who said, The Indian lived with his land. The white destroyed his land. He destroyed the planet Earth. But, writes Brown University anthropologist Krech, there is little historical basis for the notion that Indians were any more responsible caretakers of the land and its nonhuman denizens than were contemporary Europeans. While this image, he writes, may occasionally serve useful polemical or political ends, images of noble . . . indigenousness, including the Ecological Indian, are ultimately dehumanizing. They deny both variation within human groups and commonalities between them. Krech goes on to examine a number of case studies to show that Indians were not the protoecologists of modern environmentalists dreams: several Great Lakes tribes, for example, hunted the beaver nearly to extinction in the region; southern tribes similarly overhunted the white-tailed deer; migratory Great Plains bands regularly exhausted game supplies in their home areas and were thus forced to move on, expanding their historic territories and coming into conflict with other Native groups that claimed the same land; southwestern tribes may have overwatered their fields, ruining them with accumulated salt deposits. These unfortunate actions, Krech suggests, do not mean that the Indians were guilty of a program of wanton despoliation; they mean that the Indians were human, capable of mistakes. Krechs case studies deliver nothing new to the scholarly literature, but general readers may find his historical overview, though academic, to be of interest. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Good is good.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x2014;James Beard</p><p>Lots of people think they&#x2019;d love to eat for a living. Me? I&#x2019;d kill for it.</p><p>Which makes total sense, coming from my family. FTD told my mother to say it with flowers, but she said it with food. Lost a pet? Your job? Your mind? Life always felt better with a serving of Mom&#x2019;s braised short ribs or red velvet cake in your belly. In my family, we ate when happy or sad, but especially, we ate when we were worried.</p><p>The brand-new <i>Key Zest</i> magazine in Key West, Florida, announced a month ago that they were hiring a food critic for their style section. Since my idea of heaven was eating at restaurants and talking about food, I&#x2019;d do whatever it took to land the job. <i>Whatever</i>. Three review samples and a paragraph on my proposed style as their new food critic were due on Monday. Seven days and counting. So far I had produced nothing. The big goose egg. Call me Hayley Catherine &#x201c;Procrastination&#x201d; Snow.</p><p>To be fair to me, some of the blockage could be traced to the fact that Kristen Faulkner&#x2014;my ex&#x2019;s new girlfriend and the woman whose cream sauce I&#x2019;d most like to curdle&#x2014;happened to be the co-owner of <i>Key Zest</i>. What if she judged the restaurants I chose impossibly lowbrow? What if she deleted my application packet the minute it hit her inbox? Or, worst of all, what if I landed the job and had to rub shoulders with her ice-queen highness every day?</p><p>My psychologist friend Eric had suggested ever so sweetly that it was time to quit thinking and start eating. Hence, I was hurrying along Olivia Street to meet him for dinner at one of my favorite restaurants on the island, Seven Fish. Of course, I&#x2019;d left my roommate&#x2019;s houseboat late because I couldn&#x2019;t decide what to wear. I winnowed it down to two outfits and asked Evinrude, my gray tiger cat, to choose. Black jeans and a form-fitting white T-shirt with my shin-high, butt-kicking, red cowgirl boots? Or the cute flowered sundress with a cabled hoodie? From his perch on the desk, the cat twitched his tail and said nothing. But I bet Kristen would never go for &#x201c;cute.&#x201d; I shimmied into the jeans, scrunched a teaspoon of hair product into my still-damp auburn curls, and set out at a fast clip.</p><p>Eric also pointed out not too long ago that I didn&#x2019;t seem to have the knack for figuring in the time it would take to get somewhere when I made plans. Did I think I would get airlifted from one place to another instead of walking or driving my scooter? I pointed out that if he wanted any friends left, he might want to save his psychoanalysis for his paying customers. But I doubted either of us was going to change.</p><p>Tonight was the kind of night that made people pine for Key West if they&#x2019;d ever spent time here and left, and celebrate the good decision making that brought them if they&#x2019;d stayed. The small, side-by-side conch-style homes I passed along Olivia Street weren&#x2019;t fancy, but a fringe of palm trees and pink bougainvillea wound with twinkling white lights made them look like fairy tale material. Add in weather just cool enough for a sweater, the gentle burbling of hidden fountains, and a couple of roosters pecking in the dust alongside the road, and it definitely felt like paradise. My slice of paradise. Light-years from a gray and dreary New Jersey November.</p><p>I broke into a trot as I approached the cemetery on the right, its listing, weathered stones protected by the iron bars of the surrounding fence. Despite the fascinating history of the tombs, which I&#x2019;d heard as I rattled by on a conch tour train when I arrived three months ago, the place spooked me out. Town officials did their best to keep folks out of the cemetery at night, but still, our local paper, the <i>Key West Citizen</i>, reported regular incidents such as headstones being tipped over and encampments of homeless teenagers. Each fluttering shadow made my heart jump.</p><p>And then one shadow came to life. I let loose a screech loud enough to be heard all the way to Miami.</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, miss,&#x201d; said a skinny man in a battered cowboy hat. &#x201c;Could ya spare some change?&#x201d;</p><p>I knew you weren&#x2019;t supposed to give money to bums, especially ones that smelled like a day&#x2019;s worth of drinking, as this guy did. Editorials in the newspaper insisted that only perpetuated the problem. The cowboy moved closer, wheezing his boozy breath and smiling to reveal two missing incisors. My heart thrummed faster and I clutched the strap of my shoulder bag. There but for the grace of some capricious God could have been me.</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t eaten since yesterday,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Now I felt sick at the prospect of gorging myself at a nice restaurant while he, drunk or not, went hungry. I dug in my pocket and dropped a crumpled dollar bill and some loose change into his dirty palm, wishing I had more, but that&#x2019;s all there was. Then I waved off his mumbled thanks and rushed by.</p><p>Up ahead on the left-hand side of the street, a cluster of people holding wineglasses milled on the sidewalk in front of an unassuming glass and concrete block building&#x2014;home of Seven Fish. Eric was already there, wearing his white Oxford shirt and nerd glasses&#x2014;he would never be late worrying about how to dress because his outfit was always some version of the same thing. He carried two glasses of wine: one red, one white.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Spanish Albari�o,&#x201d; he said, handing me the white and pecking me on the cheek. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just clearing our table now.&#x201d; He snuck a glance at his watch but managed not to mention my lateness. I got the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant.&#x201d; I sipped, tasting overtones of apricot and peach. &#x201c;Hope you&#x2019;re hungry, because we need to try a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>Which I didn&#x2019;t have to say because he knew the deal: He was in charge of making the reservations just in case someone might recognize me as a potential food critic (in my dreams) and I&#x2019;d order for both of us so I could sample a range of their dishes. A dark-haired man swathed in a chest-to-knee white apron called out Eric&#x2019;s name. We followed him inside, past the four-seater bar to a room no bigger than my houseboat, and plainly furnished, without my roommate&#x2019;s tendency to tropical upholstery. He deposited us at a tiny table at the far end of the room. I took the seat facing the iron fish sculpture on the back wall so I wouldn&#x2019;t be distracted with people-watching&#x2014;or, even worse, absorb their opinions about the food.</p><p>Within minutes, the waiter came around and described the specials, including yellowtail in a mild curry sauce and saut�ed grouper sushi rolls. I salivated with anticipation like a rat pressing a lever in a psychology experiment. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re good to go,&#x201d; I said, and began to list the dishes I needed to try. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start with the fish tacos, the grouper rolls, and a small Caesar salad with a crab cake on the side. For the main course, the gentleman will have the chicken with bananas and walnuts&#x201d;&#x2014;I grinned as Eric&#x2019;s face fell&#x2014;&#x201c;and I&#x2019;ll try your special curried yellowtail. And we&#x2019;ll have a meat loaf for the table.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; asked the waiter, deadpan.</p><p>&#x201c;Two more glasses of wine. And no bread please.&#x201d; I smiled and handed him my menu. &#x201c;Oh, what the heck, add the grilled mahi-mahi with roasted potatoes, too.&#x201d; He finished writing and swished off toward the kitchen.</p><p>Eric leaned forward to whisper, &#x201c;He has to know something&#x2019;s up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We could be very, very hungry.&#x201d; I thought of the cowboy lurking near the cemetery.</p><p>Eric excused himself to hit the men&#x2019;s room. I whipped out my smartphone to check e-mail just in case one of the freelance articles I&#x2019;d submitted on spec to the <i>Key West Citizen</i> had been accepted. The subject line of the third message down jolted me hard: &#x201c;Food critic applications due Friday.&#x201d; The deadline for application packets had been moved up. Staff at <i>Key Zest</i> would only consider those that...</p></p><h2>The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation</h2><p>This extraordinary book can be read on several levels. Primarily, it is the story of Joseph Jacotot, an exiles French schoolteacher who discovered in 1818 an unconventional teaching method that spread panic throughout the learned community of Europe.<br>Knowing no Flemish, Jacotot found himself able to teach in French to Flemish students who knew no French; knowledge, Jacotot concluded, was not necessary to teach, nor explication necessary to learn. The results of this unusual experiment in pedagogy led him to announce that all people were equally intelligent. From this postulate, Jacotot devised a philosophy and a method for what he called "intellectual emancipation"&#x2015;a method that would allow, for instance, illiterate parents to themselves teach their children how to read. The greater part of the book is devoted to a description and analysis of Jacotot's method, its premises, and (perhaps most important) its implications for understanding both the learning process and the emancipation that results when that most subtle of hierarchies, intelligence, is overturned.<br>The book, as Kristin Ross argues in her introduction, has profound implications for the ongoing debate about education and class in France that has raged since the student riots of 1968, and it affords Ranci�re an opportunity (albeit indirectly) to attack the influential educational and sociological theories of Pierre Bourdieu (and others) that Ranci�re sees as perpetuating inequality.</p><p>&#x201c;An extremely provocative, original, and engaging book, it raises questions of great relevance and urgency about the process of cultural selection and canonization.&#x201d;&#x2013;Denis Hollier, Yale UniversityText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Renegades of Pern (Dragonriders of Pern Series)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[McCaffrey is the] master of the well-told tale.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></b><br><br>As long as the people of Pern could remember, the Holds had protected them from Thread, the deadly silver strands that fell from the sky. In exchange for sanctuary in the huge stone fortresses, the people tithed to their Lord Holders, who in turn supported the dragonriders, Pern&#x2019;s greatest weapon against Thread. But not everyone on Pern was protected. Some, like Jayge&#x2019;s trader clan, simply preferred the freedom of the roads to the security of a hold. Others, like Aramina&#x2019;s family, had lost their homes.

But Jayge is out to stop Thella . . .and he will never let her have Aramina.</p><p>There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editorhe people of Pern could remember, the Holds had protected them from Thread, the deadly silver strands that fell from the sky and ravaged the land.

Lake (Charismatic Classics)</h2><p>For years, readers have been fascinated by the miracles of notable healing minister John G. Lake. His adventures are renown throughout the world. Now, readers can discover the origin from which Lake&#x2019;s healing ministry was launched and witness real-life accounts of God&#x2019;s miracles through Lake&#x2019;s ministry in Africa and Washington. Lake&#x2019;s ministry was so blessed by God that while based in Spokane, Washington, the city was documented by the United States Government as &#x201c;...the healthiest city in the world....&#x201d; Packed with powerful stories, Diary of God&#x2019;s General is a must-read for anyone energized by God&#x2019;s miracles.</p><p>John G. Lake was born March 18, 1870. At the age of 21 he became a Methodist minister; however, he chose to start a newspaper instead of accepting a church ministry. In 1989, Lake&#x2019;s wife, who was seriously ill, was miraculously healed under the ministry of John Alexander Dowie. The experience forever changed the direction of Lake&#x2019;s life. He is remembered best for his missionary work in South Africa, but his ministry in the U.S. was also powerful. In just five years, 100,000 healings were recorded at the Lake healing rooms in Spokane, Washington. What he accomplished as a result of his intense regard for the Word of God is an example to all Christians of what is possible for anyone who will believe and act on the Scriptures.</p><h2>The New Tsar</h2><p>An epic tale of Vladimir Putin&#39;s path to power, as he emerged from obscurity to become one of the world&#39;s most conflicted and important leaders. Former New York TimesMoscow Bureau Chief Steven Lee Myers has followed Putin since well before the recent events in the Ukraine, and gives us the fullest and most engaging account available of his rise to power. A gripping, page-turning narrative about Russian power and prestige, the book depicts a cool and calculating leader with enormous ambition and few scruples. As the world struggles to confront a newly assertive Russia, the importance of understanding Putin has never been greater. Vladimir Putin rose out of Soviet deprivation to the pinnacle of influence in the new Russian nation. He came to office in 2000 as a reformer, cutting taxes and expanding property rights, bringing a measure of order and eventually prosperity to millions whose only experience of democracy in the early years following the Soviet collapse was instability, poverty and criminality. But soon Putin orchestrated the preservation of a new kind of authoritarianism, consolidating power, reasserting his country&#39;s might, brutally crushing revolts and swiftly dispatching dissenters, even as he retained the support of many.</p><p>Steven Lee Myers has worked at the New York Times for 22 years, five of them in Russia during the period when Putin consolidated his power. He spent two years as bureau chief in Baghdad, covering the winding down of the American war in Iraq, and now covers the State Department. He lives in Washington, DC. This is his first book.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br> Homo Sovieticus <br> &nbsp;<br> Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin edged forward through the cratered bat�tlefield beside the Neva River, roughly thirty miles from Leningrad. His orders seemed suicidal. He was to reconnoiter the German positions and, if possible, capture a &#x201c;tongue,&#x201d; slang for a soldier to interrogate. It was November 17, 1941,1 already bitterly cold, and the Soviet Union&#x2019;s humiliated army was now desperately fighting to avoid its complete destruction at the hands of Nazi Germany. The last tanks in reserve in the city had crossed the Neva a week before, and Putin&#x2019;s commanders now had orders to break through heavily reinforced positions defended by 54,000 German infantrymen. There was no choice but to obey. He and another soldier approached a foxhole along a dug-in front, carved with trenches, pocked with shell craters, stained with blood. A German suddenly rose, surprising all three of them. For a frozen moment, noth�ing happened. The German reacted first, unpinned a grenade and tossed it. It landed near Putin, killing his comrade and riddling his own legs with shrapnel. The German soldier escaped, leaving Putin for dead. &#x201c;Life is such a simple thing, really,&#x201d; a man who retold the story decades later would say, with a characteristic fatalism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Putin, then thirty years old, lay wounded on a bridgehead on the east bank of the Neva. The Red Army&#x2019;s commanders had poured troops across the river in hopes of breaking the encirclement of Leningrad that had begun two months earlier when the Germans captured Shlisselburg, an ancient fortress at the mouth of the Neva, but the effort failed. The Germans laid a siege that would last 872 days and kill a million civil�ians by bombardment, starvation, or disease. &#x201c;The F�hrer has decided to wipe the city of Petersburg from the face of the earth,&#x201d; a secret Ger�man order declared on September 29. Surrender would not be accepted. Air and artillery bombardment would be the instrument of the city&#x2019;s destruction, and hunger would be its accomplice, since &#x201c;feeding the population cannot and should not be solved by us.&#x201d; Never before had a modern city endured a siege like it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is this the end of your losses?&#x201d; Joseph Stalin furiously cabled the city&#x2019;s defenders the day after the siege began. &#x201c;Perhaps you have already decided to give up Leningrad?&#x201d; The telegram was signed by the entire Soviet leadership, including Vyacheslav Molotov, who in 1939 had signed the notorious nonaggression pact with his Nazi counterpart, Joachim von Ribbentrop, which was now betrayed. It was by no means the end of the losses. The fall of Shlisselburg coincided with ferocious air raids in Leningrad itself, including one that ignited the city&#x2019;s main food warehouse. The Soviet forces defending the city were in disarray, as they were everywhere in the Soviet Union. Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion that began on June 22, 1941, had crushed Soviet defenses along a thousand-mile front, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Even Moscow seemed in danger of falling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stalin never considered surrendering Leningrad, and he dispatched the chief of the general staff, Georgy Zhukov, to shore up the city&#x2019;s defenses, which he did with great brutality. On the night of September 19, on Zhukov&#x2019;s orders, Soviet forces mounted the first assault 600 meters across the Neva to break the siege, but it was repulsed by overwhelming German firepower. In October, they tried again, hurling forth the 86th Division, which included Putin&#x2019;s unit, the 330th Rifle Regiment. The bridgehead those troops managed to create on the eastern bank of the Neva became known, because of its size, as the Nevsky Pyatachok, from the word for a five-kopek coin or a small patch. At its greatest expanse the battlefield was barely a mile wide, less than half a mile deep. For the soldiers fated to fight there, it was a brutal, senseless death trap.<br> &nbsp;<br> Putin was an uneducated laborer, one of four sons of Spiridon Putin, a chef who once worked in the city&#x2019;s famed pre-revolutionary Astoria Hotel. Spiridon, though a supporter of the Bolsheviks, fled the impe�rial capital during the civil war and famine that followed the October Revolution in 1917. He settled in his ancestral village, Pominovo, in the rolling hills west of Moscow, and later moved to the city itself, where he cooked for Vladimir Lenin&#x2019;s widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, at her official Soviet dacha in the Gorky district on the edge of Moscow. After her death in 1939, he worked in the retreat of Moscow&#x2019;s Communist Party Committee. He was said to have cooked once for Grigory Rasputin at the Astoria and on occasion for Stalin when he visited Lenin&#x2019;s widow, beginning a family tradition of servitude to the political elite. Proxim�ity to power did nothing to protect his sons from the Nazis; the entire nation was fighting for survival.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vladimir Putin was already a veteran when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. He had served as a submariner in the 1930s before settling down not far from Leningrad, in the village of Petrodvorets, where Peter the Great had built his palace on the Gulf of Finland. In the chaotic days that followed the invasion, he, like many citizens, had rushed to volunteer to defend the nation and was initially assigned to a special demolitions detachment of the People&#x2019;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD, the dreaded secret police agency that would later become the KGB. The NKVD created 2,222 of these detachments to harass the Nazis behind the front, which was then rapidly advanc�ing. One of Putin&#x2019;s first missions in the war was a disaster. He and twenty-seven other partisan fighters parachuted behind the Germans advancing on Leningrad, near the town of Kingisepp. It was close to the border with Estonia, which the Soviet Union had occupied the year before, along with Latvia and Lithuania, as part of the notorious pre�war pact with Hitler. Putin&#x2019;s detachment managed to blow up one arms depot, as the story went, but quickly ran out of ammunition and rations. Local residents, Estonians, brought them food but also betrayed them to the Germans, whom many in the Baltic nations welcomed, at least at first, as liberators from Soviet occupation. German troops closed in on the unit, firing on them as they raced along a road back to the Soviet lines. Putin split off, chased by Germans with dogs, and hid in a marsh, submerging himself and breathing through a reed until the patrol moved on.8 How exactly he made it back is lost to the fog of history, but only he and three others of the detachment survived the raid. The NKVD interrogated him after his escape, but he managed to avoid suspicion of desertion or cowardice and was soon sent back to the front. It might have been courage alone that drove Putin, or it might have been fear. Stalin&#x2019;s Order No. 270, issued on August 16, had threatened soldiers who deserted with execution and their family members with arrest.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside Leningrad conditions deteriorated rapidly, despite efforts by the authorities to maintain a sense of normality. Schools opened, as always, on September 1, but three days later the first German shells landed inside the city. With the blockade completed and the city now under regu�lar assault from above, the authorities intensified the rationing of food. <br> &nbsp;<br> Rations would gradually decline, leading to desperation, despair, and finally death. As Vladimir Putin fought outside the city, his wife, Maria, and their infant son were trapped inside. Vladimir and Maria, both born in 1911, were children of Russia&#x2019;s turbulent twentieth century, buffeted by World War I, the Bolshevik revolution, and the civil war that followed. They met in Pominovo, where his father had moved after the revolution, and married in 1928, when they were only sev�enteen. They moved back to Leningrad as newlyweds, settling back in Petrodvorets with her relatives in 1932. After Putin&#x2019;s conscription in the navy, they had a boy named Oleg, who died in infancy. A year before the war started, they had a second son, Viktor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maria and Viktor only narrowly avoided occupation in Nazi-held ter�ritories. She had refused at first to leave Petrodvorets, but as the Germans closed in, her brother, Ivan Shelomov, forced her to evacuate. He served as a first captain in the Baltic Fleet&#x2019;s headquarters and thus had military authority and what privileges still existed in a city under siege. Captain Shelomov retrieved them &#x201c;under gunfire and bombs&#x201d; and settled them into a city whose fate was precarious. Conditions became dire as the winter arrived, the cold that year even more bitter than usual. Maria and Viktor moved into one of dozens of shelters the authorities opened to house refugees pouring in from the occupied outskirts. Her brother helped her with his own rations, but her health faded nevertheless. One day&#x2014;exactly when is unknown&#x2014;she passed out and passersby laid her body out with the frozen corpses that had begun to pile up on the street for collection, left for dead, as her husband had been on the front. She was discovered, somehow, in this open-air morgue, her moans attracting attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vladimir&#x2019;s survival seemed no less improbable. He lay wounded beside the Neva for several hours before other Soviet troops found him and carried him back toward the regiment&#x2019;s redoubt on the bank. He might have died, one of more than 300,000 soldiers who lost their lives on the Pyatachok, except that an old neighbor found him on a litter at a primitive field hospital. He slung Putin over his shoulder and carried him across the frozen river to a hospital on the other side.<br> &nbsp;<br> As it turned out, Putin&#x2019;s injury almost certainly saved his life. His unit, the 330th Rifle Regiment, fought on the bridgehead throughout the winter of 1941&#x2013;1942. The battle, in scale and carnage, foreshadowed the terrible siege of Stalingrad the next year, a &#x201c;monstrous meatgrinder,&#x201d;&nbsp;it was called. The forces there endured relentless shelling by the Ger�mans. The forested riverbank became a churned, lifeless landscape where nothing would grow for years. New recruits crossed the Neva to replace those killed or wounded at a staggering rate of hundreds a day until the spring of 1942, when the bridgehead collapsed and the Germans regained the ground on April 27. The 330th Rifle Regiment was entirely destroyed except for a major from its command staff, Aleksandr Sokolov, who managed to swim to safety, despite serious wounds.15 It was one of the deadliest single battles of the entire war, and for the Soviet mili�tary command, a folly that squandered tens of thousands of soldiers and probably prolonged the siege instead of shortening it.<br><br>Putin spent months in a military hospital, recovering in a city that was dying around him. By the time the last road out of the city was cut, three million civilians and soldiers remained besieged. Maria, who refused to be evacuated when it was still possible, ultimately found her husband in the hospital. Against the rules, he shared his own hospital rations with her, hiding food from the nurses until a doctor noticed and halted Maria&#x2019;s daily visits for a time. The city&#x2019;s initial resilience succumbed to devastation, starvation, and worse. Essential services deteriorated along with the food supply. Corpses lay uncollected in mounds on the streets. In January and February 1942, more than 100,000 people died each month. The only connection to unoccupied territory was the make�shift &#x201c;Road of Life,&#x201d; a series of precarious routes over the frozen waters of Lake Ladoga. They provided minimal relief to the city, and the siege ground on until January 1943, when the Soviet army broke through the encirclement to the east. It took another year to fully free the city from the Nazi grip and begin the relentless, ruthless Soviet march to Berlin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vladimir and Maria somehow survived, though his injuries caused him to limp in pain for the rest of his life. In April 1942, he was released from the hospital and sent to work at a weapons factory that turned out artillery shells and antitank mines. Their son, Viktor, did not survive. He died of diphtheria in June 1942 and was buried in a mass grave at Piskaryovskoye Cemetery along with 470,000 other civilians and sol�diers. Neither Vladimir nor Maria knew where exactly and evidently made little effort to learn. Nor did they ever talk about it in detail later. The war&#x2019;s toll was devastatingly personal. Maria&#x2019;s mother, Elizabeta Shelomova, died on the front lines west of Moscow in October 1941, though it was never clear whether it was a Soviet or a German shell that killed her; Maria&#x2019;s brother Ivan survived, but another brother, Pyotr, was&nbsp;condemned by a military tribunal at the front in the earliest days of the war, evidently for some dereliction of duty, and his ultimate fate was never known, and certainly not mentioned. Two of Vladimir&#x2019;s brothers also died during the war: Mikhail in July 1942, also in circumstances lost to history; and Aleksei on the Voronezh front in February 1943.<br><br>These were the stories of the Great Patriotic War&#x2014;tales of heroism and suffering&#x2014;that Vladimir and Maria&#x2019;s third son would grow up hear�ing and that would leave an indelible impression on him throughout his life. From &#x201c;some snatches, some fragments&#x201d; of conversations overheard at the kitchen table in a crowded communal flat in a still-devastated Len�ingrad, he created his family narrative, one reshaped by time and mem�ory, one that might have been apocryphal in places and was certainly far from complete. The Putins were simple people, unlikely to know much of the darker aspects of the war: Stalin&#x2019;s paranoid purges in the Great Terror that had decimated the army before the war; the connivance with Hitler&#x2019;s plans to conquer Europe; the partitioning of Poland in 1939; the forceful annexation of the Baltic nations; the chaotic defense once the Nazis invaded; the official malfeasance that contributed to the starvation in Leningrad; the vengeful atrocities committed by Soviet troops as they marched to Berlin. Even then, after Stalin&#x2019;s death in 1953, it remained dangerous to speak poorly of the state in anything above a whisper. The victory&#x2014;and the Putins&#x2019; small part in it&#x2014;was an inexhaustible fountain of pride. What else could it be? One did not think of the mistakes that were made, the young boy would say later; one thought only of winning.</p><h2>The Deadly Curse of Toco-Rey (The Cooper Kids Adventure Series #6)</h2><p><p>Lila and Jay Cooper have joined their dad on a mission to the jungles of Central America, where a group of American treasure hunters have already become the victims of the deadly curse of Toco-Rey.

A literary biography of 19th-century French novelist, radical, and intellectual impresario Gustave Flaubert? A meditation on the uses and misuses of language? A novel of obsession, denial, irritation, and underhanded connivery? A thriller complete with disguises, sleuthing, mysterious meetings, and unknowing targets? An extended essay on the nature of fiction itself?<p> On the surface, at first, Julian Barnes's book is the tale of an elderly English doctor's search for some intriguing details of Flaubert's life. Geoffrey Braithwaite seems to be involved in an attempt to establish whether a particularly fine, lovely, and ancient stuffed parrot is in fact one originally "borrowed by G. Flaubert from the Museum of Rouen and placed on his worktable during the writing of <i>Un coeur simple</i>, where it is called Loulou, the parrot of Felicit�, the principal character of the tale."</p><p> What begins as a droll and intriguing excursion into the minutiae of Flaubert's life and intellect, along with an attempt to solve the small puzzle of the parrot--or rather parrots, for there are two competing for the title of Gustave's avian confrere--soon devolves into something obscure and worrisome, the exploration of an arcane Braithwaite obsession that is perhaps even pathological. The first hint we have that all is not as it seems comes almost halfway into the book, when after a humorously cantankerous account of the inadequacies of literary critics, Braithwaite closes a chapter by saying, "Now do you understand why I hate critics? I could try and describe to you the expression in my eyes at this moment; but they are far too discoloured with rage." And from that point, things just get more and more curious, until they end in the most unexpected bang.</p><p> One passage perhaps best describes the overall effect of this extraordinary story: "You can define a net in one of two ways, depending on your point of view. Normally, you would say that it is a meshed instrument designed to catch fish. But you could, with no great injury to logic, reverse the image and define the net as a jocular lexicographer once did: he called it a collection of holes tied together with string." Julian Barnes demonstrates that it is possible to catch quite an interesting fish no matter how you define the net. <i>--Andrew Himes</i></p>Born in Leicester in 1946, Julian Barnes is the author of nine novels, a book of stories, and a collection of essays.

I met Meg through work&#x2014;a place where you are traditionally quiet about being in the kind of relationship in which you and your partner could be dating another couple. But after I left my job, Meg and I stayed friends on Facebook, and Facebook is a considerably less private sphere. On social media, I&#x2019;m out as being polyamorous&#x2014;that is to say, I practice ethical, consensual nonmonogamy. Meg messaged me one night to tell me that she was poly, too. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be friends, possibly?&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;Or feel free to ignore this message; I promise not to find it rude if you choose to.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg had been my superior at work, and from the moment I met her I had a big, fat, unprofessional crush on her. She wrote scathing, intelligent news analyses (superhot when you&#x2019;re a writer), and she had a dexterity to her walk; later I would find out she was into circus arts and acroyoga. So, months later, after I&#x2019;d left the job and figured I would probably never see Meg again, I was dizzy to get a message from her. I responded that, uh, yes, we should totally be friends, I mean, ha ha, I&#x2019;m not weirdly eager or anything; I&#x2019;m, like, superbusy, but if she wanted to, you know, I would like to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever. Somehow, through the grace of the universe, this rambling spurt of a reply didn&#x2019;t drive Meg away, and a few weeks later, she came over for dinner.<br> <br>At dinner, I tried to act cool and look Meg in the eye a few times, but it was difficult, because she was even more beautiful and interesting than I had remembered her being. Luckily, my boyfriend, Luke, was also there, and he quelled the tension. He&#x2019;s a pro at asking good questions (&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the weirdest thing you&#x2019;ve ever done for love?&#x201d;)&#x2014;it&#x2019;s one of the things I loved the most about him when we met. Regardless of the presence of a third person, though, I still felt like I was on a date with Meg. Luke knew I had a crush on her; if she didn&#x2019;t know I had a crush on her, then she was (mercifully) ignoring a few pretty obvious signs. I think the vibe was felt around the table.<br> <br> <br> <br>We went to the sex party, which was amazing. I&#x2019;m sure you have a lot of questions about the sex party (such as, &#x201c;What is a sex party, exactly?&#x201d;), and I promise that, eventually, I will answer them. But this part of the book is about my cat, who left the world before his time, and the people who were there to care for us in his wake.<br> <br>At the sex party, we met Tony, who is one of Meg&#x2019;s partners (the one she lives with). We also, technically, met Meg&#x2019;s other partner and a host of people Meg dates or has dated or plays with from time to time. But Luke and I both felt drawn to Tony, who was refreshingly forthcoming. A week later, Meg asked if Luke and I wanted to go on a date with her and Tony, and we both thought that sounded great.<br> <br>If I had been nervous about my friendly initial dinner with dreamy Meg, I was a wreck about going on an actual date with her and her partner. It was especially terrifying to embark on dating another couple as a couple&#x2014;territory neither Luke nor I had any practice with or guidelines for. At the end of the date, if I wanted to kiss Meg or Tony or both of them, did I ask? Did we all have to kiss the first kiss together, in a kind of Spring Break&#x2013;style quadrilateral?<br> <br>The date was really like any other date: We ate dinner and learned about one another. We asked questions about childhood; we told stories about past loves. There was kissing at the end, and while I&#x2019;d love to get into that right now in detail, I&#x2019;m telling you about this date right here and now only because I want you to know, at least marginally, the nature of our relationship with Meg and Tony before I tell you about the night Jean passed away.<br> <br>Everything was nearly ready for our date that night: the sushi rice had been cooked and was cooling, and the seaweed was artfully arranged on a red plate. I&#x2019;d even tempered some chocolate and was dipping butter cookies in it for dessert. When Jean&#x2019;s legs collapsed, I called the vet, hoping he would say something like, &#x201c;Oh, yeah, cats&#x2019; legs collapse all the time. That&#x2019;s normal. Give him three sips of water and he should be good as new.&#x201d; But instead, he said that we needed to take him to the emergency room immediately. So Luke got the cat carrier, and I called Meg.<br> <br> <br> <br>I should pause to say that while people who have cats are generally a little crazy about them, I am high on the spectrum of this feline-related lunacy. I buy food for my cats that costs significantly more than the food I buy for myself. When I go out of town, I call the cat sitter and ask to speak to my cats on the phone. Jean was one of a pair; Puppy, the other cat, seemed deeply troubled by Jean&#x2019;s sudden collapse, and that felt like another major crisis that had to be dealt with.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come over,&#x201d; I told Meg distantly. &#x201c;Call Tony and tell him what happened, and when you get here, we&#x2019;ll sort it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told Luke to take Jean to the vet and to call me when he got there, and we would go from there.<br> <br>When she came into the apartment, Meg didn&#x2019;t even take off her coat before she held me tightly in her arms. &#x201c;What do you need,&#x201d; she said, making it a statement, not a question; like she was going to do whatever it took to make this situation better and easier. I didn&#x2019;t have words. I just let her hold my hands.<br> <br>Tony arrived just as Luke called from the vet. I shut myself in the bedroom and took in the bad news: it was a heart condition, and it was serious, and they didn&#x2019;t know if Jean would make it.<br> <br>When I left the bedroom to tell Meg and Tony, I couldn&#x2019;t get the words out.<br> <br> <br> <br>The second time I said it, Meg seemed to grasp the subtext: I needed them to stay. I needed someone to be with Puppy; I needed someone to hold us to the ground.<br> <br>Tony and Meg made the sushi. When we had to pay an ungodly amount of money for the procedures Jean required, I called Meg and had her find my emergency credit card and read the number to me over the phone. When we got home, exhausted, defeated, and in total despair, they were still there. They stayed. They cleaned. When they finally left, holding us both a little longer than normal during their good-byes, I thought to myself, &#x201c;This is what love is.&#x201d;</p><h2>Kettle Bottom</h2><p>Winner of the 2004 Perugia Press Prize, as well as the 2008 Thomas and Lillie D.

As a result, each of these institutions faces a grave and growing crisis, fueling our near-pathological pursuit of technological fixes even as we push our planet to the brink of collapse.<br><br>Fortunately, an Age of Reunion is emerging out of the birth pangs of an earth in crisis. As our old constructs of self and world dissolve in crisis, we are entering a new narrative of interbeing, a more expansive sense of self, and a more ecological relationship to nature. Our darkest hour bears the possibility of a more beautiful world&#x2014;not through the extension of millennia-old methods of management and control but by fundamentally reimagining ourselves and our systems.&nbsp; Breathtaking in its scope and intelligence, <i>The Ascent of Humanity</i> is a remarkable book showing what it truly means to be human.</p><p>Charles Eisenstein&nbsp;is a teacher, speaker, and writer focusing on themes of civilization, consciousness, money, and human cultural evolution. His writings on the web magazine Reality Sandwich have generated a vast online following; he speaks frequently at conferences and other events, and gives numerous interviews on radio and podcasts. Eisenstein graduated from Yale University in 1989 with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, and spent the next ten years as a Chinese-English translator.

The first of these gifts we call technology; the other we call culture. They are central to our humanity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Accumulating over thousands of years, culture and technology have brought us into a separate human realm. We live, more than any animal, surrounded by our own artifacts. Among these are works of surpassing beauty, complexity, and power, human creations that could not have existed&#x2014;could not even have been conceived&#x2014;in the times of our forebears. Seldom do we pause to appreciate the audacity of our achievements: objects as mundane as a compact disc, a video cell phone, an airplane would have seemed fantastical only a few centuries ago. We have created a realm of magic and miracles. <br>&nbsp;<br>At the same time, it is quite easy to see technology and culture not as a gift but as a curse. After millennia of development, the power to manipulate the environment has become the power to destroy it, while the ability to transmit knowledge transmits as well a legacy of hatred, injustice, and violence. Today, as both the destruction and the violence reach a feverish crescendo, few can deny that the world is in a state of crisis. Opinions vary as to its exact nature: some people say it is primarily ecological; others say it is a moral crisis, a social, economic, or political crisis, a health crisis, even a spiritual crisis. There is, however, little disagreement that the crisis is of human origin. Hence, despair: Is the present ruination of the world built in to our humanity?<br>&nbsp;<br>Are genocide and ecocide the inevitable price of civilization&#x2019;s magnificence?<br>Need the most sublime achievements of art, music, literature, science, and technology be built upon the wreckage of the natural world and the misery of its inhabitants? Can the microchip come without the oil slick, the strip mine, the toxic waste dump? Under the shadow of every Chartres Cathedral, must there be women burning at the stake? In other words, can the gift of technology and culture somehow be separated from the curse?<br>&nbsp;<br>The dashed Utopian dreams of the last few centuries leave little hope. Despite the miracles we have produced, people across the ideological spectrum, from Christian fundamentalists to environmental activists, share a foreboding that the world is in grave and growing peril. Temporary, localized improvements cannot hide the ambient wrongness that pervades the warp and woof of modern society, and often our personal lives as well. We might manage each immediate problem and control every foreseeable risk, but an underlying disquiet remains. I am referring simply to the feeling, &#x201c;Something is wrong around here.&#x201d; Something so fundamentally wrong that centuries of our best and brightest efforts to create a better world have failed or even backfired. As this realization sinks in, we respond with despair, cynicism, numbness, or detachment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet no matter how complete the despair, no matter how bitter the cynicism, a possibility beckons of a world more beautiful and a life more magnificent than what we know today. Though we may rationalize it, it is not rational. We become aware of it in moments, gaps in the rush and press of modern life. These moments come to us alone in nature, or with a baby, making love, playing with children, caring for a dying person, making music for the sake of music or beauty for the sake of beauty. At such times, a simple and easy joy shows us the futility of the vast, life-consuming program of management and control.<br>&nbsp;<br>We intuit that something similar is possible collectively. Some of us may have experienced it when we find ourselves cooperating naturally and effortlessly, instruments of a purpose greater than ourselves that, paradoxically, makes us individually more and not less when we abandon ourselves to it. It is what musicians are referring to when they say, &#x201c;The music played the band.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Another way of being is possible, and it is right in front of us, closer than close. That much is transparently certain. Yet it slips away so easily that we hardly believe it could be the foundation of life; so we relegate it to an afterlife and call it Heaven, or we relegate it to the future and call it Utopia. (When nanotechnology solves all our problems ... when we all learn to be nice to each other ... when finally I&#x2019;m not so busy ...) Either way, we set it apart from this world and this life, and thereby deny its practicality and its reality in the here and now. Yet the knowledge that life is more than Just This cannot be suppressed, not forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>I share with dreamers, Utopians, and teenagers an unreasonable intuition of a magnificent potential, that life and the world can be more than we have made of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>What error, then, what delusion has led us to accept the lesser lives and the lesser world we find ourselves in today? What has rendered us helpless to resist the ugliness, pollution, injustice, and downright horror that have risen to engulf the planet in the last few centuries? What calamity has so resigned us to it, that we call this the human condition? Those moments of love, freedom, serenity, play&#x2014;what power has made us believe these are but respites from real life?<br>&nbsp;<br>Inspired by such moments, I have spent the last ten years trying to understand what keeps us&#x2014;and what keeps me&#x2014;from the better world that our hearts tell us must exist. To my endless amazement, I keep discovering a common root underneath all the diverse crises of the modern age. Underlying the vast swath of ruin our civilization has carved is not human nature, but the opposite: human nature denied. This denial of human nature rests in turn upon an illusion, a misconception of self and world. We have defined ourselves as other than what we are, as discrete subjects separate from each other and separate from the world around us. In a way this is good news. In this book I will describe the profound changes that will flow, and are already flowing, from the reconception of the self that is under way. The bad news is that our present conception of self is so deeply woven into our civilization&#x2014;into our technology and culture&#x2014;that its abandonment can come only with the collapse of much that is familiar. This is what the present convergence of crises portends.<br>&nbsp;<br>Everything I wrote in the preceding paragraph about our civilization also applies to each of us individually. Saints and mystics have tried for thousands of years to teach us how we are trapped in a delusion about who we are. This delusion inevitably brings about suffering, and eventually a crisis that can be resolved only through a collapse, a surrender, and an opening to a state of being beyond previous self-limitation. You are not, they tell us, a &#x201c;skin-encapsulated ego,&#x201d; and lasting happiness can never result from pursuing that ego&#x2019;s agenda. These spiritual teachings have helped me realize, at least partway, my intuitions of what work, love, human relationship, and health can be. They are not the main subject of this book, however, nor do I claim to exemplify them in my own life. Nonetheless, the shift in our collective self-conception is intimately related to a parallel shift in our individual self-conception. In other words, there is a spiritual dimension to the planetary crisis.<br>&nbsp;<br>As this planetary crisis invades our individual lives, unavoidably, neither the personal nor the collective misconception of who we are will remain tenable. Each mirrors the other: in its origin, its consequences, and its resolution. That is why this book interweaves the story of humanity&#x2019;s separation from nature with the story of our individual alienation from life, nature, spirit, and self.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite my faith that life is meant to be more, little voices whisper in my ear that I am crazy. Nothing is amiss, they say, this is just the way things are. The rising tide of human misery and ecological destruction, as old as civilization, is simply the human condition, an inevitable result of built-in human flaws like selfishness and laziness. Since you can&#x2019;t change it, be thankful for your good fortune in avoiding it. The misery of much of the planet is a warning, say the voices, to protect me and mine, impelling me to maximize my security.<br>&nbsp;<br>Besides, it couldn&#x2019;t be as bad as I think. If all that stuff were true&#x2014;about the ecological destruction, the genocide, the starving children, and the whole litany of impending crises&#x2014;then wouldn&#x2019;t everyone be in an uproar about it? The normalcy of the routines surrounding me here in America tells me, &#x201c;It couldn&#x2019;t be that bad.&#x201d; That little voice echoes throughout the culture. Every advertising flyer, every celebrity news item, every product catalog, every hyped-up sports event, carries the subtext, &#x201c;You can afford to care about this.&#x201d; A man in a burning house wouldn&#x2019;t care about these things; that our culture does care about them, almost exclusively, implies that our house is not burning down. The forests are not dying. The deserts are not spreading. The atmosphere is not heating. Children are not starving. Torturers are not going free. Whole ethnicities are not being exterminated. These crimes against humanity and crimes against nature couldn&#x2019;t really be happening. Probably they have been exaggerated; in any event, they are happening somewhere else. Our society will figure out solutions before the calamities of the Third World affect me. See, no one else is worried, are they? Life hums on as usual.<br>&nbsp;<br>As for my intuition of magnificent possibilities for my own life, well, my expectations are too high. Grow up, the voices say, life is just like this. What right have I to expect the unreasonable magnificence whose possibility certain moments have shown me? No, it is my intuitions that are not to be trusted. The examples of what life is surround me and define what is normal. Do I see anyone around me whose work is their joy, whose time is their own, whose love is their passion? It can&#x2019;t happen. Be thankful, say the voices, that my job is reasonably stimulating, that I feel &#x201c;in love&#x201d; at least once in a while, that the pain is manageable and life&#x2019;s uncertainties under control. Let good enough be good enough. Sure, life can be a drag, but at least I can afford to escape it sometimes. Life is about work, self-discipline, responsibility, but if I get these out of the way quickly and efficiently, I can enjoy vacations, entertainment, weekends, maybe even early retirement. Listening to these voices, is it any wonder that for many years, I devoted most of my energy and vitality to the escapes from life? Is it any wonder that so many of my students at Penn State look forward already, at age twenty-one, to retirement?<br>&nbsp;<br>If life and the world are Just This, we are left no choice but to make the best of it: to be more efficient, to achieve better security, to get life&#x2019;s uncertainties under control. There are voices that speak to this too. They are the evangelists of technology and self-improvement, who urge us to improve the human condition basically by trying harder. My inner evangelist tells me to get my life under control, to work out every day, to organize my time more efficiently, to watch my diet, to be more disciplined, to try harder to be a good person. On the collective level, the same attitude says that perhaps the next generation of material and social technologies&#x2014;new medicines, better laws, faster computers, solar power, nanotechnology&#x2014;will finally succeed in improving our lot. We will be more efficient, more intelligent, more capable, and finally have the capacity to solve humanity&#x2019;s age-old problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>For more and more people today, these voices ring hollow. Words like &#x201c;high-tech&#x201d; and &#x201c;modern&#x201d; lose their cachet as a multiplicity of crises converge upon our planet. If we are fortunate, we might, for a time, prevent these crises from invading our personal lives. Yet as the environment continues to deteriorate, as job security evaporates, as the international situation worsens, as new incurable diseases appear, as the pace of change accelerates, it seems impossible to rest at ease. The world grows more competitive, more dangerous, less hospitable to easy living, and security comes with greater and greater effort. And even when temporary security is won, a latent anxiety lurks within the fortress walls, a mute unease in the background of modern life. It pervades technological society, and only intensifies as the pace of technology quickens. We begin to grow hopeless as our solutions&#x2014;new technologies, new laws, more education, trying harder&#x2014;only seem to worsen our problems. For many activists, hopelessness gives way to despair as catastrophe looms ever closer despite their best efforts.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book explains why trying harder can never work. Our &#x201c;best efforts&#x201d; are grounded in the same mode of being that is responsible for the crisis in the first place. As Audre Lorde put it, &#x201c;The master&#x2019;s tools will never dismantle the master&#x2019;s house.&#x201d; Soon, though, this mode of being will come to an end, to be replaced by a profoundly different sense of the self, and a profoundly different relationship between human and nature. This book is about the gathering revolution in human beingness.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we say that the planetary crisis is of human (and not natural) origin, what do we mean? Human beings are mammals, after all, biological creatures no less natural than any other. In a sense, there can be no distinction between human and nature, because human beings are a part of nature and everything we do is therefore &#x201c;natural.&#x201d; However, we <i>do </i>distinguish. We recognize in nature a kind of harmony, balance, authenticity, and beauty lacking in the world of technology&#x2014;think of the connotations of the word &#x201c;artificial.&#x201d; Whether in fact or in perception, we modern humans live in a way that is no longer natural.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the crux of the human/nature distinction is technology, the product of the human hand. While other animals do make and use tools, no other species has our capacity to remake or destroy the physical environment, to control nature&#x2019;s processes or transcend nature&#x2019;s limitations. In the mental and spiritual realm, the counterpart of technology is culture, which modifies and even supersedes human nature in the same way technology modifies physical nature. In thus mastering nature with technology, and mastering human nature with culture, we distinguish ourselves from the rest of life, establishing a separate human realm. Believing this to be a good thing, we think of this separation as an ascent in which we have risen above our animal origins. That is why we naturally refer to the millennia-long accumulation of culture and technology as &#x201c;progress.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is separation, then, in the form of technology and culture, that defines us as human. As well, it is separation that has generated the converging crises of today&#x2019;s world. People of a religious persuasion might attribute the fundamental crisis to a separation from God; people of an ecological persua...</p><h2>American Negro Slave Revolts</h2><p>This is the first fully documented study of Negro slave revolts in The United States.

Leading a team of experts on a meticulous, heartbreaking dig, Tempe Brennan pieces together the violence of the past. But a fresh wave of terror begins when the horrific sounds of a fatal attack on two colleagues come in on a blood-chilling satellite call. Teaming up with Special Crimes Investigator Bartolom� Galiano and Montreal detective Andrew Ryan, Tempe quickly becomes enmeshed in the cases of four privileged young women who have vanished from Guatemala City -- and finds herself caught in deadly territory where power, money, greed, and science converge.</p><p>Temperance Brennan is helping her Guatemalan colleagues identify the remains of villagers who were "disappeared" 20 years ago when she's called in to consult on four more recent disappearances. Is there a serial killer loose in Guatemala City, or is the fate of the young women who've gone missing--including the daughter of the Canadian ambassador--connected to the murder of a human-rights investigator looking into the decades-old massacre? Brennan, the protagonist of Reichs's popular series, is literally hip-deep in intrigue, between the well in Chupan Ya where she unearths the bones of women and children slain in Guatemala's bloody civil war and the septic tank in the capital where the remains of one of the missing girls turn up. Tempe is a standout in crime fiction's crowded field of forensics experts--she's one of its more complex and interesting protagonists, dealing with intriguing cases that often cross national borders and a personal life that's rich in possibilities the author skillfully exploits.

Thousands of men disappeared and their eagle standard was lost. It's a mystery that's never been solved, until now . . .<br> Marcus has to find out what happened to his father, who led the legion.

Born in Surrey, Sutcliff spent her childhood in Malta and on various other naval bases where her father was stationed. At a young age, she contracted Still's Disease, which confined her to a wheelchair for most of her life. Shortly before her death, she was named Commander of the British Empire (CBE) one of Britain's most prestigious honors. She died in West Sussex, England, in 1992.</p>I&nbsp;Frontier Fort <p>From the Fosseway westward to Isca Dumnoniorum the road was simply a British trackway, broadened and roughly metalled, strengthened by corduroys of logs in the softest places, but otherwise unchanged from its old estate, as it wound among the hills, thrusting farther and farther into the wilderness.</p><p>It was a busy road and saw many travellers: traders with bronze weapons and raw yellow amber in their ponies&#x2019; packs; country folk driving shaggy cattle or lean pigs from village to village; sometimes a band of tawny-haired tribesmen from farther west; strolling harpers and quack-oculists too, or a light-stepping hunter with huge wolf-hounds at his heel; and from time to time a commissariat wagon going up and down to supply the Roman frontier post. The road saw them all, and the cohorts of the Eagles for whom all other travellers must make way.</p><p>There was a cohort of leather-clad auxiliaries on the road today, swinging along at the steady Legion&#x2019;s pace that had brought them down from Isca Silurium at twenty miles a day; the new garrison coming to relieve the old one at Isca Dumnoniorum. On they went, following the road that now ran out on a causeway between sodden marsh and empty sky, now plunged into deep boar-hunted forest, or lifted over bleak uplands where nothing grew save furze and thorn-scrub. On with never a halt nor a change of rhythm, marching Century by Century, the sun bright on the Standard at their head, and the rolling dust-cloud kicked up over the pack-train behind.</p><p>At the head of the column marched the Pilus Prior Centurion, the Cohort Commander, the pride that shone from him showing clearly that this was his first command. They were, he had long since decided, a command worthy of anyone&#x2019;s pride; six hundred yellow-haired giants recruited from the tribes of Upper Gaul, with the natural fighting power of mountain cats, drilled and hammered into what he firmly believed to be the finest Auxiliary Cohort ever to serve with the Second Legion. They were a newly joined Cohort; many of the men had not yet proved themselves in action, and the spear-shaft of their Standard had no honours on it, no gilded laurel wreath nor victor&#x2019;s crown. The honours were all to win&#x2014;perhaps during his command.</p><p>The Commander was a complete contrast to his men: Roman to his arrogant fingertips, wiry and dark as they were raw-boned and fair. The olive-skinned face under the curve of his crested helmet had not a soft line in it anywhere&#x2014;a harsh face it would have been, but that it was winged with laughter lines, and between his level black brows showed a small raised scar that marked him for one who had passed the Raven Degree of Mithras.</p><p>Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila had seen little of the Eagles until a year ago. His first ten years had been lived quietly with his mother on the family farm near Clusium, while his father soldiered in Judaea, in Egypt, and here in Britain. They had been going to join his father in Britain, but before the time came for them to do so, rebellion had flared up among the northern tribes, and the Ninth Hispana, his father&#x2019;s Legion, had marched north to deal with it, and never came marching back.</p><p>His mother had died soon afterward, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband. Marcus had loathed the official, and the official had loathed Marcus. They saw everything with different eyes. Marcus came of a line of soldiers&#x2014;one of those Equestrian families who, when the rest of their kind had turned from soldiering to trade and finance, had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence. The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus&#x2019;s. Neither of them had a shred of understanding for each other&#x2019;s ideas, and they had both been thankful when Marcus was eighteen and could apply for a centurion&#x2019;s commission.</p><p>Marcus, his eyes narrowed into the sun as he marched, smiled to himself a little wryly, as he remembered how almost pathetically thankful that plump official had been. (Tramp, tramp, tramp, said the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>He had asked to be sent to Britain, though it meant starting in an auxiliary cohort instead of a line-of-battle one, partly because his father&#x2019;s elder brother had settled there when his own years of soldiering were done, but mostly because of his father. If ever anything became known of the lost Legion, it would be known first in Britain, and it might even be that here in Britain he would find out something for himself.</p><p>Marching down the Isca Dumnoniorum road in the run-honey evening light, he found himself thinking about his father. He had very vivid memories of a slight, dark man with laughter lines at the corners of his eyes, who had come home from time to time, and taught him to fish, to play &#x201c;Flash the Fingers,&#x201d; and throw a javelin. He remembered vividly that last leave of all. His father had just been appointed to command the First Cohort of the Hispana, which meant having charge of the Eagle and being something very like second-in-command of the Legion besides; and he had been like a jubilant boy about it. But his mother had been faintly anxious, almost as if she knew...</p><p>&#x201c;If it was any other Legion!&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;You have told me yourself that the Hispana has a bad name.&#x201d;</p><p>And his father had replied: &#x201c;But I would not have it any other Legion if I could. I held my first command in the Hispana, and a man&#x2019;s first Legion is apt to hold chief place in his heart ever after, be its name good or bad; and now that I go back to it as First Cohort, we will see whether there is nothing can be done to better its name.&#x201d; He had turned to his small son, laughing. &#x201c;Presently it will be your turn. It has fallen on evil days, but we will make a Legion of the Hispana yet, you and I.&#x201d;</p><p>Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father&#x2019;s eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.</p><p>(Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the sound of the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>It would be pleasant, he thought, if Uncle Aquila was like his father. He had not met his uncle yet; after learning his foot-drill he had arrived in Britain in the sleety days of late autumn, and been sent straight up to Isca; but he had a rather vague invitation to spend his leave with him at Calleva, when he had any leave to spend. It would be very pleasant if Uncle Aquila was like his father.</p><p>Not of course that he and his uncle were likely to have much to do with each other. In a few years&#x2019; time he would probably be serving in quite a different part of the Empire, since a Cohort Centurion seldom moved up all the way in the same Legion.</p><p>All the way...from his present rank right up to his father&#x2019;s rank of First Cohort; and after that? For most of the men who got so far there was nothing after that, but for the outstanding few who went further&#x2014;as Marcus intended to go further&#x2014;the ways divided there. One could become a Camp Commandant, as Uncle Aquila had done, or one could go on, by way of the Praetorian Guard, to try for command of a Legion. Legion Commanders were almost always men of Senator&#x2019;s rank, with no experience of soldiering save a year&#x2019;s service as Military Tribune in their youth; but by long custom the two Egyptian Legions were exceptions to the rule. They were commanded by professional soldiers; and an Egyptian Legion had been Marcus&#x2019;s shining goal for as long as he could remember.</p><p>But one day, when he had finished with the Eagles, when he had made an honourable name and become Prefect of his Egyptian Legion, he would go home to the Etruscan hills, and perhaps even buy back the old farm, which the plump official had ruthlessly sold to defray expenses. For a moment he remembered almost painfully the sunlit courtyard flickered over with the shadow of pigeons&#x2019; wings, and the wild olive tree in the loop of the stream, on a twisted root of which he had once found a kind of gall growing, that was shaped something like a little bird. He had cut it from the root with the new knife his father had given him, and spent much loving care, all one absorbed summer evening, trimming and carving feathers on it. He had that little bird still.</p><p>The road topped a gentle rise, and suddenly Isca Dumnoniorum lay before them, with the fortress-crowned Red Mount dark with shadows against the evening sky; and Marcus came back to the present with a jerk. The farm in the Etruscan hills could wait until he was old and tired and famous; in the present was the glory of his first command.</p><p>The British town was spread below the southern scarp of the Mount; a sprawling huddle of reed-thatched roofs, every colour from the gold of honey to the black of dried peat, according to the age of the thatch; with the squared, clean lines of the Roman forum and basilica looking oddly rootless in their midst; and the faint haze of woodsmoke lying over all.</p><p>The road led straight through the town and up to the cleared slope beyond, to the Praetorian gate of the fort; here and there, crimson-or saffron-cloaked men turned to look at the cohort as it swung by, a look that was reserved rather than hostile. Dogs sat scratching in odd corners, lean pigs rooted among the garbage piles, and women with bracelets of gold or copper on very white arms sat in hut doorways, spinning, or grinding corn. The blue smoke of many cooking-fires curled up into the quiet air, and the savoury smell of many evening meals mingled with the blue reek of woodsmoke and the sharper tang of horse-droppings, which Marcus had by now come to associate with all British towns. Little that was Roman was here as yet, despite the stone-built forum. One day there would be straight streets, he supposed, and temples and bathhouses and a Roman way of life. But as yet it was a place where two worlds met without mingling: a British town huddled under the dominion of the turf ramparts where once the tribe had had its stronghold and now the Roman sentries paced up and down. He looked about him under the curve of his helmet as he marched, knowing that this place would be part of his life for the next year; then looked up to the turf ramparts, and saw a Roman banner drooping in the still air and the tall crest of a sentry burning in the sunset, and heard a trumpet-call ring out, as it seemed, from the fiery sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You have brought clear skies with you,&#x201d; said Centurion Quintus Hilarion, lounging in the window of the Commander&#x2019;s quarters, and peering into the night. &#x201c;But Hercle! you need not expect it to last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As bad as that?&#x201d; said Centurion Marcus Aquila, who was seated on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Quite as bad as that! It rains always, here in the west, save when Typhon, the father of all ills, brews up a mist to come between a man and his own feet. By the time you have served your year here you will have toadstools sprouting out of your ears, the same as me, and not from the damp alone!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From what besides?&#x201d; enquired Marcus with interest. &#x201c;Oh, lack of company, for one thing. I am a sociable soul myself; I like my friends around me.&#x201d; He turned from the window, and folded up on to a low cushioned bench, hugging his knees. &#x201c;Ah well, I am off to rub away the blue mould as soon as I have marched the troops back to Isca.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Going on leave?&#x201d;</p><p>The other nodded. &#x201c;Long leave, lovely leave, among the flesh-pots of Durinum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Durinum&#x2014;that is your home?&#x201d; asked Marcus. &#x201c;Yes. My father retired and settled there a few years ago. There is a surprisingly good circus, and plenty of people&#x2014;pretty girls too. A pleasant enough place to get back to, out of the wilds.&#x201d; An idea seemed to strike him. &#x201c;What shall you do when your leave falls due? I suppose, coming out from home, you have no one here to go to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have an uncle at Calleva, though I have not yet met him,&#x201d; Marcus said, &#x201c;and certainly there is no one at home I should want to spend my leave with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Father and mother both dead?&#x201d; enquired Hilarion with friendly interest.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. My father went with the Ninth Legion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pericol! You mean when they&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Disappeared. Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. That is bad!&#x201d; said Hilarion, wagging his head. &#x201c;A deal of ugly stories, there were&#x2014;still are, for that matter; and of course, they did lose the Eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>Instantly Marcus was up in arms to defend his father and his father&#x2019;s Legion. &#x201c;Since not a man of the Legion came back, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that neither did the Eagle,&#x201d; he flashed.</p><p>&#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; agreed Hilarion amicably. &#x201c;I was not blowing on your father&#x2019;s honour, so you can keep your feathers on, my Marcus.&#x201d; He looked up at the other with a wide, friendly grin, and suddenly Marcus, who had been ready to quarrel with him the instant before, found himself grinning back.</p><p>It was several hours since Marcus had marched his Cohort across the hollow-ringing bridge, answering the sentry&#x2019;s challenge, &#x201c;Fourth Gaulish Auxiliaries of the Second Legion, come to relieve this garrison.&#x201d; Dinner was over, in the officers&#x2019; mess, with the Quartermaster, the Surgeon, and the double complement of ranker Centurions. Marcus had taken charge of the pay-chest keys&#x2014;in a garrison as small as this there was no paymaster; and for the past hour, here in the Commander&#x2019;s quarters in the Praetorium, he and Hilarion had been going through the office work of the frontier fort. Now, crested helmets and embossed breastplates laid aside, the two of them were taking their ease.</p><p>Through the doorless opening Marcus could see almost the whole of the sleeping-cell, the narrow cot piled with gay native rugs, the polished oaken chest, the lamp-bracket high on the bare wall, and nothing more. The outer room held the battered writing table on which Marcus was sitting, a cross-legged camp-stool, the cushioned bench to represent comfort, another chest for the record rolls, and a bronze pedestal lamp of peculiarly hideous design.</p><p>In the little silence that had fallen between them, Marcus looked round him at the austere room in the yellow flood of lamplight, and to him it seemed beautiful. But though it would be his tomorrow, for this one night he was a guest here, and he looked back to his host with a quick smile of apology for having looked too soon at his surroundings with the eye of mastery.</p><p>Hilarion grinned. &#x201c;You will not be feeling like that this day next year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; said Marcus, swinging one sandalled foot and idly watching the swing of it. &#x201c;What does one do here, besides growing toadstools? Is there good hunting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough; it is the one thing to be said for this particular corner of the Empire. Boar and wolf in the winter, and the forest swarms with deer. There are several hunters below in the town, who will take you out for the price of the day&#x2019;s work. Unwise to go alone, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcus nodded. &#x201c;Have you any advice for me? I am new to this country.&#x201d;</p><p>The other considered. &#x201c;No, I think not.&#x201d; Then he sat up with a jerk. &#x201c;Yes, I have, if no one has warned you already. But it has nothing to do with the hunting. It is the priest-kind&#x2014;the wandering Druids. If one of them appears in the district, or you get the least idea that there is one about, look to your weapons. Good advice, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Druids?&#x201d; Marcus was surprised and puzzled. &#x201c;But surely Suetonius Paulinus dealt with them once and for all, sixty years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As an organized priesthood, maybe; but as easily hold off these heathen mists with a palm-leaf umbrella as end the Druids by destroying their strong...</p></p><h2>The Lineage of the Codes of Light</h2><p>A powerful truth-in-myth about the women of the Sisterhood of the Sun who have carried the light codes of consciousness for the coming Golden Age.

In McManus's world, nothing is what it should be. All steaks should be chicken-fried, strong coffee is drunk by the light of a campfire, and fishing trips consist of men acting like boys and boys behaving like the small animals we've always assumed they were.</p><p><i>Outdoor Life</i> magazine columnist Patrick McManus has been compared to Mark Twain. <i>Into the Twilight, Endlessly Grousing</i> demonstrates that he isn't, but McManus will suffice until the next Twain comes along. In this book, the outdoorsman extraordinaire is doing what he does best--telling fish stories, getting into scrapes with buddies, occasionally waxing philosophical, but grousing just as often. Sometimes he even ventures out of the wilderness and into mainstream humor. McManus is easily the equal of Dave Barry or any other contemporary humorist, for that matter: <blockquote> When I think of all the times a Stupidity Alarm could have saved me from committing a Stupidity ... Here's one instance that comes to mind.<br> My children: "Daddy, please buy us a horse! Please, please, please, please!"<br> Me: "Well, kids, I guess a horse wouldn't be all that much trouble."<br> Stupidity Alarm: WHOOOOP! WHOOOOP! WHOOOOP!<br> The cowboy who sold me the horse said it loved children. That was true. But as I belatedly discovered, it hated adults. </blockquote> He covers well-worn territory, sure. But McManus is a pro who tells stories well, so <i>Into the Twilight, Endlessly Grousing</i> is always diverting. And when he tells stories about his boyhood, a note of wistfulness and pathos creeps in that is definitely agreeable. This volume is a fine effort by an experienced woodsman/wordsman.Patrick F.

The world&#39;s best intelligence organization was not the least of these revelations. Also discovered were massive and meticulous research files on secret societies, eugenics and other scientific pursuits that boggled the imagination of the Allied command. Even more spectacular was an entire web of underground rocket and flying saucer factories with accompanying technology that still defies ordinary beliefs. A missing U-boat fleet possessing the most advanced submarine technology in the world left many wondering if the Nazis had escaped with yet more secrets or even with Hitler himself. Behind all of these mysteries was an even deeper element: a secret order known to initiates as the Order of the Black Sun, an organization so feared that it is now illegal to even print their symbols and insignia in modern Germany. The Black Sun probes deeper into the secrets of the Third Reich and its Tibetan contacts than any other previous attempt. Author Peter Moon ties all of these strange associations to Montauk Point, where an American military facility was used by the Nazis to further their own strange experiments and continue the agenda of the Third Reich. Peter Moon unravels more Montauk mysteries which leads to the most insightful look ever into the Third Reich and their ultimate quest: the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail. This quest penetrates the secret meaning behind the Egyptian and Tibetan &#34;Books of the Dead&#34;.

Retreating into a silent world of imagination, she crafts a plan to prove her theory--even if it means traveling the globe, alone. Suzy's achingly heartfelt journey explores life, death, the astonishing wonder of the universe...and the potential for love and hope right next door.<br><br><b> </b>Oddlot Entertainment has acquired the screen rights to <i>The Thing About Jellyfish</i>, with Gigi Pritzker set to produce with Bruna Papandrea and Reese Witherspoon.<br></p><p>Ali Benjamin is a National Book Award Finalist for <i>The Thing About Jellyfish</i>, and the co-writer for HIV-positive teen Paige Rawl's coming-of-age memoir <i>Positive</i> as well as Tim Howard's <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Keeper</i>.

She lives in Massachusetts.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Suzy's best friend, Franny Jackson, was a strong swimmer. There is no way she could have drowned, at least in Suzy's mind. Suzy's determined search for a different explanation for her friend's death leads her to believe that Franny was stung by an Irukandji jellyfish. Having nothing but time, since she has no other friends and has decided to stop talking, Suzy sets out to prove her theory. This multilayered novel takes readers on several concurrent emotional journeys. Benjamin skillfully blends time and narrative to slowly reveal truths about Suzy: first and foremost that their friendship was over long before Franny's death. The girl she had once thought was her best friend decided it was time for a middle school social upgrade, choosing popularity over her awkward childhood pal. Suzy's decision to seek revenge and remind Franny of their bond backfires, destroying what was left of their relationship. Consequently, Franny's death is the impetus for the protagonist's mission of personal reconciliation for the guilt and regret she feels over their falling out. Suzy's fierce intelligence, compounded by her painful transition into adolescence, makes her a sympathetic and compelling character. Benjamin's sense of timing and delivery is extraordinary, as she blends the visceral experiences of Suzy's journey with an internal dialogue that is authentic and poignant. Though Suzy herself is oddly unique in her self-imposed social ineptitude and singular focus, the politics of friendships and changing values of young teens will resonate with readers. Benjamin's inverse approach to tragedy, placing the death at the beginning of the novel and storytelling through the grieving process, transcends the trope, as the story triumphs in the affecting realities of emotional response and resilience. VERDICT Strong readers of middle grade realistic fiction will fully immerse themselves in this superbly written, heartfelt novel.&#x2014;Juliet Morefield, Multnomah County Library, OR</p><h2>Why You Should Read Children&#39;s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise</h2><p>Katherine Rundell - Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and prize-winning author of five novels for children - explores how children&#39;s books ignite, and can re-ignite, the imagination; how children&#39;s fiction, with its unabashed emotion and playfulness, can awaken old hungers and create new perspectives on the world.

Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. Moses never parted the Red Sea. There was a Jesus, but he wasn't born on Christmas and he probably wasn't an only child. </p><p>Davis brings readers up-to-date on findings gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels that prompt serious scholars to ask such serious questions as: Who wrote the Bible? Did Jesus say everything we were taught he did? Did he say more? By examining the Bible historically, Davis entertains and amazes, provides a much better understanding of the subject, and offers much more fun learning about it. </p></p><p>The Bible, author Kenneth Davis explains, fits that definition of a "classic" offered by Mark Twain: a book that people praise and don't read. But this entertaining historical study will likely compel listeners to reach for their dusty copies of the world's most-owned but least-understood anthology once again. And not simply because the author reminds us of the drama and intrigue, the tales of rape, impaling, and ethnic cleansing routinely found in its pages. Davis paints the larger historical context in which the Bible was written, providing a sense of the culture and environment in which the familiar stories came to life. Calling on new research and scholarship into the Bible's composition, he provides fascinating background to dimly remembered stories that gives them renewed impact. Using a series of easy-to-follow questions and answers, he offers explanations about when and by whom the Bible was written; how the stories of other traditions influenced the Judeo-Christian teachings; where the Garden of Eden might have been located; why an earthquake may have played a part in the "walls tumbling down" at Jericho; why Jesus may not have said everything we think he did, and much more. He also points out that mistranslations from the original Hebrew have made their way into modern versions of the Bible, explaining where and how they occurred. Conceding that his program will anger some, as it challenges many cherished but mistaken assumptions about the Bible, Davis also hopes that listeners recognize that Christian belief and uncovering the truth are not at odds in this program, but rather that learning and wisdom, even when they reach unsettling conclusions, can ultimately complement faith.

She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, U.C. Berkeley, and at Harvard, and taught at Dominican College in San Rafael, California, from 1958&#x2013;1972. In solidarity with the Algerian War of Independence (1954&#x2013;1962), Adnan began to resist the political implications of writing in French and became a painter. Then, through her participation in the movement against the Vietnam War (1959&#x2013;1975), she began to write poetry and became, in her words, &#x201c;an American poet.&#x201d; In 1972, she returned to Beirut and worked as cultural editor for two daily newspapers&#x2015;first for Al Safa, then for L&#x2019;Orient le Jour. Her novel Sitt Marie-Rose, published in Paris in 1977, won the France-Pays Arabes award and has been translated into more than ten languages. In 1977, Adnan re-established herself in California, making Sausalito her home, with frequent stays in Paris. Adnan is the author of more than a dozen books in English, including Journey to Mount Tamalpais (1986) The Arab Apocalypse (1989), In the Heart of the Heart of Another Country (2005), and Sea and Fog (2012), winner of the Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Poetry and the California Book Award for Poetry. In 2014, she was awarded one of France&#x2019;s highest cultural honors: l&#x2019;Ordre de Chevalier des Arts et Lettres. Many of her poems have been put to music by Tania Leon, Henry Treadgill, Gavin Bryars, Zad Moultaka, Annea Lockwood, and Bun Ching Lam. Her paintings have been widely exhibited, including Documenta 13, the 2014 Whitney Biennial, CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, The New Museum, and Museum der Moderne Salzburg. In 2014, Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art mounted a retrospective of her work.A fragmentary, aphoristic examination of night in all its illuminating darkness from a Lebanese-American poet who is also an admired visual artist. &#x2015;David Orr, The New York Times Book Review (Best of 2016 Poetry)<br><br>Renowned Lebanese-American writer Adnan maps consciousness in a book-length poem that explores night in all its permutations. Though she is more elliptical and fragmentary here&#x2015;and less narrative-driven or referential&#x2015;than in previous work, these poems engage in a daring, meditative exploration of perception and her own experiences. Adnan does this with a courageous interiority that becomes universal as the text unfolds. Memory is a particularly notable leitmotif as it relates to identity, whether personal or collective. &#x201c;I measure my memory of things, but not memory itself, as the present is also overflowing,&#x201d; she writes. These internal and societal memories lend themselves to queries about history, landscape, and the nature of consciousness. Adnan posits that memory is not a &#x201c;storage room. It&#x2019;s not a tool for being able to think, it&#x2019;s thinking, before thinking.&#x201d; As the book progresses, memory becomes increasingly knotted with loss and mortality: &#x201c;It was said that people mattered, which we did, and they lost their shine.&#x201d; Adnan never provides clear answers, but this prevents her wide-ranging assertions from becoming didactic; her evocative imagery and interwoven repetitions serve to create another memory&#x2015;one that will linger with the reader long after the text&#x2019;s conclusion. --Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The Healing Power of Trees: Spiritual Journeys Through the Celtic Tree Calendar</h2><p><p>From the birch to the willow, Sharlyn Hidalgo invites you to walk in the footsteps of the druids and enrich your life with the sacred power of trees.

In <i>Cast Two Shadows</i>, Rinaldi uses the compelling young character Caroline Whitaker to reveal how the Revolutionary War affects life on a South Carolina plantation in 1780. Fourteen-year-old Caroline is caught in the violent web of war--her Patriot father is imprisoned, her Loyalist brother Johnny is wounded, her best friend is hanged by the British before her eyes, and her sister is fast becoming the doxy of the cruel British officer who has commandeered their house. To further complicate matters, although her family chooses to ignore it, Caroline knows that she is the result of her father's dalliance with one of his black slaves. In fact, her grandmother, Miz Melindy, still lives in the slave quarters. When Caroline and Miz Melindy take a long wagon journey together (in an attempt to save Johnny), the young heroine at last comes to terms with the complexity and tumult of her life.

The dark interiors of caves, wherever they may be found, seem to have had a powerful draw for ancient peoples, who littered the cave floors with objects they had made. Later, they adorned cave walls with sacred symbols and secret knowledge, from the very first abstract symbols and handprints to complex and vivid arrangements of animals and people. Often undisturbed for many tens of thousands of years, these were among the first visual symbols that humans shared with each other, though they were made so long ago that we have entirely forgotten their meaning. However, as archaeologist Bruno David reveals, caves decorated more recently may help us to unlock their secrets.</p><p>David tells the story of this mysterious world of decorated caves, from the oldest known painting tools to the magnificent murals of the European Ice Age. Showcasing the most astounding discoveries made in more than 150 years of archaeological exploration, <em>Cave Art</em> explores the creative achievements of our remotest ancestors and what they tell us about the human past.</p> 215 illustrations</p><p>Bruno David is Associate Professor in archaeology at the Monash Indigenous Center, Monash University, Australia. His books include Hiri, the World Archaeological Congress Handbook of Landscape Archaeology, The Social Archaeology of Australian Indigenous Societies, Landscapes, Rock-Art and the Dreaming and Inscribed Landscapes. In 1994 he was awarded the inaugural Antiquity Prize for his work on the archaeology of meaning in rock art, in 2007 the Australian Archaeological Association&#x2019;s Bruce Veitch Award for Excellence in Indigenous Engagement, and in 2013 the Ben Cullen Prize for writings on the social construction of caves and rockshelters. His current research involves working in partnership with Indigenous communities in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea, exploring the historical connections that people have formed with places and documenting the antiquity of rock art and its meaning to local communities today.</p><h2>The Rediscovery of North America</h2><p>Five hundred years ago an Italian whose name, translated into English, meant Christopher Dove, came to America and began a process not of discovery, but incursion -- &#34;a ruthless, angry search for wealth&#34; that continues to the present day. This provocative and superbly written book gives a true assessment of Columbus&#39;s legacy while taking the first steps toward its redemption. Even as he draws a direct line between the atrocities of Spanish conquistadors and the ongoing pillage of our lands and waters, Barry Lopez challenges us to adopt an ethic that will make further depredations impossible. The Rediscovery of North America is a ringingly persuasive call for us, at long last, to make this country our home.</p><p>&#34;Eloquent, deep-reaching...may heads of state, students and stock clerks alike read this important volume; and may we all listen to its lesson.&#34; -- Bloomsbury ReviewBarry Lopez is the author of six works of nonfiction and eight works of fiction.

It is, as Walker Percy wrote, "a touching, deeply felt and memorable account of one man's pilgrimage."</p><p>Willie Morris always wrote from the heart and with a generosity of spirit. His first book, <i>North Toward Home</i>, was published to extraordinary acclaim in 1967. It was to be his signature work, a memoir on which all his other books would pivot. In <i>North Toward Home</i> he found his voice and discovered his identity. <p> This self-styled "autobiography in mid-passage" is one man's emotional journey to understanding his own southern origins while reluctantly coming to regard the North as home. As Morris chronicles his own experiences during the nineteen forties, fifties, and sixties he also explains their relationship to the larger contemporaneous trends in America. </p><p> And critics applauded. A New Republic reviewer noted that "it is this ambitious attempt to relate recent personal experience to history that gives North Toward Home its character and attraction." A writer for America went a step further. "It wasn't enough that in 1967, at the age of 32, Willie Morris became the editor of Harper's, the oldest and one of the most prestigious magazines in America. He had to compound our amazement by producing this autobiography, one of the best books of the year in any category." </p><p> To honor and remember Willie Morris' literary legacy, this book is reissued in hardcover on the sixty-fifth anniversary of his birth--November 29, 1999--as a commemorative edition of a true American classic.</p>"<b>North Toward Home</b> is the finest evocation of an American boyhood since Mark Twain."--<i>Sunday Times</i> (London)<br><br>"Vivid sketches of personas and places, moments when the spirit of things is caught with affecting precision....

Professor Westfall treats all aspects of Newton&#39;s career, but his account centres on a full description of Newton&#39;s achievements in science. Thus the core of the work describes the development of the calculus, the experimentation that altered the direction of the science of optics, and especially the investigations in celestial dynamics that led to the law of universal gravitation.</p><p>Destined to become the standard biography of Isaac Newton, this meticulously detailed work is focused on his scientific career, but also deals with every facet of his life. It presents an encompassing picture of Newton--the man, scientist, philosopher, theologian and public figure."The hallmarks are impeccable detail and clarity...The copious footnotes, for example, generally refer to original manuscripts, letters and memoranda that are out of reach of most students and scholars. The superb quality of this book promises to give it a prominent place in the modern scholarly literature about Isaac Newton." David L. Heiserman, Science Books &amp; Films<br><br>"Although there have been other biographies of Newton in the past, this is the first one to be based on an extensive use of the manuscript sources. It is more than merely the biography of a man and an account of the development of his ideas. It is a fundamental resource work on the Scientific Revolution, a work that should be on the shelves of every scholar interested in the main currents of ideas of the seventeenth century or any aspects of the early history of modern science."

Angela Y. Davis' life and work have been dedicated to examining this fundamental question and to ending all forms of oppression that deny people their political, cultural, and sexual freedom. In this collection of twelve searing, previously unpublished speeches, Davis confronts the interconnected issues of power, race, gender, class, incarceration, conservatism, and the ongoing need for social change in the United States. With her characteristic brilliance, historical insight, and penetrating analysis, Davis addresses examples of institutional injustice and explores the radical notion of freedom as a collective striving for real democracy - not something granted or guaranteed through laws, proclamations, or policies, but something that grows from a participatory social process that demands new ways of thinking and being. "The speeches gathered together here are timely and timeless," writes Robin D.G. Kelley in the foreword, "they embody Angela Davis' uniquely radical vision of the society we need to build, and the path to get there."</p><p><i>The Meaning of Freedom</i> articulates a bold vision of the society we need to build and the path to get there.

Still with us, thank goodness!"<br>&#x2014;<i>Virginian-Pilot</i></p><p>"Long before 'race/gender' became the obligatory injunction it is now, Angela Davis was developing an analytical framework that brought all of these factors into play.

Kelley author of <i>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</i></p><p>"There was a time in America when to call a person an 'abolitionist' was the ultimate epithet.

There were many reasons why this composite nation ultimately broke apart, but the fact that enslaved black people repeatedly risked their lives to flee their masters in the South in search of freedom in the North proved that the "united" states was actually a lie. Fugitive slaves exposed the contradiction between the myth that slavery was a benign institution and the reality that a nation based on the principle of human equality was in fact a prison-house in which millions of Americans had no rights at all. By awakening northerners to the true nature of slavery, and by enraging southerners who demanded the return of their human "property," fugitive slaves forced the nation to confront the truth about itself.<br><br>By 1850, with America on the verge of collapse, Congress reached what it hoped was a solution-- the notorious Compromise of 1850, which required that fugitive slaves be returned to their masters. Like so many political compromises before and since, it was a deal by which white Americans tried to advance their interests at the expense of black Americans. Yet the Fugitive Slave Act, intended to preserve the Union, in fact set the nation on the path to civil war. It divided not only the American nation, but also the hearts and minds of Americans who struggled with the timeless problem of when to submit to an unjust law and when to resist. <br><br>The fugitive slave story illuminates what brought us to war with ourselves and the terrible legacies of slavery that are with us still.</p><p><b>Andrew Delbanco&nbsp;</b>is the Alexander Hamilton Professor of American Studies at Columbia University.&nbsp; Author of&nbsp;many notable books, including <i>College, Melville, The Death of Satan, Required Reading, The Real American Dream,&nbsp;</i>and <i>The Puritan Ordeal, </i>he was recently appointed president of the Teagle Foundation, which supports liberal education for college students of all backgrounds.&nbsp; Winner of the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates, he is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Delbanco has too subtle a sensibility, too fine an appreciation of the tragedy of life, for that crude kind of history writing.

It had taken days to arrange the boat and the safe house and then, just a few hours before the pickup, the wind started, a poyraz, howling down from the northeast, scooping up water as it swept across the Black Sea. The Bosphorus waves, usually no higher than boat wakes by the time they reached the shuttered yalis along the shore, now churned and smashed against the landing docks. From the quay, Leon could barely make out the Asian side, strings of faint lights hidden behind a scrim of driving rain. Who would risk it? Even the workhorse ferries would be thrown off schedule, never mind a bribed fishing boat. He imagined the fisherman calculating his chances: a violent sea, sightless, hoping the sudden shape forty meters away wasn&#x2019;t a lumbering freighter, impossible to dodge. Or another day safe in port, securing ropes and drinking plum brandy by the cast-iron stove. Who could blame him? Only a fool went to sea in a storm. The passenger could wait. Days of planning.

We&#x2019;re still saving Jews.&#x201d; He made a wry face. &#x201c;Now from our friends. No visas for Palestine. Where should they go, Poland? And I&#x2019;m helping you talk to a Nazi. A wonderful world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why a Nazi?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why all this? Some poor refugee? No, someone who knows the Russians, I think. And who knows better?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re guessing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter to you? What you deliver?&#x201d;<br> <br>Leon looked away, then down at his watch. &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s not coming tonight. Whoever he is. I&#x2019;d better call. Make sure. There&#x2019;s a caf�.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mihai leaned forward to start the car again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pull around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, stay here. I don&#x2019;t want the car&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see. You run across the road in the rain. Get wet. Then you run back. Again, wet. To a waiting car. That will be less suspicious. If anyone is watching.&#x201d; He put the car in gear.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your car,&#x201d; Leon said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You think they haven&#x2019;t seen it by now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have they? You&#x2019;d know,&#x201d; he said, a question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Always assume yes.&#x201d; He made a turn across the road, pulling up in front of the caf�. &#x201c;So do the expected thing. Stay dry. Tell me something. If he had come, your package, was I going to drive him to&#x2014;wherever he&#x2019;s staying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mihai nodded. &#x201c;Better.&#x201d; He motioned his head to the side window. &#x201c;Make the call. Before they wonder.&#x201d;<br> <br>There were four men playing dominoes and sipping tea from tulip glasses. When they looked up, Leon became what he wanted them to see&#x2014;a ferengi caught in the rain, shaking water from his hat, needing a phone&#x2014;and he flushed, a little pulse of excitement. A taste for it. Had Mihai seen it somehow, the way it felt, getting away with something. The planning, the slipping away. Tonight he&#x2019;d taken the tram to the last stop in Bebek and walked up to the clinic. A trip he&#x2019;d made over and over. If he&#x2019;d been followed, they&#x2019;d stay parked a block away from the clinic gates and wait, relieved to be snug, out of the rain, knowing where he was. But just past the big oleander bushes, he&#x2019;d headed for the garden side gate, doubling back to the Bosphorus road where Mihai was waiting, feeling suddenly free, almost exhilarated. No one would have seen him in the dark. If they were there, they&#x2019;d be smoking, bored, thinking he was inside. This other life, just walking to the car, was all his own.<br> <br>The phone was on the wall near the WC. No sounds in the room but the click of tiles and the hiss of boiling water, so the token seemed to clang going in. A ferengi speaking English, the men would say. If anyone asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tommy?&#x201d; At home, luckily, not out to dinner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, I was hoping you&#x2019;d call,&#x201d; he said, a genial club voice with the clink of ice at the back of it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re after that report&#x2014;I know, I know&#x2014;and my steno never showed. Trouble with the boats. Typical, isn&#x2019;t it? First hint of weather and the ferries&#x2014;&#x201d; Leon imagined his round face at the other end, the jawline filling in, fleshy. &#x201c;I can have it for you tomorrow, all right? I mean, the contract&#x2019;s all right. We&#x2019;re just waiting for the quotas. I&#x2019;ve had American Tobacco on the phone half the day, so you&#x2019;re all in the same boat on this one. All we need now are the signatures.&#x201d; At Commercial Corp., the wartime agency that was Tommy&#x2019;s cover at the consulate.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right. I&#x2019;m stuck here at the clinic anyway. Just wanted to check. If it was on its way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Tomorrow now. Sorry about this. Let me make it up to you. Buy you a drink at the Park.&#x201d; An off note. This late?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in Bebek.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a head start.&#x201d; An order, then. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll roll you home.&#x201d; Their standard joke, Leon&#x2019;s apartment building just down the hill from the Park Hotel, before Aya Pa&#x15f;a made its wide curve.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From Bebek?&#x201d; Surprised, an edge now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take a look outside. It&#x2019;ll be a crawl in this. Just save me a stool.&#x201d;<br> <br>The domino players were looking down, pretending not to listen. But what would they have made of it anyway? Leon ordered a tea, a way of thanking the barman for the phone. The glass was warm in his hand, and he realized he was cold everywhere else, the wet beginning to seep through his shoes. And now the Park, everyone looking and not looking, Tommy&#x2019;s old-boy voice getting louder with each drink.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rain check,&#x201d; he said to Mihai, getting into the car. &#x201c;You free tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mihai nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s up. We&#x2019;re having a drink at the Park.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very exciting, the tobacco business.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leon smiled. &#x201c;It used to be.&#x201d;<br> <br>In fact, it had been sleepy, as routine and predictable as a Book of Hours. Agents bought the cured Latakia leaf, and he arranged the shipments, then took the train to Ankara to get the export permits. Leave Haydarpa&#x15f;a at six, arrive the next morning at ten. That&#x2019;s how it had started, carrying things on the train for Tommy, papers they couldn&#x2019;t put in the diplomatic pouch, something for the war effort. No money involved then. An American helping out, not just standing around at the club getting drunk with Socony and Liggett &amp; Myers and Western Electric, the men interchangeable, lucky businessmen sitting out the war. Tommy asked him to help Commercial Corp. buy up chromium, so the Germans wouldn&#x2019;t get it, and suddenly he was in the war after all, the peculiar one that played out over dinner at Abdullah&#x2019;s or those consulate receptions where the sides lined up on either end of the room, cocktail wars. What surprised him later, when he knew more, was how many others were in it too. Tracking shipping through the straits. Collecting gossip. Turning a commercial attach� who needed the money. Everyone spinning webs, watching one another, the Turkish Emniyet watching them. Nothing sleepy anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drop you home. You&#x2019;ll want to change.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, just back to the village. I want to go to the clinic. Look in.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mihai waited until they were almost there. &#x201c;How is she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; Leon said, his voice neutral.<br> <br>And then there was nothing to say. Still, he&#x2019;d asked. Anna was still alive to him, a presence, not just someone in Obstbaum&#x2019;s clinic who had retreated into herself, gone somewhere behind her own eyes. People used to ask all the time&#x2014;painful questions at the club, an awkward concern at the office&#x2014;but gradually they began to forget she was still there. Out of sight, out of mind. Except Leon&#x2019;s, a wound that wouldn&#x2019;t close. Any day she might come back, just as quickly as she had gone away. Someone had to be there waiting.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I think?&#x201d; Mihai said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes I think you do this for her. To prove something. I don&#x2019;t know what.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leon was quiet, not answering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you still talk to her?&#x201d; Mihai said finally.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her we got a boat out. She&#x2019;ll like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Past the British patrols?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So far. Otherwise we&#x2019;d be in Cyprus. Tell her three hundred. We saved three hundred.&#x201d;<br> <br>He took the same side street back, the same garden entrance. He&#x2019;d expected to have to ring, but the door was unlocked and he frowned, annoyed the staff had been so careless. But no one was trying to get out and who would want to get in? The clinic was really a kind of nursing home, a place to be out of the way. Dr. Obstbaum had been one of the German refugees welcomed by Atat�rk in the thirties to help the new republic get up on its feet. The ones who could afford it had moved to Bebek or, closer in, Ortak�y, where hillsides covered in fir trees and lindens may have reminded them of home. Or maybe, lemminglike, they had simply followed the first settler. Most of the clinic&#x2019;s medical staff was still German, which Leon had thought might help, her own language something she would understand, if she was still listening. But of course the nurses, the people who bathed her and fed her and chattered around her, were Turkish, so in the end he realized it didn&#x2019;t matter and now he worried that she was more isolated than ever. Dr. Obstbaum himself encouraged Leon to talk.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have no idea what she hears. This form of melancholia&#x2014;it may be a matter of responding, not awareness. Her brain hasn&#x2019;t shut down. Otherwise she wouldn&#x2019;t be breathing, or have any motor functions. The idea is to keep up the level of activity. Over time maybe it grows. So, music. Does she hear it? I don&#x2019;t know. But the brain does, somewhere. Something functions.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not disturbing music, but things she knew, had played at home. Lovely notes to fill the silence in her. If she heard them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of the time I think I&#x2019;m talking to myself,&#x201d; Leon had said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone here talks to himself,&#x201d; Obstbaum had said, a puckish joke. &#x201c;One of life&#x2019;s great pleasures, evidently. You at least are being asked.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late,&#x201d; the nurse said in Turkish, a hushed whisper, her eyes glancing down to the water dripping from his coat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is she asleep? I&#x2019;ll just say good-night. I&#x2019;m sorry about&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>But the nurse was already opening the door, brusque, the client&#x2019;s whims no business of hers. He&#x2019;d sit and talk, the way he always did, and she&#x2019;d have to check back again, another round, but it was a private clinic and he was paying.<br> <br>Anna was lying in bed, the room shadowy, only a dim night-light on. When he touched her hand, she opened her eyes, but looked at him without recognition. It was the disconcerting thing, the way she took in what was happening around her without responding. Having her hair brushed, people moving across the room&#x2014;things happened far away, just little blurs of movement.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Warm enough? There&#x2019;s a terrible storm.&#x201d; He nodded toward the French windows, the sound of rain on the glass.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t say anything, but he no longer expected her to. Even her hand didn&#x2019;t touch back. When he talked, he answered for her, silent responses to keep things going. Sometimes, sitting next to her, he&#x2019;d actually hear her voice in his head, a ghost conversation, even worse than talking to himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;But this is nice, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said, indicating the room. &#x201c;Cozy. Gem�tlich.&#x201d; As if a change of language would matter.<br> <br>He let her hand go and sat down in the chair.<br> <br>When they first met, she&#x2019;d never seemed to stop talking, bubbling over, switching from German to English as if one language couldn&#x2019;t contain it, everything she had to say. And her eyes had been everywhere, ahead of the words sometimes, waiting for them to catch up, lighting her face. The odd thing was that the face was still her own, stopped in time, the wonderful skin, the soft line of her cheek, everything just the way it always had been, aging itself put off while she was away. Only the eyes were different, vacant.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw Mihai tonight. He sends his love. He said they got a boat through. People are getting out again.&#x201d; Something that might register, what she cared about. Don&#x2019;t try to startle her, Obstbaum had said, just ordinary things, domestic matters. But how did Obstbaum know? Had he been to where she lived now? Did it matter to her that Fatma had been ill, sent her sister to do the cleaning? &#x201c;Three hundred,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So they must be operating again. Mossad. Who else could it be? A boat that big.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stopped. The last thing he should have said, a reminder. Obstbaum thought it had happened then, when the Bratianu sank. Corpses bobbing in the water. Children. Her brain turning away from it, drawing a curtain. Obstbaum had even suggested she be put in a garden room, not a front one facing the Bosphorus, where ships passed all day, each one a possible reminder. Leon had gone along with him. Everyone in Istanbul wanted to see the water&#x2014;in Ottoman times there had been laws about builders blocking the view&#x2014;so a garden room was cheaper. And it was pleasant, looking toward the hillside, cypresses and umbrella pines and a Judas tree that dropped pink blossoms in the spring. A fortune back home but something he could manage here. And not a boat in sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I might need Romanian. They bring someone out but they don&#x2019;t tell you who. They want me to babysit. I got Georg&#x2019;s old landlo...</p><h2>You Can Run, But You Can&#39;t Hide</h2><p>"Freeze!"<p>Duane "Dog" Chapman entertains and inspires millions on Dog the Bounty Hunter, his #1-rated show on A&amp;E -- but there is more to his story.

She lives with her daughter in Melbourne, Australia.<i><br></i><i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The almost ripe moon hung in the midnight sky, and the heat of it sang through my veins. Being a werewolf at this time of the month generally meant fun times, because we celebrated the moon's bloom with a sensual week of intimacy. One that involved much loving and many different partners. Although for me, there was currently only one man, and he was neither an ordinary man nor a werewolf&#x2014;although as a vampire, he certainly had enough stamina to satisfy the hunger of any wolf.<br><br>Of course, I wasn't just a wolf, but when the moon bloomed toward fullness, it was she who reigned supreme, rather than the vampire half of my soul. <br><br>But I was also a guardian, and it was an unfortunate fact that the bad guys of this world had absolutely no respect for the moon or a werewolf's needs.<br><br>Which was why I was now stalking through the deserted backstreets of Coolaroo, following a scent that was all death and violence, rather than being curled up beside my vampire, enjoying his caresses.<br><br>The night itself was crisp and cold, and I had a killer case of goose bumps. If I'd had the time, I would have gone home to grab a sweater, but Jack&#x2014;my boss, and the vampire in charge of the whole Guardian division&#x2014;had insisted it couldn't wait. That lives depended on me catching this idiot before he could kill again. <br><br>Of course, I'd felt the need to point out that he had a veritable truckload of leashed killers sitting in the underground floors of the Directorate, every one of them just aching to be set loose on bad guys. After which, he'd kindly pointed out that if I hadn't lost said killer in the first place, he wouldn't be out killing tonight.<br><br>A point I could hardly argue with given it was true, so I'd shut up, kissed Quinn good-bye, and driven straight to the crime scene.<br><br>Only to discover another dead human. Like the teenager who'd been killed several nights ago, tonight's victim had been drained of blood. But it wasn't a vampire doing this, because their throats had been slashed rather than bitten, and vampires rarely went to that sort of trouble. Not unless they considered mutilating the bodies of their victims part of the fun, anyway.<br><br>Besides, vampires were rarely wasteful when it came to blood, and while both these teenagers had been drained, a whole lot of blood had been smeared across their necks, faces, and the ground. It was almost as if someone had slashed, and then tried to gulp down the resulting surge. <br><br>I shuddered. Tonight's death was my fault, because I'd let the damned killer escape me days before.<br>And the fact that he'd seemingly disappeared into thin air wasn't an excuse. I was a trained hunter-killer, and no matter how much I might sometimes rail against it, there was no going back for me now. Therefore, I had to do the best that I could. And letting a killer go free to kill again definitely wasn't my best.<br><br>I blew out a breath and studied the night ahead. Evil was out there, just beyond my line of sight. The scent I followed was a foul thing that hung heavily on the cool night air, reminding me oddly of meat left rotting in the sun.<br><br>And I had no idea what it was, because he certainly didn't smell like any other nonhuman I'd ever come across.<br><br>Although he didn't smell human, either, even if the description we'd gotten off a witness matched that of a man who was listed as human. Only he was also very dead.<br><br>I'd immediately started imagining scenarios featuring killer zombies out for vengeance, but Jack claimed I'd been watching too many horror movies. According to him, while zombies could kill, it wasn't through any basic desire or need of their own. They weren't capable of thought or emotion, and were little more than receptacles for the deadly desires of others.<br><br>Which was a fancy way of saying someone else was in charge and directing the action. Only there was never any hint of that other person, either at the crime scene or when I'd been tracking the dead man. <br><br>If there was another nut behind the wheel, though, then he'd found himself the perfect killer. One that did whatever he was raised to do without question or deviation, then fell down dead again afterward.<br><br>Except that this man, whether he be zombie or something else, didn't seem to be showing any signs of slowing down or dropping dead.<br><br>Although surely a dead body could only move around for so long before bits began falling off or rotting started becoming a real problem. <br><br>And given the scent I was following, he was definitely well on the way to putrefaction. It was surprising he could move so quickly without doing himself serious damage.&nbsp; <br><br>I shivered and rubbed my arms, suddenly glad that I made a habit of keeping my laser in the car. Its weight was a comfortable presence in my back pocket. <br><br>Once upon a time, a thought like that might have scared me, but I'd been through too much of late. Even a werewolf intent on not becoming a mindless killer needed the help of a weapon occasionally.<br><br>I walked on. In the distance, a freight train whistled, the lonely sound mingling with the roar of traffic traveling along nearby Pascoe Vale road. Little seemed to be moving through these streets however, although there were lights on in several of the nearby houses.<br><br>I sucked in a breath, my nostrils flaring as I sorted through the aromas running through the cold air. My dead-smelling killer had moved into a side street. I followed, my sneaker-clad feet making little noise on the concrete. I'd mostly given up wearing heels for everyday work. The wooden stilettos might come in handy for staking the occasional rogue vampire, but running in the things across some of the terrain we had to traverse had proved too damned dangerous. And heels and ladders definitely didn't go together&#x2014;as I'd discovered a week ago when I was chasing a rogue vamp. I'd earned another scar for that&#x2014;this one across the top of my left hand. The same hand that was missing its little pinky. <br><br>The bad guys seemed to have a vendetta against my left limb.<br><br>The dead scent was getting stronger, though there was still no sign of the man. The warehouses that lined either side of this street were dark and silent, and the only life visible was the occasional cat.<br><br>The street came to a T-intersection. I paused, looking left then right. Still no sign of him in the darkness. I blinked, flicking to the infrared of my vampire vision, but the night remained devoid of the heat of life.<br><br>Which I guess, if he was dead, made total sense.<br><br>I followed my nose and headed left. Down at the end of the street was a gate and, beyond that, huge towers of paper and plastic. A recycling plant, obviously.<br><br>But why would a dead guy want to go to a recycling plant? It couldn't be an effort to get rid of any sort of evidence, because if he'd been intent on doing that, he wouldn't have left the mutilated bodies of his victims in easy viewing of anyone who happened to pass by. <br><br>So was this really some weird form of revenge killing, as Jack had surmised, or was something stranger going on?<br><br>I suspected the latter, but that might be just my pessimistic streak coming out. After all, fate had a way of ensuring shit always got flung my way when I least wanted or needed it.<br><br>And in the midst of moon heat, it was most definitely unwanted.<br><br>The scent swung right, drawing me onto a smaller street, barely big enough to get a truck through. The wind filled the night with a forlorn moan as it gusted through the many broken windows that seemed to dominate the buildings here, and the shadows became thicker with the absence of street lighting.<br><br>Not that I needed light, especially when the moon shone so brightly, but it still felt better to enter a street lit by lights than one without them. Especially when I was alone, and following God-knows-what.<br><br>The thought had me touching my ear to turn on the tracker part of the com-link device that had been inserted a while ago. All Directorate personnel involved in field operations, whether guardians or not, now had them. Jack and the other division heads shared a dislike of losing people, and the units gave not only an instant position but allowed communication if things went sour.<br><br>Of course, in my line of work, things going sour usually meant death. And, more often than not, the cavalry had been known to arrive far too late. So far, my brother and I had been lucky, but given fate's delight in throwing curveballs our way, I often wondered just how long it would be before she threw us the biggest curveball of all.<br><br>Death wasn't something I really wanted to dwell on, but I guess when I was dealing it out myself on an almost daily basis, it was hard not to think about it hitting closer to home than my twin, Rhoan, and I might like. Especially when his lover, Liander, had barely escaped his end three weeks ago.<br><br>I didn't want to die. I didn't want Rhoan to die, either, but the fact was, death would probably come hunting us sooner rather than later. There was no way around it. Not unless I wanted to become a vampire, and really, I enjoyed sunshine too much. I didn't want to wait a thousand years to be able to enjoy it again.<br><br>From somewhere up ahead came the slight rattle of metal. I slowed and listened intently. The sound didn't repeat, and the hair rose on the back of my neck. Something was decidedly off&#x2014;something other than a walking dead man.<br><br>I moved into the deeper shadows, hugging the old buildings. The wind continued to moan, and the chill in the air seemed to be increasing. Or maybe that was just an amplifying side effect of the fear sitting like a weight in my stomach.<br><br>The street swung around to the left. Factories continued to line either side, but directly ahead was a high chain-link security fence. Beyond it was the recycling plant. I couldn't see my quarry moving through the corridors of paper, but logic&#x2014;and the slight metallic rattle I'd heard&#x2014;suggested he'd climbed the fence and was now in there somewhere.<br><br>And yet . . .<br><br>I looked at the building to my left. Like the other warehouses in this street, it was run-down and abandoned. Tin rattled on the roof and the wind whistled through the many broken windows. I could smell nothing out of place, and there was no sign of life-heat in the building&#x2014;which in itself didn't mean anything when I was chasing a dead man. <br><br>But he was a dead man with no apparent mind of his own, so he was obviously running into this area for a reason. Given he'd done a quick side step last night to lose me, I was betting he was trying the same thing tonight. And I was also betting that he'd probably gone into the warehouse rather than the more obvious recycling plant. <br><br>However, if he was meeting his maker in that warehouse, why couldn't I see them? Was it because there seemed to be no light source whatsoever in the heart of the building, or was there something blocking it? Even though my infrared vision was far better than the night-vision devices used by the military, no infrared was going to work properly in utter blackness. Both the man-made devices and vampire vision needed some sort of heat or light source available. <br><br>If I was the betting type, I'd be putting money on the fact that something was blocking me. After all, a warehouse with that many broken windows surely wouldn't have a pit of blackness at its center.<br><br>I looked back at the fence. The scent trail and the metallic rattling I'd heard were both indicative of the fact that my quarry had gone that way. But I'd trusted those two things before and had lost him.<br><br>Perhaps it was time to trust my other senses, which were pulling me toward the warehouse.<br><br>Of course, my clairvoyance was often a nebulous thing that refused to be pinned down to any direct information. Jack and the Directorate magi he'd roped in to train me kept insisting that not only would it become stronger as time went by, but I would learn how to fully utilize it. So far, they'd been proved wrong. Although if my ability to see souls was part of my clairvoyance, then maybe they weren't so off the mark. The damn things were now conversing with me as easily as the living, although that was one part of the gift I could have done without.<br><br>The ice of the night seemed to intensify as I neared the broken building. I ignored the chills running down my spine, and followed the graffiti-littered wall until I found the main entrance. The door hung off one of its hinges and swayed slightly in the soft breeze. Beyond it was a tumble of glass, smashed boxes, and rubbish. The air drifting out was rank with the smell of urine and unwashed bodies, suggesting this might have been a squat for the homeless, even though I couldn't see any life-heat within. Maybe something had chased them off.<br><br>Something that resembled a dead man walking.<br><br>I reached back to grab my laser, then turned it on and stepped inside, keeping my back to the wall as I quickly scanned the first room. A half-circular desk dominated the left side of the room, which suggested this had once been the warehouse's main reception area. There were two glass-fronted offices along the wall behind the desk, but there was nothing or no one hiding in either of them. Not that I could see or smell, anyway.<br><br>There were several doorways leading off this main room and, after a moment's hesitation, I chose the one directly ahead. That's where the big blackness lay, and that's probably where I'd find my dead man&#x2014;if my psi senses were right and he hadn't actually gone over the fence as my more mundane senses of smell and hearing had suggested.<br><br>Glass crunched softly under my feet as I picked my way through the rubbish, my laser held at the ready and every sense I had tuned for the slightest hint of movement or life. But there was nothing. The only sounds were the wind and my own breathing, which wasn't quite as steady as I would have liked.<br><br>The doorway led into a short corridor and, at the far end, a set of swinging doors. Two other doors led off the corridor itself, but neither of these were open. I hesitated at the swinging doors, flicking to infrared and searching the room beyond. Once again, there was nothing to suggest there was any sort of life&#x2014;or unlife&#x2014;laying in wait, but that strange blackness was filling it.</p><h2>Once We Were Brothers</h2><p>Elliot Rosenzweig, a wealthy Chicago philanthropist, is attending opening night at the opera.&nbsp; Ben Solomon, a retired Polish immigrant, makes his way through the crowd and shoves a gun in Rosenzweig's face, denouncing him as former SS officer, Otto Piatek. &nbsp; Solomon is blind-sided, knocked to the floor and taken away.&nbsp; Rosenzweig uses his enormous influence to get Solomon released from jail, but Solomon commences a relentless pursuit to bring Rosenzweig before the courts to answer for war crimes.&nbsp; Solomon finds a young attorney, Catherine Lockhart, to whom he recounts his family's struggles and heroisms during the war, revealing to her that he and Piatek grew up as brothers in the same household.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i></i><p></p><i>Once We Were Brothers</i>&nbsp;is a contemporary legal thriller and a poignant look back into the lives of small town Poland during World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>The author, Ronald H.

He was eighty-three years old and getting dressed for Judgment Day. Years had come and gone since he had last worn his tuxedo, but then, Judgment Day was a black tie affair. <br>He uttered a Polish phrase to the man in the mirror and reached into his pocket to reexamine his pricey ticket. <br> <i>Lyric Opera of Chicago. Opening Night Gala, September 26, 2004. La Forza del Destino</i>. <i>Main Floor, Aisle 2, Row kk, Seat 103&#x2014;</i>a seat he did not intend to occupy. Truth be told, he didn&#x2019;t care much for opera. The ticket had set him back five hundred dollars, a goodly sum for a pensioner. <br>He pulled back the cuff of his shirtsleeve to check the time on his watch, a silver-band Citizen given to him when he retired from the Chicago Park District eight years ago. Four thirty&#x2014;still two hours until the doors would open. He walked into his living room. <br>The windows of his modest one-bedroom apartment faced east, toward Lake Michigan and the row of condominium towers that stretched north in a line from the Loop to Thorndale Avenue like a stand of Midwest corn. The late-afternoon sun laid a track of shadows across Lake Shore Drive and onto the lush grass of the Waveland Golf Course, where he&#x2019;d worked as a starter for almost fifty years. To his right, in the mirrored calm of Belmont Harbor, the luxury cruisers rested comfortably in their slips. He lingered. How he loved that view. He conceded that he might be looking at it for the last time. <br>Once more he checked his appearance in the mirror. He asked Hannah if he looked all right. Was he dapper? He wished she were there to answer. <br>Underneath his sweaters, in the bottom drawer of his bureau, lay a cardboard cigar box. Setting the box on the bureau top, he lifted the lid and removed a German P08 Luger, World War II vintage, in mint condition, purchased at an antique gun show for $1,250. Another hit to his savings account. He stuffed the pistol in his belt beneath his cummerbund. <br>Five o&#x2019;clock. Time to walk to the corner, flag a southbound taxi, and join up with the glitterati at the &#x201c;undisputed jewel of the social season.&#x201d; <br>TWO <br>&nbsp; <br>IN HIS DRESSING ROOM on the second story of his Winnetka mansion, a generous four-acre estate set high on a bluff overlooking the lake, Elliot Rosenzweig stood fumbling with his cuff links. &#x201c;Jennifer,&#x201d; he called out, &#x201c;would you come help me, please?&#x201d; <br>The young medical student, sparkling in her formal evening gown, breezed into the master suite and to the side of her grandfather, who was grappling with his French cuffs. <br>&#x201c;Popi, we&#x2019;re going to be late if we don&#x2019;t hurry.&#x201d; <br>He watched her hands easily fasten the gold links. So supple, so young. Soon to be a surgeon&#x2019;s hands, he thought. <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said. <br>Beaming with profound adoration, he kissed her on the forehead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so proud of you,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;For fastening your cuffs?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For being my angel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I love you, too, Popi.&#x201d; She twirled and headed for the closet door. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a beautiful dress,&#x201d; he called after her. &#x201c;I like it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You should,&#x201d; she said over her shoulder, &#x201c;it cost you a fortune. Nonna bought it for me at Giselle&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s an original. Is Nonna going tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m afraid not. She has another one of her headaches.&#x201d; He winked. &#x201c;She hates these public events.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer lifted his Armani jacket from the hanger and held it for him as he slipped his arms through the sleeves. Smiling, she gave a short tug on his lapels and took a step back. <br>&#x201c;You look very handsome tonight.&#x201d; She kissed him on his cheek. &#x201c;Now we need to go. All our friends are waiting.&#x201d; <br>Together, hand in hand, they joined the rest of their entourage under the pink stone portico where the group filed into two limousines that would carry them downtown to the Civic Opera House. The iron security gates parted and the white limousines glided forward onto Sheridan Road and toward Chicago&#x2019;s Loop. <br>THREE <br>&nbsp; <br>FESTIVAL BANNERS HUNG FROM the art deco columns of the Civic Opera House&#x2019;s mezzanine and multicolored buntings looped from the balustrades, all gaily surrounding the opera celebrants gathered in the foyer below. Costumed servers carried champagne and hors d&#x2019;oeuvres on silver platters. In the corner, a subgroup of the Lyric Orchestra played selections from Rossini overtures. <br>Raising her voice to be heard above the din of conversations, Jennifer asked, &#x201c;How many years have you been coming to opening night, Popi?&#x201d; She smiled as she accepted a canap� from an Elizabethan palace guard. <br>&#x201c;Since 1958, angel. Although in those days they didn&#x2019;t pay so much attention to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You mean you weren&#x2019;t a Platinum Grand Benefactor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I always gave what I could to support the arts, but&#x2026;&#x201d; His answer was interrupted by the approach of Chicago&#x2019;s mayor and first lady, who were being shuttled about by Lyric&#x2019;s artistic director. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you again, Elliot. You&#x2019;re looking well.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think you know my granddaughter, Jennifer,&#x201d; he answered in the noisy hall. &#x201c;It always brightens my day to see you and Edith.&#x201d; Rosenzweig flashed a congenial smile as he warmly took the hand of Chicago&#x2019;s first lady. <br>&#x201c;Quite an event, the Lyric opening, thanks to you and the board,&#x201d; said Mayor Burton. &#x201c;The city owes you a great deal, Elliot. You&#x2019;re a priceless resource.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe <i>not</i> so priceless, John.&#x201d; And the two of them laughed. <br>While they continued to exchange flatteries, Ben Solomon quietly wound his way through the crowd toward the Grand Benefactor. He was oblivious to the music. He heard no conversations. He saw only his target. Making his way across the floor, he declined a flute of champagne from a seventeenth-century Italian peasant girl and felt for the Luger in his belt. The Lyric quartet pizzicatoed through the delightful strains of <i>La Gazza Ladra.</i> <br>He paused until the mayor and his wife had moved on to the next grouping and walked directly to Rosenzweig, his heart pounding like a pile driver. <br>&#x201c;What did you do with all that jewelry?&#x201d; he said inches from Rosenzweig&#x2019;s face. <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, sir?&#x201d; said the esteemed donor with a smile, unsure if this was part of a staged repertoire. Perhaps an opera joke? <br>But there was no sign of frivolity. &#x201c;Just curious,&#x201d; Solomon said. &#x201c;I asked you what you did with the jewelry&#x2014;you know, the watches, diamond bracelets, wedding bands. You had a whole chest full. Don&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d; <br>Rosenzweig looked to his granddaughter and shrugged. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, sir.&#x201d; <br>In a flash, Solomon drew the polished Luger and pressed the barrel hard against Rosenzweig&#x2019;s forehead. A woman screamed. The crowd immediately backpedaled into a large ring. <br>&#x201c;Popi!&#x201d; screamed Jennifer. <br>&#x201c;Recognize this gun, Otto? Should be real familiar to a Nazi officer,&#x201d; Solomon said, waving the crowd away with his left arm. &#x201c;Look at me, Otto. It&#x2019;s Ben Solomon. Here we are, together again, just like when we were kids. Never thought you&#x2019;d see me again, did you, Hauptscharf�hrer Piatek?&#x201d; <br>Rosenzweig held up his hands in conciliation. The room was silent except for the words he delivered, slowly and evenly. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made a mistake, sir. My name is Elliot Rosenzweig. It&#x2019;s not Otto. Or Piatek. I&#x2019;ve never been a Nazi. In fact, sir, I am a camp survivor.&#x201d; <br>Very slowly, he held out his left arm. &#x201c;Jennifer, undo my cuff link and roll up my sleeve.&#x201d; <br>As she did, his forearm displayed the blackened tattoo: A93554. <br>The gunman considered the offering, and then sneered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lying Nazi murderer and I can see the fear in your eyes, Hauptscharf�hrer. Scream and cry and beg, Otto, like the innocent women and children who cowered before you. Mothers and fathers and grandparents. People who never hurt a soul. And the babies. All the children.&#x201d; He gestured wildly to the stunned crowd. &#x201c;Tell them who you really are. Look at them all. They&#x2019;re listening. The masquerade is finished.&#x201d; <br>From out of nowhere, Solomon was blindsided and knocked to the marble floor. The gun slid along the tiles and came to rest against the staircase. Tackled by a Chicago Bears linebacker in formal attire, Solomon lay curled on the floor, weeping, his head shuttered in his forearms. <br>As he was pulled to his feet by security guards, Solomon screamed, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Nazi. He&#x2019;s a murderer. He&#x2019;s Otto Piatek. He&#x2019;s Otto Piatek.&#x201d; The screams melted into sobs as they led the old man away. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Otto Piatek.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2010, 2013 by Ronald H.

Today we find ourselves in possession of stupendous know-how, which we willingly place in the hands of the most highly skilled and hardworking people. Yet avoidable failures are common, and the reason is simple: the volume and complexity of our knowledge has exceeded our ability to consistently deliver it to people - correctly, safely or efficiently. Atul Gawande makes a compelling argument for the checklist, which he believes to be the most promising strategy in surmounting failure. He looks at how the checklist has allowed pilots to fly airplanes with more power and range than possible before; and how taking this idea to the complicated world of surgery produced a 90-second checklist that reduced surgical deaths and complications in eight hospitals around the world by more than one-third. Along the way, he will show how checklists (which cost next to nothing) actually work, and why some make matters worse while others make matters better. &#34;The Checklist Manifesto&#34; is a fascinating exploration on the nature of complexity in our lives - and how we can best overcome it.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2009</strong>: With a title like <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em>, it would be natural to expect that Atul Gawande is bent on revolutionizing that most loved-hated activity of workers the world over: the to-do list. But it's not the list itself he wants to change; there are no programmatic steps or tables here to help you reshuffle daily tasks. What you'll find instead is a remarkably liberating and persuasive inquiry into what it takes to work successfully and with a personal sense of satisfaction. The first thing you'll realize is that it takes more than just one person to do a job well. This is a toppling revelation made all the more powerful by Gawande's skillful blend of anecdote and practical wisdom as he profiles his own experience as a surgeon and seeks out a wide range of other professions to show that a team is only as strong as its checklist--by his definition, a way of organizing that empowers people at all levels to put their best knowledge to use, communicate at crucial points, and get things done. Like no other book before it, <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em> is at once a restorative call to action and a welcome voice of reason. --<em>Anne Bartholomew<br><br></em> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Malcolm Gladwell Reviews <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i></strong> <br> <br> <b>Malcolm Gladwell was named one of <i>TIME</i> magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2005. He is most recently the author of <i>What the Dog Saw</i> (a collection of his writing from <i>The New Yorker</i>) as well as the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Outliers</i>, <i>The Tipping Point</i>, and <i>Blink</i>. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>Over the past decade, through his writing in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine and his books <i>Complications</i> and <i>Better</i>, Atul Gawande has made a name for himself as a writer of exquisitely crafted meditations on the problems and challenges of modern medicine. His latest book, <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>, begins on familiar ground, with his experiences as a surgeon. But before long it becomes clear that he is really interested in a problem that afflicts virtually every aspect of the modern world--and that is how professionals deal with the increasing complexity of their responsibilities. It has been years since I read a book so powerful and so thought-provoking.</p> <p>Gawande begins by making a distinction between errors of ignorance (mistakes we make because we don't know enough), and errors of ineptitude (mistakes we made because we don&#x2019;t make proper use of what we know). Failure in the modern world, he writes, is really about the second of these errors, and he walks us through a series of examples from medicine showing how the routine tasks of surgeons have now become so incredibly complicated that mistakes of one kind or another are virtually inevitable: it's just too easy for an otherwise competent doctor to miss a step, or forget to ask a key question or, in the stress and pressure of the moment, to fail to plan properly for every eventuality. Gawande then visits with pilots and the people who build skyscrapers and comes back with a solution. Experts need checklists--literally--written guides that walk them through the key steps in any complex procedure. In the last section of the book, Gawande shows how his research team has taken this idea, developed a safe surgery checklist, and applied it around the world, with staggering success.</p> <p>The danger, in a review as short as this, is that it makes Gawande&#x2019;s book seem narrow in focus or prosaic in its conclusions. It is neither. Gawande is a gorgeous writer and storyteller, and the aims of this book are ambitious. Gawande thinks that the modern world requires us to revisit what we mean by expertise: that experts need help, and that progress depends on experts having the humility to concede that they need help. <i>--Malcolm Gladwell </i></p><br>One of the world&#39;s most distinguished doctors, Atul Gawande is a staff writer on the New Yorker, teaches surgery at Harvard Medical School and practises in Boston.

McIntyre proves once again that her plotting and mastery of language are among the best in the business. <i>The Moon and the Sun</i>, which won the 1997 Nebula Award for best novel of the year, is the story of Marie-Jos�phe, a young lady in the court of Louis XIV. When her brother Yves returns from a naturalist voyage with two sea monsters (one live, one dead), Marie-Jos�phe is caught up in a battle of wills involving the fate of the living creature. The king intends to test whether the sea monster holds the secrets of immortality, but Marie-Jos�phe knows the creature to be an intelligent, lonely being who yearns only to be set free. In a monumental test of the limits of patience and love, Marie-Jos�phe defies the will of the king, her brother, and the pope in defense of what she knows is right, at any cost. McIntyre's atmospheric prose envelops the reader in a fully realized world--sights, smells, and sounds are described in great detail. The author completely represents the Sun King's court at Versailles--her research for the book must have been quite extensive. The blend of history, science, and fantasy makes for a book you will want to gulp down. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>In seventeenth-century France, Louis XIV rules with flamboyant ambition. In his domain, wealth and beauty take all; frivolity begets cruelty; science and alchemy collide. From the Hall of Mirrors to the vermin-infested attics of the Chateau at Versailles, courtiers compete to please the king, sacrificing fortune, principles, and even the sacred bond between brother and sister. <p>By the fiftieth year of his reign, Louis XIV has made France the most powerful state in the western world. Yet the Sun King's appetite for glory knows no bounds. In a bold stroke, he sends his natural philosopher on an expedition to seek the source of immortality -- the rare, perhaps mythical, sea monsters. For the glory, of his God, his country, and his king, Father Yves de la Croix returns with his treasures: one heavy shroud packed in ice...and a covered basin that imprisons a shrieking creature.</p></p><h2>Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon (DSB-OT) (Daily Study Bible)</h2><p><p>Fascinating, surprising, challenging--these are among the words used by Robert Davidson to describe the two books covered in this commentary. The book of Ecclesiastes concerns the ultimate meaning of life itself and reminds us that we can be happy even amid uncertainty. The Song of Solomon invites us to an exploration of love that reminds us of God's unending care for the world.</p><p>Carrying forward brilliantly the pattern established by Barclay's New Testament series, the Daily Study Bible has been extended to cover the entire Old Testament as well. Invaluable for individual devotional study, for group discussion, and for classroom use, the Daily Study Bible provides a useful, reliable, and eminently readable way to discover what the Scriptures were saying then and what God is saying today.</p></p><p><b>Robert Davidson</b> is Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Literature at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.</p><h2>The Four Agreements - A Practical Guide To Personal Freedom - A Toltec Wisdom Book</h2><p>Shows some signs of wear, and may have some markings on the inside. 100% Money Back Guarantee.</p><p></p><h2>The Time Between</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Karen White delivers a novel of two generations of sisters and secrets set in the stunning South Carolina Lowcountry. </b><br><br>Eleanor Murray will always remember her childhood on Edisto Island, where her late father, a local shrimper, shared her passion for music.

She grew up in London but now lives with her husband and two children near Atlanta, Georgia.The first time I died was the summer I turned seventeen. I remember the air being so hot you could smell the pluff mud baking in the sun, the scent sulfur-sweet and strong enough to curl your toes, the tall stems of sweetgrass listless, their tips bowed in submission. Blood sat like melted copper in my open mouth as I rose above my broken body, splayed like a rag doll beside the dirt road. <i>Let me go</i>, I thought as I hovered, weightless. But I felt the pull of a gossamer thread of conscience and retribution that tethered me to this earth. Before I heard the screams of the sirens and my mother&#x2019;s wailing, I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t stay dead for long.<p>I watched, suspended between this world and the next, as my mother bent over Eve&#x2019;s body, my sister&#x2019;s legs bent in ways they shouldn&#x2019;t have been. Two paramedics worked on her, trying to push my mother away, while another noticed me, my body nearly hidden in the thick underbrush by the side of the road. He squatted next to me, his fingers reaching for the pulse in my neck. I felt none of this. I watched passively, as if I were a spectator in a movie theater.</p><p>I noticed that the paramedic was young, with thick blond hair on his head and muscled forearms that reflected the sunlight and reminded me of the sweetgrass. I was studying him so intently that I didn&#x2019;t realize that he&#x2019;d begun to perform CPR. Still I felt nothing. I was more focused on my sister and on my mother, who hadn&#x2019;t looked in my direction yet. I hadn&#x2019;t really expected her to.</p><p>And there was Glen, tall and slender and strong, moving between Eve and me, helpless to do anything, his frantic pacing only stirring up dust.</p><p>I heard my name called and thought for a moment it might be my father come to take me away&#x2014;away from the two broken girls and screaming mother and the air that moved in hot, thick waves. Flies buzzed and dipped over the thin trail of blood from my open mouth, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear them or feel them. I was thinking somebody needed to swat them away when I noticed for the first time the wooden church set back behind the trees. When Eve and I had walked our bikes down the dirt road just a short time before, giggling like the little girls we had once been, I hadn&#x2019;t seen it. It seemed impossible that I couldn&#x2019;t have.</p><p>The bright, whitewashed walls and tall steeple shone like a benediction in the relentless sunlight. The words PRAISE HOUSE were hand painted over the top of the arched red door, and a fence with a rusty gate swung as if spirits were passing through. It made no sense for the church to be where it was, nestled between the giant oaks and bright green undergrowth. But the white paint glowed in the sun as if brand-new, the wood steps leading up to the front door smooth and worn from the tread of hundreds of feet. Seated on the bottom step was a large woman with skin the color of burnt charcoal, her fingers working her sewing bone through the strands on a sweetgrass basket. She wasn&#x2019;t looking at me, but I was sure it was she who&#x2019;d called my name.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I wanted to ask, but all I could do was watch her and her fingers and the grass as it was woven into the pattern of the basket.</p><p>Grasping the basket in one hand, she stood and began walking toward where I lay. She stopped for a moment, looking down on me, her shadow blocking the sun from my baking body like the angel of mercy. Slowly she knelt by the paramedic and leaned toward me. He didn&#x2019;t seem to notice the woman as she bent close to my ear. Her words were clear, and I thought I could feel a cool breeze on my cheek from her breath as she spoke. &#x201c;All shut-eye ain&#x2019;t sleep; all good-bye ain&#x2019;t gone.&#x201d;</p><p>The pain struck me like a fist as I was pulled back toward earth, down into the body I&#x2019;d inhabited for seventeen years, and gasped with one long, icy breath. I opened my eyes, meeting the blue eyes of the startled paramedic. I turned my head, searching for the woman, but she and the church were gone. Only the sound of a rusty gate and the lingering scent of the heat-scorched sweetgrass told me that she&#x2019;d been there at all.</p><p>I heard my mother crying out my sister&#x2019;s name over and over as I stared up at the clear blue sky, where a white egret circled slowly overhead. <i>All shut-eye ain&#x2019;t sleep; all good-bye ain&#x2019;t gone</i>. I didn&#x2019;t know what she meant, but I reasoned I&#x2019;d been given another lifetime to figure it out.</p><p>Almost fourteen years later, I was still trying.</p></p><h2>Bridgman&#39;s Complete Guide to Drawing from Life</h2><p>The timeless classic on drawing human figures is back! Following impressive runs by Sterling&#x2019;s previous editions comes a new, redesigned version of George W. Bridgman&#x2019;s landmark work. It combines six well-known books by the celebrated artist and lecturer, who taught figure and anatomy drawing for many years at New York City&#x2019;s Art Students League. This edition preserves Bridgman&#x2019;s lessons and original sketches, but now features a nostalgic, eye-catching cover that distinguishes it from the competition. In its sleek new format, this comprehensive guide will certainly continue its reign as one of the premier figure-drawing publications of all time.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>George Bridgman taught art classes at the Art Student&#39;s League in New York for over 30 years. Many of the best known names in contemporary painting and sculpture were enrolled in those classes.It's rare to find good, comprehensive books on drawing the anatomy. Each of these the first, the return of a classic; the second, a focused study; and the third, lessons from the masters deserves a place on library shelves. Bridgman was a legendary teacher at New York's Art Students' League. There, he originated a system of drawing known as "constructive anatomy." In 1952, his seven books on anatomy were gathered into one volume, which became a standard work at art schools and universities. Published now for the first time in paperback, it holds up as an indispensable volume, with more than 200 illustrations of hands and hundreds of images of arms, shoulders, heads, torsos, legs, knees, and feet. Fairley's book concentrates on those troublesome extremities hands and feet. Sketchbook exercises are followed by eight detailed painting demonstrations in watercolor, oil, and other media. Fairley then continues on to portraits in which variations in age, skin tone, composition, mood, and movement are integrated. Advanced students will find Hale and Coyle's Anatomy Lessons from the Great Masters a rich source of inspiration. Hale, like Bridgman, was one of the great teachers at the Art Students' League. His student, Coyle, gathered together Hale's famous lectures to produce this compendium. Hale drew on principles found in 100 masterpieces by such artists as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, D?rer, Titian, and Rembrandt. In 1995, Giovanni Civardi's trilogy Drawing Human Anatomy (Sterling, 1995), Drawing the Female Nude (Sterling, 1995), and Drawing the Male Nude (LJ 3/15/96. o.p.) reached a high standard for good, basic books in this genre. These three surpass Civardi's works and are highly recommended for serious artists and comprehensive library collections. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>If You Lived In The Days Of The Knights</h2><p>Written in question-and-answer format, provides a look at life in thirteenth century England by discussing how people dressed, what they ate, how a castle was guarded, and more.

A. Stephens was indisputably its most popular writer. Over a period of 55 years, he contributed more than 1,500 stories, but the stories that gained the most fervent readership were fictionalized versions of his recollections of growing up on a small farm in New England.</p><p>Stephens's stories about six orphans who found a home after the Civil War with their grandparents in rural Maine won critical acclaim both when they were first published one hundred years ago and later when a collection was published as<i>Stories from the Old Squire's Farm</i>. "Some of the very best stories of New England life and character that have ever been written," said the<i>Hartford Daily Courant</i>.</p><p>In this new collection of 28 stories, a bank gets robbed, someone steals the Old Squire's new potato hybrid, wolves trap the children overnight, and the Old Squire's mend-all tonic finds a larger, happier audience when a salesman livens up the mixture.</p><p>Although <i>The Youth's Companion</i> ceased publication in 1929, people still write to the librarian in Norway, Maine, or stop by on their summer trips to inquire of the whereabouts of the Old Squire's farm and whatever happened to Addison and Theodora. Such is the enduring power these simple tales have for America's readers.</p></p><p></p><h2>Building Skills in High-Risk Families: Strategies for the Home-Based Practitioner</h2><p>The best techniques available for working in homes with high-risk families are inside this comprehensive manual developed by the highly successful Girls and Boys Town Family Preservation Services program.
